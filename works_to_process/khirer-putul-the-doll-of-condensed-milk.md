# Khirer Putul (The Doll of Condensed Milk)

## Overview

First Bengali fantasy novel, published 1896. Childless second queen (Duorani) creates doll from kheer that miraculously animates. Elder queen's jealousy leads to Duorani's persecution and doll-princess's endangerment. Clever monkey employs wit to deceive king and restore Duorani. Classic fairy tale structure—magical creation, persecution, intervention, restoration—adapted to Bengali cultural specifics. Kheer doll creation (not gingerbread), monkey trickster (not European equivalent), royal justice resolution all draw on Indian narrative traditions. Written when Abanindranath was 25, before his revolutionary Bengal School of Art contributions. Moral complexity distinguishes work from simplistic children's tales: jealous queen's motivations comprehensible, monkey's cleverness borders on morally ambiguous deception. Purnendu Pattrea adapted into 1976 film. Continuous reprinting for 125+ years demonstrates enduring appeal.

## About Abanindranath Tagore

Abanindranath (1871-1951), nephew of Rabindranath Tagore, achieved distinction in both visual and literary arts. Founded Bengal School of Art, revolutionizing Indian painting by modernizing Mughal and Rajput styles to counter Western artistic dominance during colonial period. Iconic "Bharat Mata" painting became nationalist symbol. Made landmark contributions to Bengali children's literature with approximately 370 books—children's stories, art theory, memoirs, cultural studies. Began writing at uncle Rabindranath's insistence, quickly demonstrating Tagore family literary talent spanned multiple members. *Khirer Putul*, written early in career, established templates for indigenous children's fantasy influencing generations of South Asian children's writers.

## Historical Context

Late nineteenth-century Bengal Renaissance witnessed intense cultural, social, and intellectual activity. Tagore family stood at movement's center. Abanindranath's dual achievements in art and literature exemplified Renaissance ideal of cultivating multiple creative disciplines. British colonial education introduced Western children's literature, often with Christian moral frameworks. Indigenous children's fiction was scarce; most Bengali children read translated European fairy tales or didactic moral stories. Abanindranath's creation of fantasy rooted in Indian cultural materials—kheer doll versus gingerbread boy, monkey versus European trickster—asserted cultural autonomy in children's imaginative life. Though written decade before 1905 Swadeshi movement's peak, *Khirer Putul* participated in cultural nationalism by demonstrating Bengali capacity for imaginative literature equal to Western models, arguing Bengali culture possessed adequate imaginative resources without requiring European substitutes.

## Content and Themes

**Narrative Structure**
- Magical creation: a doll formed from sweetened milk becomes animate, establishing the tale’s central wonder.
- Persecution: the elder queen’s envy produces escalating trials for the Duorani and the living doll.
- Intervention: a clever monkey functions as trickster-helper, outwitting power through intelligence.
- Restoration: justice and social harmony are re-established through recognition and redress.

**Maternal Longing**
- The Duorani’s yearning for a child motivates an act of imaginative creation.
- The doll’s animation literalizes the power of desire and nurturance to transform matter into life.
- The theme aligns with devotional narratives where love and attention invite presence and grace.

**Jealousy and Social Dynamics**
- The elder queen’s jealousy reflects domestic hierarchies within polygynous royal households.
- Envy distorts perception, producing cruelty that the story treats seriously without caricature.
- The narrative charts how corrosive emotions disrupt communal balance until countered by courage and wit.

**Wit Versus Authority**
- The monkey’s strategies exemplify the Indian trickster tradition (cunning over force).
- Intelligence, improvisation, and timing repeatedly trump status or rank.
- Children encounter a model of moral ingenuity rather than blind rule-following.

**Identity and Transformation**
- The animated doll raises questions about what constitutes “life,” “personhood,” and “belonging.”
- Play and make-believe are honored as serious modes through which children test reality.
