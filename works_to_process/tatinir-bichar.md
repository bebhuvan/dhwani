## About the Author

Sachindranath Sengupta (1891–1961) wrote for the Bengali stage across genres, contributing to a theatre that increasingly addressed social issues through tighter plotting and naturalistic dialogue.

## Rights Checklist

- India PD: 60 years after author’s death (literary/dramatic/musical/artistic works).
- If translation: translator’s death year governs translation rights.
- Record evidence links for death year(s) and apply rule explicitly in the final entry.

## Duplicate Screening

- Run duplicate check against current catalog using title/author normalization.
- Distinguish new translations/editions from duplicates of the same edition.

## Source Integrity

- Capture the Archive identifier or stable catalog link.
- Prefer scans with complete, legible imprint pages.
- Add a direct file link (PDF/EPUB) if available for accessibility.

## Historical Context

In the 1910s, commercial theatres in Kolkata and beyond were shifting from mythological spectacle to problem plays and social drama. Print editions of scripts circulated widely for reading publics and amateur troupes, helping consolidate a more discursive theatrical culture.

## The Work

- Dramatic device: inquiry/judgment frames character revelation and moral testing.
- Idiom: urban Bengali register supporting rapid exchanges and rhetorical turns.
- Staging: modest settings enable emphasis on actors’ delivery over elaborate sets.

## Significance

- Documents the transition from spectacle to social argument on the Bengali stage.
- Useful to historians of modern Bangla theatre tracing dialogue‑centered dramaturgy.
- Provides a primary source for studying audience expectations and censorship climates of the period.

## Editions & Sources

- Confirm publisher/printer, city, and year on title/verso; note any series information.
- If a cast list or production note appears, record it for stage history.
- Record the Internet Archive identifier and, if possible, a direct PDF link.

## Reading Guide

- Map act/scene structure and track how evidence is introduced and weighed.
- Note speech rhythms for key roles; consider how they play in live performance.

## Performance Notes

- Blocking should emphasize interrogation lines of sight; avoid over‑staging that distracts from dialogue.
- Use lighting to mark shifts between deliberation and revelation.
- Costuming can signal social status and moral posture; document choices for reproducibility.

## Notes for Curators

- Capture any dramatis personae and preface material as evidence of intended staging.
- If multiple printings exist, compare pagination and scene divisions.

## Analytical Questions

- What problem of interpretation does the text ask the reader to solve?
- How does diction (plain, elevated, technical) serve the argument or mood?
- Where does form (meter, prose cadence, scene structure) direct attention?
- What transitions mark shifts in time, perspective, or method?
- Which images or examples bear the argumentative or emotional load?
- How does the work balance tradition and innovation in its genre?
- What ethical claims are explicit, and which are implied by selection or framing?
- How are audience and purpose signaled in openings, prefaces, or asides?
- Where does the text resist paraphrase; what is gained or lost by summary?
- How do closing gestures (moral, question, silence) shape the after‑sense?

## Comparative Pairings

- Pair with one earlier and one later work in the same genre; track continuity and change.
- Compare with a vernacular/English translation to study choices of equivalence.
- Read alongside one critical essay; test its method against this text.
- Contrast with a work from a different region treating a similar theme.
- Examine how editorial apparatus (preface, notes) mediates reading across editions.
- Compare prose and verse treatments (if applicable) of a shared motif.
- Place beside a visual or performance representation; map gains/losses across media.
- Pair with one contemporary review (if findable) to recover reception context.
- Cross‑read with a policy or pedagogical document to see institutional echoes.
- Align with a dictionary/lexicon entry for key terms to fix technical nuance.

## Key Terms for Notes

- Define 8–12 terms that recur (technical, stylistic, thematic) using the edition’s spelling.
- Track aliases and transliteration variants to aid search across catalogs.
- Distinguish authorial coinages from inherited technical vocabulary.
- Record names and places with brief identifiers (person, movement, institution).
- Note recurring metaphors and their literal domains (nature, craft, law, devotion).
- Map one concept’s semantic field as used here vs. elsewhere in the tradition.

## Study Assignments

- Produce a 300‑word close reading of one paragraph/stanza/scene.
- Outline the table of contents and propose a two‑lecture plan.
- Prepare a glossary with 15 entries and two usage examples each.
- Compile a timeline linking text events to historical dates where relevant.
- Draft three examination questions targeting (a) recall, (b) analysis, (c) synthesis.
- Prepare a 5‑slide teaching deck with images/tables cited from the edition.
- Annotate one page facsimile with seals, marginalia, or typographic features.
- Propose an excerpt (1–3 pages) suitable for undergraduate syllabi with rationale.

## Appendix: Curatorial TODOs

- Verify imprint (publisher, city, year) from title and verso pages.
- Extract table of contents and add to the tracker with page spans.
- List proper names (people/places) with brief identifiers for searchability.
- Capture one page image to assess scan quality (contrast, margins, diacritics).
- Note any missing or repeated pages; flag need for alternate scans.
- Record edition‑specific features (preface, appendix, index) for citation.
- Prepare a 5–7 sentence abstract anchored in edition facts (no speculation).
- Identify two candidate excerpts (1–3 pages) suitable for teaching.
- Confirm PD status for all contributors/components (if anthology/translation).
- Add Archive identifier and direct file links to the tracker.
