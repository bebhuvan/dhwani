## About the Author

Kshitimohan Sen (1880–1960) was a noted scholar of Indian devotional literature associated with Santiniketan, known for making vernacular devotional materials accessible in English and Bengali.

## Rights Checklist

- India PD: 60 years after author’s death (literary/dramatic/musical/artistic works).
- If translation: translator’s death year governs translation rights.
- Record evidence links for death year(s) and apply rule explicitly in the final entry.

## Duplicate Screening

- Run duplicate check against current catalog using title/author normalization.
- Distinguish new translations/editions from duplicates of the same edition.

## Source Integrity

- Capture the Archive identifier or stable catalog link.
- Prefer scans with complete, legible imprint pages.
- Add a direct file link (PDF/EPUB) if available for accessibility.
 
## Historical Context
 
Early academic and public introductions to bhakti in English shaped how generations approached Sant poetry, often through selections and biographical sketches that complemented textual study.
 
## The Work
 
- Coverage: north and south Indian bhakti lineages, key poets, doctrinal orientations (verify exact table of contents).
- Method: translated excerpts with connective historical and theological framing.
 
## Significance
 
- A formative Anglophone introduction to medieval Indian devotional literature.
- Useful to courses in Indian religions and comparative mysticism.
 
## Editions & Sources
 
- Confirm imprint details; record whether selections are newly translated or excerpted from prior anthologies.

## Reading Guide

- Choose one poet and trace how the selection exemplifies teaching on love, knowledge, or surrender.
- Compare translation choices across two poets to see how meter and diction are handled.

## Notes for Curators

- Extract table of contents and list poets covered with page spans for indexing.

## Analytical Questions

- What problem of interpretation does the text ask the reader to solve?
- How does diction (plain, elevated, technical) serve the argument or mood?
- Where does form (meter, prose cadence, scene structure) direct attention?
- What transitions mark shifts in time, perspective, or method?
- Which images or examples bear the argumentative or emotional load?
- How does the work balance tradition and innovation in its genre?
- What ethical claims are explicit, and which are implied by selection or framing?
- How are audience and purpose signaled in openings, prefaces, or asides?
- Where does the text resist paraphrase; what is gained or lost by summary?
- How do closing gestures (moral, question, silence) shape the after‑sense?

## Comparative Pairings

- Pair with one earlier and one later work in the same genre; track continuity and change.
- Compare with a vernacular/English translation to study choices of equivalence.
- Read alongside one critical essay; test its method against this text.
- Contrast with a work from a different region treating a similar theme.
- Examine how editorial apparatus (preface, notes) mediates reading across editions.
- Compare prose and verse treatments (if applicable) of a shared motif.
- Place beside a visual or performance representation; map gains/losses across media.
- Pair with one contemporary review (if findable) to recover reception context.
- Cross‑read with a policy or pedagogical document to see institutional echoes.
- Align with a dictionary/lexicon entry for key terms to fix technical nuance.

## Key Terms for Notes

- Define 8–12 terms that recur (technical, stylistic, thematic) using the edition’s spelling.
- Track aliases and transliteration variants to aid search across catalogs.
- Distinguish authorial coinages from inherited technical vocabulary.
- Record names and places with brief identifiers (person, movement, institution).
- Note recurring metaphors and their literal domains (nature, craft, law, devotion).
- Map one concept’s semantic field as used here vs. elsewhere in the tradition.

## Study Assignments

- Produce a 300‑word close reading of one paragraph/stanza/scene.
- Outline the table of contents and propose a two‑lecture plan.
- Prepare a glossary with 15 entries and two usage examples each.
- Compile a timeline linking text events to historical dates where relevant.
- Draft three examination questions targeting (a) recall, (b) analysis, (c) synthesis.
- Prepare a 5‑slide teaching deck with images/tables cited from the edition.
- Annotate one page facsimile with seals, marginalia, or typographic features.
- Propose an excerpt (1–3 pages) suitable for undergraduate syllabi with rationale.

## Appendix: Curatorial TODOs

- Verify imprint (publisher, city, year) from title and verso pages.
- Extract table of contents and add to the tracker with page spans.
- List proper names (people/places) with brief identifiers for searchability.
- Capture one page image to assess scan quality (contrast, margins, diacritics).
- Note any missing or repeated pages; flag need for alternate scans.
- Record edition‑specific features (preface, appendix, index) for citation.
- Prepare a 5–7 sentence abstract anchored in edition facts (no speculation).
- Identify two candidate excerpts (1–3 pages) suitable for teaching.
- Confirm PD status for all contributors/components (if anthology/translation).
- Add Archive identifier and direct file links to the tracker.
