# Chalantika: Adhunik Bangabhashar Abhidhan

## Overview

Chalantikā is a modern Bengali dictionary (abhidhān) by Rajshekhar Basu ‘Parashuram’, notable for clear definitions, usage examples, and attention to contemporary idiom. It serves readers seeking concise explanations without heavy philological apparatus.

## About the Author

Rajshekhar Basu (Parashuram) (1880–1960) is a major Bengali prose stylist and humorist; his lexicographic work reflects care for living usage as much as for classical inheritance.

## Rights Checklist

- India PD: 60 years after author’s death (literary/dramatic/musical/artistic works).
- If translation: translator’s death year governs translation rights.
- Record evidence links for death year(s) and apply rule explicitly in the final entry.

## Duplicate Screening

- Run duplicate check against current catalog using title/author normalization.
- Distinguish new translations/editions from duplicates of the same edition.

## Source Integrity

- Capture the Archive identifier or stable catalog link.
- Prefer scans with complete, legible imprint pages.
- Add a direct file link (PDF/EPUB) if available for accessibility.

## The Work

- Coverage: contemporary Bengali lexicon with cross‑references; verify scope and organization from the scan.
- Features: abbreviated etymologies, usage examples, potential inclusion of technical terms.
- Audience: students, journalists, general readers; a bridge between large philological dictionaries and small glossaries.

## Significance

- Captures a linguistic moment; illuminates how everyday and literary usage were codified mid‑century.
- Valuable for style and translation decisions in Bengali writing.

## Editorial & Preservation Notes

- IA scan mentions missing pages (e.g., 504–505). Curators should locate a complete copy or annotate gaps.

## Reading Guide

- Sample an entry cluster (e.g., derivatives around a root) to see how semantic fields are mapped.

## Analytical Questions

- What problem of interpretation does the text ask the reader to solve?
- How does diction (plain, elevated, technical) serve the argument or mood?
- Where does form (meter, prose cadence, scene structure) direct attention?
- What transitions mark shifts in time, perspective, or method?
- Which images or examples bear the argumentative or emotional load?
- How does the work balance tradition and innovation in its genre?
- What ethical claims are explicit, and which are implied by selection or framing?
- How are audience and purpose signaled in openings, prefaces, or asides?
- Where does the text resist paraphrase; what is gained or lost by summary?
- How do closing gestures (moral, question, silence) shape the after‑sense?

## Comparative Pairings

- Pair with one earlier and one later work in the same genre; track continuity and change.
- Compare with a vernacular/English translation to study choices of equivalence.
- Read alongside one critical essay; test its method against this text.
- Contrast with a work from a different region treating a similar theme.
- Examine how editorial apparatus (preface, notes) mediates reading across editions.
- Compare prose and verse treatments (if applicable) of a shared motif.
- Place beside a visual or performance representation; map gains/losses across media.
- Pair with one contemporary review (if findable) to recover reception context.
- Cross‑read with a policy or pedagogical document to see institutional echoes.
- Align with a dictionary/lexicon entry for key terms to fix technical nuance.

## Key Terms for Notes

- Define 8–12 terms that recur (technical, stylistic, thematic) using the edition’s spelling.
- Track aliases and transliteration variants to aid search across catalogs.
- Distinguish authorial coinages from inherited technical vocabulary.
- Record names and places with brief identifiers (person, movement, institution).
- Note recurring metaphors and their literal domains (nature, craft, law, devotion).
- Map one concept’s semantic field as used here vs. elsewhere in the tradition.

## Study Assignments

- Produce a 300‑word close reading of one paragraph/stanza/scene.
- Outline the table of contents and propose a two‑lecture plan.
- Prepare a glossary with 15 entries and two usage examples each.
- Compile a timeline linking text events to historical dates where relevant.
- Draft three examination questions targeting (a) recall, (b) analysis, (c) synthesis.
- Prepare a 5‑slide teaching deck with images/tables cited from the edition.
- Annotate one page facsimile with seals, marginalia, or typographic features.
- Propose an excerpt (1–3 pages) suitable for undergraduate syllabi with rationale.

## Appendix: Curatorial TODOs

- Verify imprint (publisher, city, year) from title and verso pages.
- Extract table of contents and add to the tracker with page spans.
- List proper names (people/places) with brief identifiers for searchability.
- Capture one page image to assess scan quality (contrast, margins, diacritics).
- Note any missing or repeated pages; flag need for alternate scans.
- Record edition‑specific features (preface, appendix, index) for citation.
- Prepare a 5–7 sentence abstract anchored in edition facts (no speculation).
- Identify two candidate excerpts (1–3 pages) suitable for teaching.
- Confirm PD status for all contributors/components (if anthology/translation).
- Add Archive identifier and direct file links to the tracker.
