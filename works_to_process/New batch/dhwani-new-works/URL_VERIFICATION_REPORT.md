- ⚠️ **30% timeout/broken** - Mostly due to Archive.org timeouts and Wikipedia parentheses issues

---

## Detailed Breakdown

### 1. Malformed URLs
**Count:** 0

All URLs are properly formatted according to RFC standards.

### 2. Accessible URLs
**Count:** 206 (69.8%)

The majority of URLs are accessible and respond correctly. These include:
- Wikipedia article links
- Project Gutenberg resources  
- Sacred-texts.com references
- Wikidata and Wikisource entries
- Britannica references

### 3. Broken/Inaccessible URLs
**Count:** 89 (30.2%)

Broken URLs fall into three categories:

#### A. Archive.org Timeout Issues (61 URLs)
**Status:** Likely accessible but timed out during verification

Archive.org URLs that timed out include DLI (Digital Library of India) collections:
- `archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.*` (multiple instances)
- Various historical text archives
- These timeouts are likely due to:
  - Server load at time of checking
  - Slow response times for archive retrieval
  - Network latency

**Recommendation:** These URLs are likely valid but slow to respond. Manual verification recommended.

#### B. Wikipedia Parentheses Issues (21 URLs)
**Status:** Broken due to missing closing parentheses

Wikipedia URLs with unclosed parentheses return 404 errors:
- `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indica_(Al-Biruni` ❌ (missing closing `)`)
- `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80tman_(Hinduism` ❌
- `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narayana_(Pandit` ❌
- `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit_prose` ❌ (actual 404)
- `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varna_(Hinduism` ❌
- `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasa_(aesthetics` ❌
- `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kularnava_Tantra` ❌
- `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaula_(Tantra` ❌
- `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prakarana` ❌
- `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandakranta` ❌
- `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C5%9Bvarak%E1%B9%9B%E1%B9%A3%E1%B9%87a` ❌
- `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharangadeva` ❌
- `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaisheshika_Sutras` ❌
- `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanada_(philosopher` ❌
- `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atman_(Hinduism` ❌
- `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_(religion` ❌
- `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasastilaka` ❌
- `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somadeva_(Jain_author` ❌
- `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Murdoch_(literary_evangelist` ❌

**Recommendation:** Fix markdown link formatting to properly escape or include closing parentheses.

#### C. Unicode/Encoding Issues (7 URLs)
**Status:** Script encoding errors

Some URLs with special characters failed due to ASCII encoding limitations:
- `https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclopædia_Britannica/Sanskrit` (æ character)
- URLs with Sanskrit diacritics (ā, ṇ, ṃ, etc.)

**Recommendation:** Ensure proper URL encoding for special characters.

#### D. Other 404 Errors (1 URL)
- `https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/duv/index.htm` - Genuine 404

---

### 4. Redirected URLs
**Count:** 3 (1.0%)

All redirects are benign and remain within the same domain:

1. **OpenLibrary Work Pages** - Redirect to full title pages
   - `OL23652408W` → Full title with Atharvaveda details
   - `OL18303208W` → Full Kautilya Arthashastra title

2. **OpenLibrary Author Pages**
   - `OL9548456A` → Geeta Rana author page

**Status:** ✅ Safe redirects, no domain changes detected
