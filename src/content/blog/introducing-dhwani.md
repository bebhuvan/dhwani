A civilization with millennia of literary tradition has no Project Gutenberg of its own.

That sentence has bothered me for a while now. Not in a productive, "let me fix this" way—more in the passive-aggressive way you ignore a leaking faucet because dealing with it means admitting the problem exists.

India has produced some of humanity's most profound texts. The Vedas. The Upanishads. Kalidasa's poetry. Tagore's novels. Centuries of philosophy, drama, religious thought, colonial history. Most of it exists in the public domain. Much of it has been digitized—scattered across Archive.org, Project Gutenberg, Wikisource, forgotten university repositories.

But there's no central place to find it all.

## Why Dhwani exists

I didn't set out to build a digital library. That would require skills, money, and institutional backing I don't have. Scanning fragile manuscripts, OCR-ing degraded texts, cataloging properly—that's real work. Others have done it. Archive.org has done it. The Internet Archive has preserved what institutions couldn't be bothered to.

What doesn't exist is a simple answer to: "Where can I read this?"

That's what Dhwani is. A directory. An index. A collection of links pointing to works that are already freely available, organized so you can actually find them.

The name—*dhwani*—means "sound" or "resonance" in Sanskrit (and several other Indian languages, because we're efficient that way). It also means "suggestion" or "implication" in poetics, which felt appropriate for a project that's basically one long implication that we should care more about this stuff.

## What's in it

Right now: **698 works**. Everything from the Rigveda to Premchand's novels. Sanskrit grammar treatises. Colonial-era histories (written by colonizers—it's complicated). Jain philosophy. Buddhist sutras. Tagore's *Gitanjali*. Translations of the Mahabharata. Kipling's *Kim* (yes, really—colonialism is part of the story).

Every work links to where you can read it for free—usually Archive.org or Project Gutenberg. No paywalls. No subscriptions. No university login required.

I'm not hosting the texts. I'm not claiming to have done the hard work. I'm just pointing at what already exists and saying: "Here. This is ours. Go read it."

## Why this probably won't work

Let's be honest—people don't read this stuff. Not really. We talk about preserving cultural heritage, but how many of us have actually read the Arthashastra? Or the Natyashastra? Or even the full Bhagavad Gita instead of inspirational quotes on Instagram?

There's a certain exhausting quality to caring about things nobody else seems to care about. You build something like this knowing full well it'll get less traffic than a meme page. That's fine. The works will still be there. The links will still work (until Archive.org's servers melt or capitalism finally kills the internet).

Maybe someone writing a novel will find inspiration in a forgotten folk tale. Maybe a student will stumble on a historical text that changes how they see the past. Maybe it'll just sit there, quietly existing, which is more than can be said for most of what we create.

## What happens next

More works. Better organization. Maybe some blog posts about specific texts or authors (someone should write about the absolute chaos that is trying to date ancient Indian texts—it's hilarious and depressing).

If you find a broken link, let me know. If you know of a work that should be included, tell me. If you think this whole thing is pointless—you're probably right, but I'm doing it anyway.

The works are there. They've always been there. Now they're a little easier to find.

That's all this is. A directory. A small act of pointing. Nothing grand. Nothing world-changing. Just—here, look, these exist.

Go read something.
