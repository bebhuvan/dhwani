# The Sacred Laws of the Âryas: As Taught in the Schools of Âpastamba, Gautama, Vâsishtha, and Baudhâyana

This foundational work presents the earliest systematic legal traditions of ancient India through four crucial Dharmasutra texts. Compiled and translated by Georg Bühler as part of the prestigious Sacred Books of the East series, these ancient legal codes provide comprehensive guidance on social conduct, governance, religious practices, and jurisprudence that shaped Hindu civilization from the 6th century BCE onward.

## About the Authors

The **original authors** - **Apastamba**, **Gautama**, **Vasishtha**, and **Baudhayana** - were ancient Indian sages and legal scholars whose teachings formed the foundation of Hindu legal tradition. These texts represent some of the oldest legal literature in human history, predating Roman law and providing sophisticated frameworks for social organization, ethics, and governance.

**Georg Bühler** (1837-1898) was a distinguished German Indologist whose scholarly translations made ancient Indian legal texts accessible to international scholarship. As a professor at the University of Vienna and contributor to the Sacred Books of the East series, Bühler's meticulous work preserved and transmitted foundational texts of Indian civilization to modern academic study.

## Significance

These Dharmasutras represent crucial contributions to understanding how ancient Indian society developed sophisticated legal and ethical frameworks that influenced centuries of social organization. The texts demonstrate the early development of concepts like due process, property rights, social justice, and governance principles that continue to influence legal thinking today.

Bühler's translation work bridged ancient Sanskrit scholarship with modern legal studies, making these foundational texts accessible to comparative jurisprudence and historical legal research while preserving their original cultural context.

## Digital Access
