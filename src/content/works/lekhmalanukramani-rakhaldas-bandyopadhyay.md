  Lekhmalanukramani Vol. 1, Part 1 represents a seminal scholarly contribution to Indian epigraphic studies during the transformative early 20th-century period of archaeological and historical research. Published in 1923, this comprehensive Sanskrit inscription concordance emerged during a critical moment of indigenous scholarly engagement with India's material cultural heritage, coinciding with nascent archaeological methodologies developed under and against British colonial scholarship. Rakhaldas Bandyopadhyay, a pioneering Bengali archaeologist and historian, meticulously compiled this reference work to systematically catalog and classify Sanskrit inscriptions from ancient and medieval India, providing researchers with an unprecedented analytical framework for understanding dynastic, linguistic, and sociocultural developments. The work's sophisticated subject classification system enables paleographical analysis, allowing scholars to trace linguistic evolution, political transformations, and cultural practices across diverse regional contexts. By methodically organizing epigraphic sources—ranging from royal edicts and temple records to administrative documents—Bandyopadhyay constructed a nuanced methodological approach that transcended colonial-era interpretive limitations. His rigorous documentation techniques significantly advanced scholarly understanding of India's complex historical landscape, offering insights into administrative structures, religious practices, economic systems, and linguistic transitions across multiple dynasties and geographical regions. Beyond its immediate scholarly utility, the Lekhmalanukramani represents a critical intervention in reclaiming and systematizing indigenous historical knowledge, challenging prevailing colonial narratives by centering Indian scholarly perspectives and methodological approaches. As a foundational text in Indian epigraphy, this work continues to serve as an essential reference for researchers in archaeology, linguistics, history, and cultural studies, embodying the intellectual sophistication of early 20th-century Indian scholarship.

# Lekhmalanukramani Vol. 1, Part 1

## Overview

The Lekhmalanukramani is an epigraphic concordance and systematic index of Sanskrit inscriptions from ancient and medieval India, edited by the eminent archaeologist and historian Sri Rakhaldas Bandyopadhyay (also known as R.D. Banerji) and published in 1923. The title translates roughly as "Sequential Index of Inscription Collections," reflecting its function as a research tool for accessing India's vast epigraphic corpus.

## Historical Context

Rakhaldas Bandyopadhyay (1885-1930) was a pioneering Indian archaeologist who discovered the Indus Valley Civilization site at Mohenjo-daro and served as officer of the Archaeological Survey of India. His compilation of this epigraphic index came during a period of intensive cataloguing of India's inscriptions—work essential for reconstructing ancient Indian history, chronology, and language development. The early 20th century saw systematic efforts to make India's scattered epigraphic materials accessible to researchers through such reference works.

## Content

**Scope**: Catalogs and indexes Sanskrit inscriptions from various periods and regions of India, providing researchers with systematic access to primary epigraphic sources.

**Organization**: Arranged by subject classification and categories to facilitate scholarly research, allowing historians to locate inscriptions relevant to specific dynasties, regions, religious institutions, or time periods.

**Research Function**: Serves as essential finding aid for:
- Chronological studies and dynastic reconstructions
- Paleographical analysis and script development
- Historical linguistics and Sanskrit language evolution
- Social and religious history through primary sources
- Verification and cross-referencing of historical data

**Methodology**: Employs systematic cataloguing principles, providing standardized information for each inscription including location, date (when determinable), script type, content summary, and publication references.

## Significance

**For Historical Research**: Inscriptions constitute crucial primary sources for ancient and medieval Indian history, often providing the only contemporary evidence for dynasties, events, and social practices. This index made such materials systematically accessible.

**For Linguistic Studies**: Inscriptions document the historical development of Sanskrit and Prakrit languages, script evolution, and regional variations—essential data for historical linguistics.

**For Paleography**: Facilitates study of script development across regions and time periods, contributing to the scientific dating and authentication of inscriptions and manuscripts.

**Scholarly Legacy**: Represents early 20th-century Indian scholarship's efforts to organize and make accessible the nation's historical materials, enabling subsequent generations of research.

The work exemplifies how reference tools enable scholarly progress by organizing scattered primary sources into systematic, searchable formats.

## How to Access

Available through Internet Archive (Digital Library of India collection). Public domain reference work freely accessible for research in epigraphy, ancient Indian history, paleography, and Sanskrit studies.
