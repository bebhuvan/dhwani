description: '"The Birth of the War-God: A Poem by Kálidása" is a poetic work translated
  into English by Ralph T. H. Griffith, likely written in the early centuries AD.
  This poem, attributed to the renowned Indian poet Kálidása, explores themes of love,
  celestial beings, and divine intervention, particularly revolving around the characters
  Umá and Śiva.   At the start of the poem, Kálidása introduces the majestic mountain
  Himálaya, which serves as a backdrop for the birth of Umá, the daughter of the mountain
  king. The narrative unfolds with the beauty and nobility of Umá, described in rich,
  vivid imagery, while alluding to her union with Śiva, the god of destruction and
  transformation. As the opening continues, it delves into the cosmic events leading
  to the love story between Umá and Śiva, hinting at the divine stakes involved; Kálidāsa
  expertly intertwines natural beauty with divine destiny, all while establishing
  a rich tapestry of emotions that sets the stage for a grand epic of love and power.'
