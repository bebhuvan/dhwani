# The Sacred Books of the East
## Volume I: The Upanishads, Part 1

## Overview

In 1879, Oxford University Press published the first volume of what would become one of the most ambitious and influential scholarly projects of the Victorian era: *The Sacred Books of the East*, a fifty-volume series that would, over three decades, bring the sacred texts of Asian religions—Hinduism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Taoism, Confucianism, Jainism, and Islam—to English-speaking readers for the first time in authoritative scholarly translations.

The series was conceived and edited by Friedrich Max Müller, the German-born British scholar who had already revolutionized the study of ancient India through his editions of the Rigveda and pioneering work in comparative philology and mythology. Müller chose to inaugurate the series with his own translation of the Upanishads, the philosophical texts that represent the summit of Vedic speculation and the foundation of Hindu metaphysical thought.

This 846-page first volume contains Müller's translations of key Upanishadic texts accompanied by extensive introductions, scholarly notes, and comparative analysis. Published at Clarendon Press, Oxford, the volume established the scholarly standards and presentation format that would characterize the entire series: rigorous philological accuracy combined with philosophical sensitivity, comprehensive annotation, and accessibility to educated non-specialist readers.

The appearance of this volume marked a watershed moment in Western understanding of Indian philosophy. While earlier translators had rendered some Upanishadic passages, Müller's was the first comprehensive, scholarly translation based on critical editions of Sanskrit texts and informed by deep engagement with Indian philosophical traditions. The project responded to growing Western interest in Eastern spirituality while establishing the academic discipline of comparative religion on a firm foundation of primary texts rather than secondhand descriptions.

## About F. Max Müller (1823-1900)

Friedrich Max Müller stands as one of the towering figures in 19th-century Oriental scholarship, a man whose work fundamentally shaped how the West understood Eastern civilizations and how the field of comparative religion developed.

Born in Dessau, Germany in 1823, the son of the Romantic poet Wilhelm Müller, young Friedrich was educated at Leipzig, Berlin, and Paris in classical philology and Sanskrit. His brilliance was recognized early: at age 21, he was entrusted with publishing the first complete edition of the Rigveda based on manuscripts in London, a monumental task he would complete over decades. This work brought him to Oxford in 1846, where he would spend most of his career, eventually becoming Britain's first professor of comparative philology and a naturalized British citizen.

Müller's scholarly contributions spanned multiple fields:

**Sanskrit and Vedic Studies**: His critical editions of the Rigveda with Sayana's commentary established the textual foundation for Vedic studies. He translated numerous Vedic and Upanishadic texts, making ancient Indian literature accessible to European scholarship.

**Comparative Philology**: He advanced the understanding of Indo-European language relationships, tracing linguistic connections between Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, and modern European languages. His lectures on the science of language were foundational texts in linguistics.

**Comparative Mythology**: Müller developed influential (if now largely superseded) theories about how myths originated from misunderstandings of language and natural phenomena, attempting to explain diverse mythologies through common Indo-European origins.

**Comparative Religion**: Most significantly for this project, Müller pioneered the academic study of religion as a comparative, historical discipline. His famous dictum "He who knows one religion knows none" articulated the principle that religions must be studied comparatively to be truly understood.

**Religious Philosophy**: Beyond translation and comparison, Müller engaged philosophically with questions of religious truth, knowledge, and the relationship between different traditions. His approach was broadly sympathetic, seeing truth expressed differently in various religions while maintaining his Christian faith.

Müller's position was complex and has been subject to varied interpretations. Early in his career, he wrote letters expressing hope that his Sanskrit studies would contribute to Christian missionary work by demonstrating the inadequacy of Indian religion. Yet his mature scholarship showed genuine respect for Hindu philosophy, describing India as possessing "some of the most profound philosophical and spiritual insights" in human history. He vigorously opposed racial interpretations of "Aryan" concepts and argued for the spiritual and intellectual sophistication of Indian civilization.

His honors reflected his stature: elected to the Privy Council, awarded the Bavarian Maximilian Order and the Pour le Mérite, member of the French Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. In India, where his work was deeply influential, the Goethe Institutes are called "Max Müller Bhavan" in his honor.

When Müller died in 1900, he left behind a massive scholarly legacy that had transformed multiple academic disciplines and fundamentally altered Western perceptions of Eastern civilizations.

## The Sacred Books of the East: The Complete Project

The *Sacred Books of the East* series represented an unprecedented scholarly undertaking. Over thirty-one years (1879-1910), Oxford University Press published fifty volumes containing English translations of the foundational texts of Asian religions:

**Hindu Texts** (multiple volumes):
- Upanishads (Müller, Roer)
- Bhagavad Gita
- Vedic hymns and Brahmanas
- Laws of Manu and other Dharmasutras
- Vedanta Sutras with commentaries

**Buddhist Texts** (multiple volumes):
- Dhammapada
- Buddhist Suttas
- Vinaya texts (monastic rules)
- Jataka tales
- Mahayana sutras

**Zoroastrian Texts**:
- Zend-Avesta (Yasna, Vendidad, etc.)
- Pahlavi texts

**Jain Texts**:
- Jain Sutras (Akaranga, Kalpa, etc.)

**Chinese Texts**:
- Confucian classics (translated by James Legge)
- Taoist texts (Tao Te Ching, Chuang Tzu)

**Islamic Texts**:
- Selected Qur'anic passages with commentary

Each volume was translated by a specialist in the relevant language and tradition—scholars like Georg Bühler, Hermann Oldenberg, T.W. Rhys Davids, James Darmesteter, and James Legge contributed their expertise. Müller served as general editor, ensuring consistency of approach and scholarly standards across the series.

The project's aims were both scholarly and cultural: to provide reliable translations of primary sources for academic study, to enable comparative religious research, and to educate Western readers about the spiritual and philosophical achievements of Asian civilizations. The series made possible, for the first time, systematic comparative study of world religions based on direct engagement with authoritative texts rather than travelers' accounts or missionary reports.

## The Upanishads: Philosophy of Ultimate Reality

The Upanishads (the name suggests "sitting near" a teacher, implying secret teachings transmitted from master to disciple) represent the philosophical culmination of the Vedic tradition. Composed roughly between 800-200 BCE, these texts mark a decisive turn from the ritualistic emphasis of earlier Vedic literature to profound metaphysical speculation.

The central concerns of the Upanishads include:

**Brahman**: The ultimate reality, the absolute ground of all existence, described as infinite, eternal, unchanging consciousness-existence-bliss (*sat-chit-ananda*).

**Atman**: The individual self or soul, which the Upanishads daringly identify with Brahman in the famous formula *tat tvam asi* ("that thou art")—the ultimate reality and one's innermost self are identical.

**Maya**: The illusory appearance of the world as separate from Brahman; the veil of ignorance that obscures recognition of ultimate unity.

**Moksha**: Liberation from the cycle of birth and death (*samsara*) through the realization of one's identity with Brahman—knowledge (*jnana*) as the path to freedom.

**Karma and Rebirth**: The law of moral causation and the cycle of reincarnation, from which one seeks release through knowledge.

These philosophical themes are explored through dialogues between teachers and students, poetic meditations, symbolic narratives, and direct proclamations of metaphysical truth. The teaching methods range from elaborate cosmological descriptions to stark paradoxes and negations ("not this, not this"—*neti neti*) that point beyond conceptual thought.

The philosophical sophistication of the Upanishads astonished Western readers. Here was idealist metaphysics, monism, mystical experience, and epistemological analysis comparable to anything in Greek philosophy, yet developed independently in ancient India. The texts addressed perennial philosophical questions—the nature of consciousness, the relationship between appearance and reality, the meaning of self and world, the possibility of ultimate knowledge—with depth and rigor.

## Contents of Volume I

Müller's first volume contains translations of several major Upanishads with extensive scholarly apparatus:

**Chandogya Upanishad**: One of the oldest and longest Upanishads, containing famous teachings like the *tat tvam asi* formula and extensive cosmological speculation. The text includes the story of Svetaketu's education and numerous dialogues on the nature of Brahman.

**Talavakara (Kena) Upanishad**: A shorter text focused on the question "by whom" (*kena*) are mind and senses directed—leading to recognition of Brahman as the ultimate subject beyond all objects of knowledge.

**Aitareya Upanishad**: Cosmological speculation on the creation of the universe and the nature of the self, emphasizing consciousness (*prajnana*) as Brahman.

**Kaushitaki Upanishad**: Contains the famous Parable of the Two Birds (also in Mundaka Upanishad) symbolizing the individual soul and the Supreme Self dwelling in the same tree (the body).

**Vajasaneyi (Brihadaranyaka) Upanishad**: The longest and philosophically richest Upanishad, containing the teachings of Yajnavalkya, extensive cosmology, the doctrine of the subtle body, and profound analyses of consciousness and knowledge.

Each translation is accompanied by:
- **Introduction**: Historical and philosophical context for the text
- **Sanskrit text**: Key passages in Devanagari script for scholars
- **Translation**: Müller's English rendering attempting to balance literal accuracy with readability
- **Annotations**: Extensive notes explaining philosophical concepts, textual variants, and connections to other texts
- **Comparative notes**: References to Western philosophical parallels and similar ideas in other religious traditions

Müller's approach aimed to make the texts accessible while respecting their philosophical depth. He avoided both excessive literalism that would produce unintelligible English and free adaptation that would impose foreign concepts. The result captures something of the original's character—its moments of poetic beauty, its logical argumentation, its sudden leaps of mystical insight.

## Müller's Translation Philosophy and Method

Müller brought to the Upanishads both philological rigor and philosophical sensitivity. His method combined:

**Textual Scholarship**: He worked from critical editions of Sanskrit texts, noting variant readings and textual problems. His thorough knowledge of Vedic literature allowed him to explain obscure references and trace concepts through different texts.

**Philosophical Understanding**: Unlike some translators who treat sacred texts as mere linguistic artifacts, Müller engaged with the Upanishads' philosophical arguments. He had studied German idealist philosophy and saw genuine parallels with Upanishadic thought.

**Comparative Framework**: Müller constantly drew comparisons with Greek philosophy, Christian mysticism, and other traditions, helping Victorian readers grasp unfamiliar concepts through familiar analogues. This sometimes imported Western categories but also illuminated genuine similarities.

**Respect for Tradition**: He consulted traditional Indian commentaries (especially Shankara's Advaita Vedanta interpretations) while not being bound by them. This balanced historical and philosophical approaches.

**Accessible Presentation**: Müller wrote for educated non-specialists, explaining concepts clearly without oversimplification. His introductions provided cultural and historical context missing in the texts themselves.

His translations have limitations from a modern perspective. Some interpretations reflect Victorian philosophical assumptions. His reliance on Shankara's Advaita interpretations sometimes obscures other possible readings. More recent scholarship has refined understanding of Vedic language and concepts. Yet Müller's translations remain readable and philosophically engaging, and his pioneering work established the foundation for all subsequent Upanishadic translation.

## Historical Context and Reception

The publication of this volume in 1879 came at a significant moment in Victorian intellectual life. Darwin's *Origin of Species* (1859) had challenged traditional religious certainties, creating an appetite for alternative spiritual perspectives. The growth of empire had brought British administrators and scholars into contact with Indian civilization, generating both fascination and incomprehension.

Western interest in Indian philosophy had been growing since the early 19th century. Schopenhauer had enthusiastically embraced Upanishadic ideas, seeing them as confirmation of his own philosophy. The American Transcendentalists (Emerson, Thoreau) had drawn inspiration from Hindu texts. But access to reliable translations remained limited.

Müller's volume met this need at the highest scholarly level. Reviewers recognized its significance: here was ancient Indian wisdom made accessible in authoritative translation with full scholarly apparatus. The philosophical quality impressed many readers—these were not primitive myths but sophisticated metaphysical arguments.

The impact extended beyond academia:

**Comparative Religion**: The series made possible systematic academic study of world religions, establishing the discipline on a foundation of primary texts.

**Philosophy**: Western philosophers gained access to a major non-Western philosophical tradition, enriching debates about idealism, phenomenology, and consciousness studies.

**Theosophy and New Religious Movements**: Helena Blavatsky's Theosophical Society and other groups drew heavily on texts from Müller's series (often interpreting them quite differently than Müller intended).

**Hindu Renaissance**: In India, the series had complex effects. It validated Indian civilization to Western audiences but through Western scholarly methods. Indian scholars like Vivekananda engaged with Müller's translations while also critiquing Western interpretations of Hindu thought.

**Literary Influence**: Writers from Yeats to Hesse to Aldous Huxley found inspiration in Upanishadic ideas mediated through translations like Müller's.

The series also faced criticism. Some Christian critics objected to treating "pagan" texts as "sacred." Some scholars questioned Müller's interpretations or found his comparative approach forced. Indian nationalists sometimes resented Western scholars claiming authority over Indian texts. Yet even critics acknowledged the project's scholarly achievement and cultural significance.

## The Upanishads and Western Philosophy

Victorian readers encountering the Upanishads found striking resonances with Western philosophical traditions:

**Idealism**: The Upanishadic teaching that ultimate reality is consciousness (Brahman) and that the material world is appearance (maya) paralleled Western idealism from Plato through Berkeley to Hegel. Müller drew explicit comparisons with German idealist philosophy.

**Mysticism**: The Upanishadic emphasis on direct realization of Brahman through meditative knowledge resembled Western mystical traditions (Plotinus, Meister Eckhart, St. John of the Cross) in its paradoxical language and emphasis on transcending conceptual thought.

**Phenomenology**: The Upanishadic analysis of consciousness and its objects, the investigation of the knowing subject, anticipated concerns of later phenomenology and consciousness studies.

**Monism**: The Advaita (non-dualist) interpretation emphasized in Müller's translations presented a form of absolute monism—all apparently separate things are ultimately one reality. This both fascinated and troubled Western readers shaped by dualistic religious traditions.

**Epistemology**: Upanishadic discussions of the limits of conceptual knowledge, the relationship between subject and object, and the possibility of knowledge beyond the mind engaged epistemological questions central to Western philosophy.

These parallels helped Western readers approach the texts but also risked assimilating genuinely different Indian concepts into Western categories. Contemporary scholarship is more attuned to distinctive features of Indian philosophical thought, but the comparative approach opened important dialogues.

## Philosophical and Spiritual Themes

The Upanishads present certain themes with particular force:

**The Inadequacy of Ritual**: While the earlier Vedas emphasized elaborate sacrificial rituals, the Upanishads internalize religion, seeking knowledge (jnana) rather than ritual action (karma) as the path to liberation.

**The Unity of All Existence**: The fundamental teaching that Atman (the self) and Brahman (ultimate reality) are identical implies that separation between self and other, subject and object, is ultimately illusory.

**Knowledge as Liberation**: Moksha (liberation) comes not from good works or devotion alone but from direct realization of one's true nature as Brahman. This experiential knowledge (*anubhava*) transforms one's entire mode of being.

**The Levels of Reality**: The Upanishads often distinguish different levels of reality—the absolute (Brahman), the individual soul (jiva), and the phenomenal world. Understanding their relationship is key to liberation.

**The Inadequacy of Language**: Ultimately, Brahman transcends all concepts and descriptions. Language can point toward the truth but cannot capture it, hence the use of paradox, negation ("not this, not this"), and silence.

**Universal Compassion**: Recognizing the same Self in all beings leads naturally to non-harm (ahimsa) and compassion, as harming another is ultimately harming oneself.

These themes would profoundly influence Hindu philosophy (especially Vedanta schools), Buddhist thought (particularly regarding the nature of self), and later Western spiritual and philosophical movements.

## Scholarly Legacy and Continuing Influence

Müller's *Sacred Books of the East* series had lasting impact on multiple fields:

**Religious Studies**: It established comparative religion as a serious academic discipline, providing the textual foundation for scholarly comparison and analysis. The series demonstrated that rigorous scholarship could be applied to all religious traditions, not just Christianity.

**Indology**: The series advanced Sanskrit studies and Indian philosophy in Western universities. Many subsequent scholars built on the foundations Müller and his collaborators established.

**Translation Studies**: The project raised important questions about translating sacred texts, religious concepts, and philosophical terminology across radical cultural and linguistic differences. Müller's approaches and challenges remain relevant for translators.

**Intercultural Understanding**: Despite limitations and occasional misunderstandings, the series fostered genuine engagement between Western and Eastern intellectual traditions. It made possible dialogues that continue today.

**Religious Dialogue**: The texts facilitated interfaith conversation by providing access to authentic sources from different traditions. While Müller hoped Christianity would triumph through comparison, the actual effect was more complex—genuine appreciation for the wisdom of different traditions.

The volumes remain in print and widely available online, still consulted by scholars, students, and spiritual seekers. While translations have been superseded in many cases by more recent scholarship, Müller's pioneering work retains historical and literary value.

## Critical Assessment

From a contemporary perspective, both achievements and limitations are evident:

**Achievements**:
- Made authoritative translations of Eastern sacred texts widely available for the first time
- Established high scholarly standards for translation and annotation
- Fostered comparative study of world religions based on primary sources
- Demonstrated the philosophical sophistication of non-Western traditions
- Trained multiple generations of scholars in Oriental languages and religions

**Limitations**:
- The very concept of "the East" as a unified category lumped together diverse traditions with little in common beyond not being European
- Victorian philosophical assumptions sometimes colored interpretations
- The selection and framing of texts sometimes reflected Western interests more than indigenous priorities
- Heavy reliance on particular interpretive traditions (like Shankara for Upanishads) obscured textual diversity
- Limited attention to lived religious practice as opposed to textual tradition
- The project remained a Western scholarly enterprise, with minimal Indian scholarly participation

Modern scholars approach these texts with more sophisticated awareness of cultural difference, gender dynamics, power relations in colonial scholarship, and the complexity of translation. Yet they build on foundations Müller and his collaborators laid.

## The Upanishads in Modern Thought

The Upanishadic ideas introduced to Western audiences through Müller's translation have had remarkable afterlives:

**Philosophy**: From Schopenhauer's enthusiasm to contemporary philosophy of mind's interest in consciousness studies, Upanishadic concepts continue to engage Western philosophers.

**Psychology**: Jung drew on Upanishadic symbolism; consciousness researchers explore Upanishadic accounts of meditative states; transpersonal psychology engages Upanishadic models of the self.

**Physics**: Some quantum physicists (controversially) have found parallels between Upanishadic non-dualism and quantum mechanics' challenge to subject-object dualism.

**Environmentalism**: The Upanishadic teaching of fundamental unity with all existence has inspired ecological philosophy and environmental ethics.

**Interfaith Dialogue**: The Upanishads remain central to conversations between Hindu and Christian mystical traditions, comparative theology, and religious pluralism debates.

**Spiritual Movements**: From Vedanta societies to contemporary neo-Advaita teachers, the Upanishadic teaching of non-duality continues to attract spiritual seekers.

Whether these modern appropriations accurately reflect the ancient texts is debatable. But they demonstrate the enduring power of Upanishadic ideas to challenge conventional thinking and inspire new perspectives.

## This Edition and Digital Preservation

This digitized edition from the Internet Archive preserves the original 1879 publication from the University of Illinois collection. Making it freely available online ensures continued access to this foundational text in the history of comparative religion and cross-cultural understanding.

For scholars of religious studies, Indology, Victorian intellectual history, or the history of Oriental scholarship, this volume provides invaluable primary source material. For students encountering the Upanishads, Müller's translation offers a readable introduction with substantial scholarly support. For anyone interested in the history of how Western and Eastern intellectual traditions have engaged each other, this volume marks a crucial moment.

The Upanishads themselves remain living texts, continuing to inspire philosophical reflection, spiritual practice, and cross-cultural dialogue. Through Müller's translation—with all its Victorian assumptions and scholarly limitations—they first spoke to a wide Western audience, initiating conversations that continue to this day about the nature of reality, consciousness, self, and the possibility of ultimate knowledge.

*The Sacred Books of the East* project represented Max Müller's conviction that understanding other religions and cultures would advance human knowledge and mutual respect. Whatever its limitations, the project succeeded in making the sacred texts of Eastern traditions available to Western scholarship and general readers, fundamentally expanding the horizons of religious understanding. This first volume, presenting the philosophical heart of Vedic wisdom, inaugurated a transformation in how the West understood both India and the diversity of human religious and philosophical achievement.
