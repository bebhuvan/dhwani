description: "The Kurma Purana ranks among the eighteen Mahapuranas, distinctively narrated by Vishnu in his Kurma (tortoise) avatara form, comprising approximately 18,000 verses synthesizing Shaiva and Vaishnavite traditions. Composed between 6th-8th centuries CE (with core material likely around 600 CE), this text presents: creation cosmology explaining universe's evolution from primordial matter through divine agency, extensive mythology including churning of cosmic ocean (samudra-manthana) where Kurma avatara supports Mount Mandara enabling gods and demons to extract amrita (immortality nectar), detailed sacred geography describing pilgrimage sites and their spiritual significance, four-fold life goals (purusharthas) of dharma, artha, kama, and moksha with elaborate prescriptions for their attainment, genealogies connecting divine and royal lineages, systematic exposition of yoga philosophy and practice, and elaborate temple construction and deity worship protocols. The text exhibits remarkable theological balance: while narrated by Vishnu as Kurma, it extensively glorifies Shiva, particularly through detailed description of Shiva's Ishvara-gita teachings paralleling the Bhagavad Gita's theological synthesis. The Kurma Purana represents significant attempt at Shaiva-Vaishnava synthesis during period of sectarian competition, asserting both traditions' validity while maintaining narrative framework centered on Vishnu avatara. The text's influence on Hindu temple architecture, iconography, philosophical theology, and devotional synthesis demonstrates Puranic literature's capacity to accommodate diverse traditions within comprehensive religious worldview."
