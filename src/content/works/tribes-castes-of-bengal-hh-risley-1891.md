# The Tribes and Castes of Bengal

## Overview

Herbert Hope Risley's monumental four-volume work represents the most comprehensive colonial-era ethnographic survey of Bengal's diverse populations. Published by the Bengal Secretariat Press in 1891-1892, this massive compilation resulted from the 1885 Ethnographic Survey of Bengal, which employed extensive staff to systematically document the ethnographic characteristics and anthropometric measurements of Bengali communities. The work profoundly influenced colonial governance, census operations, and administrative policies while establishing methodologies—now thoroughly discredited—that attempted to scientifically classify Indian populations through racial hierarchies based on physical measurements.

Despite its flawed theoretical foundations in 19th-century scientific racism, the work remains a significant historical document. It preserves detailed observations of late 19th-century Bengali society, documents communities whose practices have since transformed, and reveals the colonial ethnographic gaze that shaped both British governance and Indian self-understanding during a formative period. Modern scholars approach it critically as both a valuable historical source and an artifact of colonial knowledge production.

## About Herbert Hope Risley

**Sir Herbert Hope Risley** (1851-1911) was a British colonial administrator and anthropologist who spent most of his career in India, rising to become Census Commissioner (1899-1902) and later Home Secretary to the Government of India. Educated at Oxford, Risley joined the Indian Civil Service in 1873 and served in various administrative capacities in Bengal before becoming interested in ethnography and physical anthropology.

Risley pioneered the application of anthropometric measurements—particularly nasal indices—to Indian populations, attempting to establish racial classifications and correlate physical characteristics with social hierarchy. His theories posited that caste originated from racial differences, with higher castes supposedly descended from Indo-Aryan invaders and lower castes from indigenous Dravidian or pre-Dravidian populations. These ideas, though lacking scientific validity, shaped colonial policies and census categories for decades.

His influence extended beyond ethnography to administrative policy. As Census Commissioner, Risley implemented systematic caste enumeration in the 1901 Census, codifying and reifying caste identities in ways that scholars argue fundamentally altered Indian social dynamics. He received numerous honors including knighthood, reflecting his standing within the colonial establishment.

## Historical Context and Methodology

The 1885 Ethnographic Survey of Bengal occurred during the high colonial period when British administrators sought systematic knowledge of populations they governed. The survey employed numerous enumerators who collected data on:

**Ethnographic Information**: Caste names, subdivisions, occupations, marriage customs, religious practices, social organization, and cultural traditions.

**Anthropometric Measurements**: Systematic recording of nasal indices, head measurements, stature, and skin color to construct racial classifications.

**Social Hierarchy**: Documentation of ritual status, intercaste relations, commensality rules, and pollution concepts.

**Geographic Distribution**: Mapping of where different communities lived across Bengal Presidency.

The survey's scale was unprecedented—thousands of individuals measured, hundreds of communities documented, massive amounts of data compiled. Risley personally supervised the operation, established standardized procedures, and analyzed the results through his racial classification framework.

## Structure and Content

The four volumes comprise:

### Volumes 1-2: Ethnographic Glossary
Alphabetically arranged entries for hundreds of castes and tribes, each including:
- Alternative names and subdivisions
- Traditional occupations and economic activities
- Marriage customs and kinship patterns
- Religious beliefs and ceremonial practices
- Social status and intercaste relations
- Geographic distribution
- Population statistics
- Historical references where available

Entries range from brief notices of small communities to extensive articles on major groups like Brahmins, Kayasthas, and various tribal populations.

### Volumes 3-4: Anthropometric Data
Extensive tables presenting physical measurements organized by caste, including:
- Nasal indices (ratio of nasal width to length)
- Cephalic indices (head measurements)
- Stature measurements
- Skin color classifications
- Statistical analyses correlating measurements with caste hierarchy

Risley used these data to construct a seven-fold racial classification supposedly explaining Bengal's social structure through biological difference.

## The Racial Classification Theory

Risley's central theoretical framework attempted to explain caste through race. He proposed that nasal indices demonstrated racial origins, with:

**Aryan Type**: Narrow noses, lighter skin, found predominantly in higher castes
**Dravidian Type**: Broader noses, darker skin, found in middle castes
**Mongoloid Type**: Characteristics associated with northeastern populations
**Mixed Types**: Various combinations reflecting historical intermixture

This framework suggested caste hierarchy originated from conquest and racial difference rather than occupational or ritual specialization. Risley argued that measuring noses could scientifically determine social status and racial ancestry.

Modern scholarship has thoroughly rejected these theories. Research demonstrates:
- Physical variation within castes exceeds variation between castes
- Caste is a social, not biological, phenomenon
- Endogamy has not created distinct "racial" groups
- Colonial racial theories reflected European racist ideologies rather than Indian realities
- The theory served colonial interests in portraying Indian society as naturally hierarchical

## Influence on Colonial Governance

Risley's ethnographic work directly shaped administrative policies:

**Census Operations**: The 1901 Census, supervised by Risley, systematically enumerated castes and assigned them to hierarchical categories, codifying fluid social identities into fixed categories.

**Legal Systems**: Anglo-Hindu law referenced ethnographic works like Risley's to determine "custom" and "tradition" in personal law cases.

**Educational and Employment Policies**: Caste classifications influenced access to colonial institutions and opportunities.

**Divide-and-Rule Politics**: Detailed knowledge of intercaste relations enabled British manipulation of social divisions.

**Social Engineering**: Colonial policies treated ethnographic descriptions as prescriptive rather than descriptive, enforcing supposed "traditional" practices.

## Critical Perspectives

Modern scholars recognize both the work's value and its profound problems:

**Historical Value**:
- Documents late 19th-century social organization
- Preserves information about communities whose practices have changed
- Provides baseline for studying social transformation
- Reveals colonial administrative priorities and assumptions

**Critical Problems**:
- Promotes discredited racial theories
- Treats caste as static and ancient rather than historically dynamic
- Serves colonial governance objectives
- Reifies and rigidifies fluid social categories
- Employs "scientific" methods lacking scientific validity
- Reflects and reinforces colonial power relations

**Methodological Flaws**:
- Reliance on elite informants shaped data
- Translation issues distorted understanding
- Imposed Western categories on Indian realities
- Measurement protocols lacked rigor
- Statistical analyses employed questionable assumptions

## Impact on Indian Society

Ironically, colonial ethnography like Risley's transformed the very society it claimed merely to document. By enumerating and ranking castes in census operations, colonial authorities:

- Encouraged caste-based political mobilization
- Created incentives for groups to claim higher status
- Standardized highly variable regional practices
- Produced "official" caste lists used for reservations and benefits
- Shaped how Indians understood their own social structure

Many contemporary caste identities and hierarchies reflect colonial-era codifications as much as pre-colonial practices. The "traditionalizing" of caste through ethnography paradoxically modernized it by bureaucratizing social identity.

## Legacy and Contemporary Use

Despite its theoretical bankruptcy, Risley's work continues to be consulted:

**Historical Research**: Essential source for studying 19th-century society
**Genealogical Research**: Communities trace their documented histories
**Policy Debates**: Discussions of reservation systems reference colonial ethnographies
**Postcolonial Studies**: Exemplar of colonial knowledge production and its consequences
**Anthropological History**: Shows evolution of ethnographic methods and theories

The work serves as a cautionary example of how putatively scientific research can reflect and reinforce power inequalities, shaping social realities in ways that persist long after the theoretical frameworks are discredited.

## Accessing the Work

Multiple digitized editions ensure this important historical document remains accessible for critical scholarly engagement. Researchers must approach it with awareness of its colonial context, theoretical problems, and complex legacy while recognizing its value for understanding both 19th-century Bengali society and the colonial apparatus that governed it.
