# Uttara-Rāma-Charita (Rama's Later History)

## Overview

This critical edition presents Bhavabhuti's seven-act Sanskrit drama depicting Rama's life after his coronation, focusing on the abandonment and eventual reunion with Sita. The play begins after Rama sends the pregnant Sita to exile following public accusations, continues through the birth and upbringing of their twin sons Lava and Kusha by sage Valmiki, and culminates in a reunion orchestrated by divine intervention when goddesses Ganga and Prithvi vindicate Sita's chastity. Belvalkar's 1915 Harvard Oriental Series edition provides the original Sanskrit and Prakrit text with English translation, introduction, and critical apparatus including textual variants.

## About Bhavabhuti

Bhavabhuti (fl. 8th century CE) was a Sanskrit scholar, poet, and playwright active during the reign of King Yasovarman of Kannauj. He is particularly renowned for his dramatic works exploring the karuna rasa (compassionate sentiment). His three surviving plays—Mahaviracharita, Malatimadhava, and Uttararamacarita—demonstrate profound psychological insight and poetic sophistication. The Uttararamacarita is considered his masterwork, noted for its sensitive treatment of Sita's suffering and its exploration of dharmic conflict between personal emotion and royal duty.

## About the Editor

Shripad Krishna Belvalkar (1881-1967) was an Indian Sanskrit scholar best known for his critical editions and translations of Sanskrit dramatic works. His 1915 edition of Uttararamacarita, published as Volume 21 of the Harvard Oriental Series, established standards for textual scholarship combining philological rigor with accessible translation. Belvalkar's work made classical Sanskrit drama more accessible to Western scholars while preserving the complexity of the original texts.

## Literary and Dramatic Significance

Uttararamacarita diverges from Valmiki's Ramayana by providing extensive psychological depth to characters, particularly Sita and Rama. Bhavabhuti explores the tension between Rama's role as ideal king (upholding public opinion) and his personal devotion to Sita. The play is structured in seven acts with sophisticated use of both Sanskrit and Prakrit dialogues, reflecting social hierarchies and emotional states through linguistic choices. The work has been praised for its lyrical poetry and its compassionate treatment of human suffering.

## Content and Structure

The seven acts trace:
1. Rama's internal conflict after sending Sita to exile
2. Sita's life in Valmiki's hermitage and birth of twins Lava and Kusha
3. The boys' upbringing and martial training
4. Rama's horse sacrifice (ashvamedha) where the boys capture the sacrificial horse
5. Recognition scenes and mounting dramatic tension
6. Divine intervention as goddesses testify to Sita's purity
7. Reunion of Rama and Sita, resolution through dharmic vindication
