# The Law Relating to India and the East-India Company

## Overview
Published by W. H. Allen in 1855, this official compilation collects the royal charters, acts of Parliament, and standing regulations that governed East India Company territories. It codifies rules for the civil service, military establishments, and provincial courts, assembling materials cited by lawyers and legislators in the final years of Company rule.

## Highlights
The folio prints the Regulating Act of 1773, later Charter Acts, and numerous supplementary statutes covering trade monopolies, revenue settlements, and judicial appeals to the Privy Council. Appendices reproduce model covenants for Company servants and detailed tables of sanctioned salaries, providing a working manual for administrators and legal counsel.

## Access Notes
The Internet Archive scan offers clear facsimile images and text search, enabling researchers to locate specific clauses or cross-reference legislative changes discussed during the transition to Crown administration after 1858.
