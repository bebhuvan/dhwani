description: |
  Tewari's scholarly examination of Sanskrit inscriptions represents a critical scholarly intervention in understanding linguistic evolution and cultural transmission in medieval India, specifically analyzing epigraphical sources from the Gupta and post-Gupta periods (approximately 300-1200 CE). The work meticulously explores how inscriptional evidence provides nuanced lexical insights that extend beyond traditional textual studies, revealing complex linguistic transformations across political and cultural transitions. By systematically analyzing inscriptions from multiple regions—including imperial centers like Magadha, Deccan, and peripheral kingdoms—Tewari demonstrates how these material artifacts capture linguistic variations, semantic shifts, and socio-cultural knowledge preservation mechanisms that standard literary texts often obscure. The research is particularly significant in reconstructing vocabularies of administrative, religious, and social domains during a transformative period of Indian history characterized by dynastic changes, emerging regional kingdoms, and sophisticated cultural synthesis. Tewari's methodological approach bridges epigraphical studies, historical linguistics, and cultural anthropology, offering scholars a sophisticated framework for understanding language not merely as a communicative tool but as a dynamic repository of social memory and cultural negotiation. By meticulously documenting lexical variations across different inscription types—royal charters, temple records, merchant inscriptions—the work provides unprecedented granularity in tracking linguistic drift, semantic evolution, and intercultural linguistic exchanges. For contemporary scholars of Indian intellectual history, this work remains a foundational text in understanding how language archives and transmits cultural knowledge, revealing the profound complexity of India's linguistic heritage beyond conventional textual narratives.
