## Historical Context

Published in 1871, William Wilson Hunter's "The Indian Musalmans" emerged as a pivotal scholarly examination during a critical juncture of British colonial administrative recalibration following the traumatic Indian Rebellion of 1857. As a distinguished member of the Indian Civil Service and later the first director-general of statistics for British India, Hunter undertook a nuanced analytical exploration of Muslim political loyalties within the complex colonial governance framework. The work critically interrogates the fundamental question of whether Islamic religious principles and legal traditions obligated Indian Muslims to resist British imperial rule, reflecting the profound post-rebellion anxieties surrounding religious identity, political allegiance, and colonial power dynamics. Hunter's systematic investigation delves into the ideological underpinnings of Wahabi movements and the intricate religious-political consciousness of Muslim communities across the Indian subcontinent. By meticulously examining theological, historical, and sociopolitical dimensions, the text represents a sophisticated imperial attempt to comprehend and strategically manage religious diversity within colonial administrative structures. Hunter's scholarly approach distinguished itself through empirical research and a relatively sympathetic understanding of Muslim perspectives, challenging simplistic colonial narratives about religious motivation and political resistance. The work provides critical insights into the intellectual discourse surrounding colonial governance, religious identity, and the complex negotiation of power in nineteenth-century India. Its significance extends beyond immediate colonial administrative concerns, offering a nuanced scholarly document that illuminates the intricate religious and political dynamics of a transformative period in Indian cultural and political history.

# The Indian Musalmans: Are They Bound in Conscience to Rebel Against the Queen?

## Overview

Published in August 1871, this work by William Wilson Hunter addressed a pressing question posed by Viceroy Lord Mayo on 30 May 1871: whether Indian Muslims faced religious obligations to rebel against British rule. Completed in approximately three weeks, the book emerged directly from anxieties following the 1857 Rebellion and the contemporaneous Wahabi trials conducted between 1863 and 1871 in Ambala, Patna, Rajmahal, and Malda. Hunter's inquiry reflected British concerns about Muslim political loyalty at a moment when colonial authorities were prosecuting alleged Wahabi conspirators and attempting to dismantle the organizational networks that had supported Sayyid Ahmad Barelvi's frontier jihad movement, which had operated from Sithana in the north-western tribal belt since 1826 before his death at Balakot in 1831.

Hunter's answer to the titular question was unequivocal: he argued that Muslims were religiously obligated to rebel and therefore constituted an inherent threat to the Empire. The work consists of four chapters, with the first three devoted to analyzing the Indian Wahabi movement and its aftermath, particularly in Bengal, while the final chapter examines Muslim grievances and proposes modifications to state education systems to attract Muslims toward official employment and away from disloyalty. The book was immediately influential in policy circles, shaping British administrative approaches to Muslim communities, though it provoked swift rebuttal from Muslim intellectuals who contested both its theological interpretations and its characterization of Muslim political attitudes.

## About the Author — W. W. Hunter

William Wilson Hunter (15 July 1840 – 6 February 1900) was a Scottish civil servant and statistical surveyor whose career exemplified Victorian colonial knowledge production. Born in Glasgow, Hunter studied at the University of Glasgow, Paris, and Bonn, acquiring Sanskrit expertise before joining the Indian Civil Service in 1862, ranking first in the final examination. In 1869, Governor-General Lord Mayo tasked him with developing a comprehensive statistical survey of India, consolidating disparate local gazetteers into unified documentation. Hunter supervised the twenty-volume *A Statistical Account of Bengal* (1875–1877) and similar documentation for Assam (two volumes, 1879). As Director-General of Statistics to the Government of India, Hunter's most significant achievement was editing *The Imperial Gazetteer of India*, which first appeared in nine volumes in 1881, derived from 128 volumes of district-level statistical accounts, with subsequent editions expanding to fourteen volumes (1885–1887) and eventually twenty-six volumes (1908), published posthumously. Hunter served as vice-chancellor of the University of Calcutta (1886), presided over the 1882 Commission on Indian Education, and retired in 1887 as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India (KCSI). Historian S. C. Mittal characterized Hunter as representing "the official mind of the bureaucratic Victorian historians in India."

## The Work

**Scope and Methodology:**

Hunter's investigation centered on Islamic jurisprudential concepts of territorial classification—specifically whether British India constituted *dar al-Islam* (abode of Islam) or *dar al-harb* (abode of war)—and the implications for religious obligations regarding jihad. These categories, developed by early Islamic jurists approximately a century after Muhammad to address ongoing Muslim conquests, distinguished territories under Islamic sovereignty from those ruled by non-Muslims. Hunter collected and analyzed fatwas issued by various ulema to demonstrate theological positions on these questions. A fatwa dated 17 July 1870, signed by Maulavi Ali Muhammad, Maulavi Abdul Hai, Maulavi Fazlullah, Muhammad Naim, and Maulavi Rahmatullah of Lucknow, along with Maulavi Qutb-ud-Din of Delhi and Maulavi Lutfullah of Rampur, classified India as *dar al-harb* but nevertheless ruled armed struggle unlawful, reasoning that "the Musalmans here are protected by Christians, and there is no Jihad in a country where protection is afforded." A second fatwa by Maulavi Karamat Ali of the Calcutta Muhammadan Society reached the same conclusion from the opposite premise, classifying India as *dar al-Islam* and asserting that "jihad can by no means be lawfully made in Dar-ul-Islam," with Muslims bound to assist authorities against rebels.

Hunter cited earlier rulings such as that of Abd al-Hayy (d. 1828), who declared India "the country of the Enemy" because "no recourse is made to our holy law." Hunter's methodology involved selective presentation of these theological opinions to support his thesis of inherent Muslim disloyalty, despite the fatwas' actual conclusions rejecting religious obligations for rebellion. The work examined Muslim grievances primarily through the lens of educational and employment disadvantages, particularly in the Bengal Presidency, arguing that Muslims' exclusion from official positions fostered resentment and political alienation. Hunter's recommendations focused on educational reforms designed to make Muslims more suitable for government service and thereby "weaning them away from the path of disloyalty."

**Historical Context:**

The book emerged from the convergence of multiple colonial anxieties. The 1857 Rebellion had shattered British confidence, and subsequent decades witnessed intensive British prosecution of the Wahabi movement, which authorities viewed as a continuing threat to imperial stability. The trials of the 1860s—particularly the Patna proceedings covered daily by *The Indian Daily News* from 3 June to 5 August 1871—prosecuted prominent Wahabi leaders and sought to dismantle the movement's organizational infrastructure. By 1870, British forces had largely crushed the Wahabi movement's operational capacity, yet concerns about Muslim political loyalty persisted. Hunter's work functioned as both retrospective analysis and prospective policy guidance, attempting to provide the colonial administration with a framework for understanding and managing Muslim political consciousness in the post-rebellion era.

## Significance

**Contemporary Reception:**

Lord Mayo expressed satisfaction with Hunter's work, which influenced British administrative policies toward Muslim communities. However, the book provoked immediate criticism from Muslim intellectuals. Sir Syed Ahmad Khan (1817-1898) published a comprehensive rebuttal in 1872, *Review on Dr. Hunter's Indian Musalmans: Are They Bound in Conscience to Rebel Against the Queen?*, proceeding point-by-point through Hunter's arguments and challenging his understanding of Islamic theology, Wahabi movements, and Muslim political consciousness. Khan's defensive approach reflected the political pressures facing Muslim communities in the aftermath of 1857, where they were held uniquely accountable for rebellion. Other Muslim modernists during the 1880s, including Karamat Ali Jawnpuri and Ubayd-Allah Ubaydi Suhrawardi, similarly denied that India constituted *dar al-harb*, contesting Hunter's theological framework.

**Later Assessment:**

Subsequent scholarship has identified Hunter as a progenitor of Muslim separatism and linked his work to deliberate colonial divide-and-rule policies. Scholars including Anil Seal in *The Emergence of Indian Nationalism* (1968) and Peter Hardy in *The Muslims of British India* (1972) examined how Hunter's characterization of Muslims as a distinct political problem contributed to communal categorization that culminated in partition. One critic observed that the book, "compiled in three weeks on Mayo's orders, has been the source of many of the polemics launched on behalf of the two-nation theory." Recent scholarship has demonstrated from official records that Muslims in provinces outside Bengal did not experience the educational and employment disadvantages Hunter emphasized, suggesting his Bengal-specific observations were generalized inappropriately. The work exemplifies how colonial knowledge production rendered Muslims a minoritized and racialized community, distinctively accountable for 1857's violence and requiring special administrative management as a problem to be solved by the ruling elite.

**Value for Researchers:**

Despite or because of its methodological flaws and political motivations, *The Indian Musalmans* remains valuable for understanding colonial-Muslim relations in nineteenth-century India. The work documents British administrative anxieties, preserves fatwas that illuminate ulema positions on territorial classification and political obligations under colonial rule, and demonstrates how Islamic jurisprudential debates were appropriated for colonial policy purposes. The text reveals the mechanisms through which religious discourse was manipulated to construct political categories, and the immediate rebuttals it provoked—particularly Syed Ahmad Khan's detailed response—illustrate Muslim intellectual engagement with colonial characterizations. For scholars of colonialism, Islamic thought, South Asian history, and the genealogy of communal politics, Hunter's work provides essential evidence of how British authorities conceptualized Muslim political identity and how these conceptualizations shaped subsequent administrative practices and political trajectories.
