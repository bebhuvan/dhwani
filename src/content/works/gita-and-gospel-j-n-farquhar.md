  John Nicol Farquhar's "Gita and Gospel" (1903) represents a pioneering work in comparative religious studies, examining the Bhagavad Gita alongside the Christian Gospels and classical Western ethical texts during a pivotal period in interfaith dialogue. Farquhar (1861-1929), a Scottish educational missionary and orientalist working in colonial India, developed his influential "fulfillment theology" proposing that Christianity represents the culmination or fulfillment of Hinduism's highest spiritual aspirations—a theological framework that profoundly shaped Protestant missionary strategy and Hindu-Christian encounter throughout the early twentieth century. The work emerged from Farquhar's deep engagement with Hindu philosophical texts and his conviction that Christianity could be presented not as the negation but as the perfection of Hindu spiritual seeking. Rather than dismissing Hindu scriptures as pagan error, Farquhar approached the Bhagavad Gita as genuine religious wisdom containing profound ethical and spiritual insights, yet arguing that these insights find their ultimate expression in Jesus Christ's life and teachings. His comparative methodology juxtaposes the Gita's teachings—particularly concerning dharma (righteous duty), karma yoga (path of selfless action), and devotion to Krishna—with parallel concepts in the Christian Gospels, Plato's Republic, the Hebrew prophets, and Virgil's Fourth Eclogue, constructing a narrative of progressive religious revelation culminating in Christ. This approach reflected broader late nineteenth-century liberal Protestant efforts to engage non-Christian religions sympathetically while maintaining Christian theological superiority, navigating between fundamentalist rejection of other traditions and relativist equality of all religions. Farquhar's work significantly influenced Christian missionary education in India, informing strategies at institutions like the YMCA where he worked, and shaped academic approaches to comparative religion by demonstrating sophisticated engagement with Asian texts rather than superficial dismissal. The book illuminates the complex dynamics of colonial religious encounter, where missionaries simultaneously studied Hindu texts seriously, appreciated their spiritual depth, and deployed that understanding toward conversion aims. Contemporary readers may find Farquhar's fulfillment theology problematic in its assumption of Christian superiority, yet the work remains historically significant for documenting early interfaith comparative scholarship and demonstrating how religious traditions negotiated modernity, colonialism, and cross-cultural contact during a transformative historical period.

# Gita and Gospel

## Overview

Published in 1903, John Nicol Farquhar's "Gita and Gospel" emerged during a critical period in Christian missionary engagement with Hindu philosophical traditions. The work represents an early systematic attempt at comparative religious analysis, examining the Bhagavad Gita's ethical and spiritual teachings alongside the Christian Gospels, Plato's conception of the just man, the Hebrew Servant of Jehovah, and Virgil's prophecies of a golden age. Farquhar's comparative framework sought to demonstrate both the genuine spiritual insights within Hindu scripture and their alleged fulfillment or completion in Christ's life and teachings.

The book's structure reflects Farquhar's theological agenda: beginning with sympathetic exposition of the Gita's teachings, then presenting parallel Western ethical and religious ideals from classical and biblical sources, and culminating in Jesus as the supreme embodiment of these universal spiritual aspirations. This progression implicitly argues that the Gita's highest ideals—selfless action, devotion to the divine, transcendence of ego—find their perfect realization in Christ's incarnation, sacrificial death, and resurrection.

Farquhar's approach represented a significant departure from earlier missionary attitudes that dismissed Hindu texts as idolatrous error or demonic deception. Instead, he proposed "fulfillment theology"—the idea that non-Christian religions contain genuine divine revelation or human spiritual seeking that Christianity fulfills rather than negates. This theological framework, influenced by liberal Protestant thought and evolutionary models of religious development, shaped missionary education and strategy in India for decades, informing institutions like the YMCA, Christian colleges, and theological seminaries where Farquhar worked.

## About J. N. Farquhar (1861-1929)

John Nicol Farquhar was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, in 1861, educated at Aberdeen Grammar School and the University of Aberdeen, and initially prepared for Presbyterian ministry before his interests shifted toward educational missions. In 1891, he arrived in India under the auspices of the London Missionary Society, beginning a nearly four-decade engagement with Indian religious traditions, Christian missionary work, and academic scholarship.

Farquhar's early years in India involved educational mission work, teaching at missionary institutions and observing the challenges of Christian evangelism in a culture with sophisticated philosophical and religious traditions. Unlike many missionaries who remained culturally isolated, Farquhar immersed himself in Sanskrit literature, Hindu philosophy, and contemporary Indian religious movements. He studied the Bhagavad Gita, Upanishads, and other classical texts, developed relationships with Hindu scholars and reformers, and observed the intellectual ferment of the Bengal Renaissance and Hindu reform movements like the Brahmo Samaj and Arya Samaj.

In 1902, Farquhar joined the YMCA in India, serving as Literary Secretary and later National General Secretary. This role enabled him to develop educational and publishing programs aimed at educated young Indian men, producing literature engaging Hindu philosophical traditions from Christian perspectives. His YMCA work emphasized respectful engagement with Hinduism rather than confrontational denunciation, attempting to demonstrate Christianity's intellectual and spiritual superiority through comparative analysis rather than polemic.

Farquhar's scholarly reputation grew through publications including "Modern Religious Movements in India" (1915), which analyzed Hindu reform movements, neo-Vedanta, and other contemporary religious developments with remarkable scholarly sophistication. His magnum opus, "An Outline of the Religious Literature of India" (1920), provided comprehensive survey of Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain textual traditions organized historically and thematically—a work that remained a standard reference for decades. These publications demonstrated Farquhar's command of Sanskrit sources, his historical approach to Indian religions, and his ability to present complex materials systematically.

In 1923, Farquhar returned to Britain, becoming Professor of Comparative Religion at the University of Manchester—one of the first academic positions in comparative religion in Britain. This appointment reflected recognition of both his scholarly expertise and the emerging academic respectability of religious studies as a field distinct from theology. He continued publishing on Indian religions until his death in 1929, contributing significantly to both missionary thought and academic religious studies.

Farquhar's legacy remains contested. Sympathetic interpreters credit him with pioneering respectful engagement with Hindu traditions, encouraging missionaries to study Indian culture seriously, and demonstrating that Christianity could engage rather than simply condemn other religions. Critics argue that his fulfillment theology, despite its comparative sophistication, ultimately served colonial and missionary agendas by appropriating Hindu spiritual achievements while insisting on Christian superiority. His work illuminates how liberal Protestant missions navigated between respecting non-Christian religions and maintaining exclusivist theological claims during colonialism's height.

## The Bhagavad Gita: Context and Significance

The Bhagavad Gita ("Song of the Lord"), composed approximately 200 BCE-200 CE, forms a 700-verse section of the Indian epic Mahabharata, presenting a dialogue between the warrior prince Arjuna and his charioteer Krishna (revealed as divine incarnation) on the Kurukshetra battlefield. As Arjuna hesitates to fight a war against relatives and teachers, Krishna instructs him on duty (dharma), action (karma), devotion (bhakti), and knowledge (jnana), synthesizing diverse Hindu philosophical traditions into an influential spiritual teaching.

The Gita became Hinduism's most widely studied text, functioning as accessible introduction to Hindu philosophy for both traditional practitioners and modern seekers. Its teachings on performing duty without attachment to results (nishkama karma), its integration of contemplative knowledge with active engagement, and its emphasis on devotion to a personal deity made it appeal across Hindu sectarian divisions. Modern Hindu reformers including Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Mahatma Gandhi, Sri Aurobindo, and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan wrote extensive commentaries interpreting the Gita for contemporary contexts, often emphasizing its ethical universalism and philosophical sophistication.

By the early twentieth century, the Gita had achieved prominence beyond Hindu communities. Transcendentalists including Emerson and Thoreau engaged its teachings; Theosophists promoted it as universal wisdom; and scholars like Edwin Arnold (author of "The Song Celestial," 1885) translated it for Western audiences. This broader circulation made the Gita an obvious text for Christian comparative engagement, representing Hinduism's highest ethical and spiritual teachings in accessible form.

## Structure and Comparative Methodology

Farquhar organized "Gita and Gospel" into six chapters plus an appendix, constructing a comparative narrative highlighting parallels and progressions:

**Chapter 1: "What is the Bhagavadgītā?"** provides historical and literary context for the Gita, summarizing its narrative frame, philosophical content, and significance within Hindu tradition. Farquhar presents the text sympathetically, acknowledging its spiritual depth and ethical sophistication while noting elements he finds problematic from Christian perspectives—particularly its teaching that disciplined action (karma yoga) can achieve liberation without necessarily requiring faith in Christ.

**Chapter 2: "Plato's Just Man"** examines Plato's Republic, particularly Book II's description of the perfectly just man who faces persecution yet maintains virtue. Farquhar draws parallels between Plato's ideal and the Gita's teaching of detached action according to dharma regardless of consequences. Both, he argues, articulate universal ethical intuitions about virtue pursued for its own sake rather than external reward—intuitions that find fulfillment in Christ's sinless life and undeserved suffering.

**Chapter 3: "The Servant of Jehovah"** analyzes Isaiah's Suffering Servant passages (particularly Isaiah 42, 49, 52-53), presenting them as Hebrew prophecy of the messiah who suffers redemptively for humanity. Farquhar argues that while the Gita teaches selfless action for duty's sake, the Suffering Servant reveals suffering undertaken voluntarily for others' salvation—a higher ethical ideal finding fulfillment in Christ's sacrificial death.

**Chapter 4: "Virgil's New Age of Justice and Peace"** examines Virgil's Fourth Eclogue, which prophesies a child's birth ushering in a golden age. Medieval Christians interpreted this as messianic prophecy, and Farquhar employs it to demonstrate universal longing for divine intervention to establish righteousness—again fulfilled in Christ's incarnation.

**Chapter 5: "Jesus of Nazareth"** presents Christ as the culmination of ethical and spiritual ideals articulated in the Gita, Plato, Isaiah, and Virgil. Farquhar argues that Jesus embodies perfect detachment from self-interest (the Gita's ideal), perfect justice (Plato's ideal), redemptive suffering (Isaiah's ideal), and inaugurates God's kingdom (Virgil's ideal), while transcending these through his divine nature, atoning death, and resurrection.

**Chapter 6: "Conclusion"** synthesizes the comparative analysis, arguing that Christianity fulfills rather than contradicts Hinduism's highest aspirations. Farquhar acknowledges genuine spiritual insight in the Gita while asserting that Christ provides what the Gita cannot—not just ethical teaching but transforming divine grace, not just philosophical principles but personal relationship with God, not just wisdom about reality but redemption from sin and death.

**Appendix: "Neo-Krishna Literature"** examines modern devotional movements emphasizing Krishna bhakti (devotion), particularly as influenced by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu's fifteenth-century movement. Farquhar analyzes how these traditions emphasize passionate love for Krishna, drawing parallels with Christian devotion to Christ while arguing that Krishna remains mythological rather than historical, lacking Christ's redemptive work.

## Theological Framework: Fulfillment Theology

Farquhar's comparative approach rested on fulfillment theology, which proposed that non-Christian religions represent humanity's sincere spiritual seeking or partial divine revelation that Christianity completes. This framework appeared in various forms throughout Christian history but gained systematic articulation among liberal Protestant missionaries encountering sophisticated Asian religions in the late nineteenth century.

Fulfillment theology occupied a middle position between two extremes: fundamentalist exclusivism that dismissed all non-Christian religions as satanic deception or human delusion, and liberal relativism that viewed all religions as equally valid paths to the same ultimate reality. Fulfillment theologians argued that non-Christian traditions contain genuine religious truth and moral beauty—evidence of universal human spiritual nature or divine self-revelation beyond biblical contexts—yet remain incomplete, finding their culmination in Christ's unique incarnation and redemptive work.

This approach offered several strategic advantages for missionaries: it enabled respectful engagement with Hindu texts and traditions, demonstrating cultural sensitivity; it acknowledged genuine spirituality among non-Christians, avoiding offensive dismissal of their religious experiences; it positioned Christianity as building upon rather than demolishing Hindu achievements, making conversion appear as fulfillment rather than betrayal of one's heritage; and it responded to educated Indians who questioned why they should abandon sophisticated philosophical traditions for what appeared to be foreign religion.

Critics, both Christian and non-Christian, challenged fulfillment theology on multiple grounds. Conservative Christians argued it compromised the gospel's uniqueness and the necessity of faith in Christ, dangerously suggesting non-Christian religions might contain salvific knowledge. Hindu intellectuals rejected the framework as patronizing appropriation disguising Christian imperialism—superficially honoring Hinduism while ultimately asserting its inadequacy and need for supersession. Postcolonial scholars interpret fulfillment theology as sophisticated colonial discourse that acknowledged indigenous culture's value while maintaining Western/Christian superiority, facilitating colonial cultural domination through apparent respect rather than crude dismissal.

## Hindu Responses and Counter-Arguments

Educated Hindu intellectuals developed sophisticated responses to Farquhar's fulfillment theology and similar Christian comparative approaches. These responses took several forms:

**Reversal of the Fulfillment Framework**: Hindu modernists like Vivekananda argued that Christianity represented preliminary ethical teaching that Vedanta philosophy fulfilled through superior metaphysical knowledge. Christianity's dualistic theology (God separate from souls) represents an early stage transcended by Advaita Vedanta's non-dualistic realization of ultimate unity.

**Assertion of Hinduism's Comprehensiveness**: Hindu apologists argued that Hinduism already contained whatever valid insights Christianity offered—ethical teaching, devotional practice, mystical experience, philosophical rigor—plus sophisticated metaphysics, contemplative techniques, and theological diversity that Christianity lacked. Why adopt a limited foreign tradition when one's own offered comprehensive spiritual resources?

**Historical and Theological Critique**: Hindu scholars questioned Christianity's historical claims (particularly regarding miracles and resurrection), challenged doctrines like original sin and vicarious atonement as morally problematic, and argued that Christian exclusivism contradicted claims about divine love. The Gita's teaching of multiple paths to the divine appeared more inclusive and philosophically defensible than Christian insistence on salvation through Christ alone.

**Anti-Colonial Resistance**: During independence movements, Hindu nationalism increasingly rejected Christian missionary activity as cultural imperialism allied with British colonialism. Figures like Mahatma Gandhi appreciated Jesus' ethical teachings while firmly rejecting missionary efforts to convert Hindus, arguing that each should deepen their own tradition rather than abandon it for another.

**Development of Comparative Hinduism**: Hindu teachers including Vivekananda, Radhakrishnan, and others developed their own comparative approaches, arguing for Vedanta's universal philosophy capable of accommodating Christian insights while transcending Christian limitations. This "neo-Vedanta" became influential globally, presenting Hinduism as the universal religion toward which all traditions evolve.

These Hindu responses demonstrated that comparative religious discourse operated within power dynamics shaped by colonialism, with both missionaries and Hindu reformers deploying scholarship, textual interpretation, and theological argument to advance competing visions of religious truth and cultural authority.

## Historical Significance and Legacy

"Gita and Gospel" represents an important document in the history of Hindu-Christian encounter, interfaith dialogue, and comparative religious studies. Its significance extends across several domains:

**Missionary Strategy**: The work exemplifies liberal Protestant missions' educational approach in early twentieth-century India, emphasizing cultural engagement over confrontational evangelism. Farquhar's methodology influenced missionary education at Christian colleges, YMCA programs, and theological institutions, encouraging missionaries to study Hindu texts seriously and engage educated Indians through intellectual discussion rather than mass evangelism.

**Comparative Religious Studies**: As an early systematic comparative analysis, the work contributed to establishing comparative religion as academic field. While motivated by theological agenda, Farquhar's close reading of texts from multiple traditions and attention to parallel ethical and spiritual concerns modeled scholarly approaches that would develop in secular academic contexts.

**Colonial Religious Encounter**: The work illuminates how religious traditions negotiated colonialism, with British missionaries studying Indian traditions to facilitate conversion, Hindu reformers responding by asserting their tradition's equality or superiority, and complex cultural exchanges occurring despite unequal power relations. Farquhar's career demonstrates how individuals could simultaneously contribute to colonial cultural projects and genuine scholarly understanding of non-Western traditions.

**Interfaith Dialogue Precedents**: While fulfillment theology's assumption of Christian superiority contradicts contemporary interfaith dialogue's emphasis on mutual respect and learning, Farquhar's willingness to engage Hindu texts seriously and acknowledge their spiritual value represented progress beyond cruder dismissal. Contemporary interfaith dialogue developed partly through critiquing and moving beyond frameworks like Farquhar's, demonstrating both continuity and rupture with earlier comparative approaches.

**Academic and Theological Debates**: Farquhar's work contributed to ongoing debates about religious truth, the relationship between religions, and appropriate Christian attitudes toward non-Christian traditions—debates that continue in theology, religious studies, and philosophy of religion. His fulfillment theology represents one historical solution to tensions between religious particularity and universality, Christian exclusivism and appreciation for other traditions' insights.

## Contemporary Relevance and Critical Assessment

From contemporary perspectives, "Gita and Gospel" reveals both insights and limitations characteristic of its historical moment. Modern readers can appreciate Farquhar's genuine engagement with Hindu philosophy, his careful textual analysis, and his attempt to find common ground between traditions, while recognizing problematic aspects of his theological framework and colonial context.

**Positive Contributions**: Farquhar demonstrated that serious Christian engagement with Hindu texts was possible and productive; he modeled close reading and comparative analysis that influenced subsequent scholarship; and he contributed to making the Bhagavad Gita more widely known among English-speaking audiences, even if his interpretive framework was contested.

**Limitations and Critiques**: The fulfillment theology framework assumes Christian superiority in ways contemporary interfaith dialogue rejects; the work operates within colonial power structures that privileged Christian perspectives; Farquhar's interpretations sometimes read Christian concepts into Hindu texts or minimize differences to construct artificial parallels; and the work's evangelistic agenda compromises scholarly objectivity.

**Historical Value**: Despite limitations, the work remains valuable for understanding early twentieth-century Christian-Hindu encounter, the development of comparative religious studies, and how religious traditions engage each other across cultural and theological differences. It documents a specific historical moment in interfaith relations, showing both progress beyond crude religious dismissal and ongoing challenges in achieving genuine mutual understanding and respect.

Contemporary scholars and religious practitioners can engage Farquhar's work critically, appreciating its historical significance and genuine scholarly contributions while questioning its theological assumptions and colonial context. The work reminds us that interfaith engagement always occurs within specific historical, political, and cultural contexts that shape both possibilities and limitations for cross-religious understanding.
