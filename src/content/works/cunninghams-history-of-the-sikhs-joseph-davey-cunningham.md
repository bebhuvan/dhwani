# Cunningham’s History of the Sikhs

## Overview
An engineer in the East India Company army, Cunningham spent years in the Punjab and at the Lahore Darbar. His 1853 study offers one of the earliest English-language accounts grounded in Punjabi chronicles, tracing how the ten Sikh Gurus, the Misls, and Maharaja Ranjit Singh forged a regional state before British annexation in 1849.

## Highlights
The narrative sets doctrinal developments alongside military campaigns, including detailed descriptions of the Anglo-Sikh wars, diplomatic missions to Kabul, and the administrative reforms of Ranjit Singh. Garrett’s later editorial apparatus supplies additional footnotes and corrections from archival material uncovered after Cunningham’s death.

## Access Notes
The Internet Archive edition presents clear scans and searchable text, making it easy to follow Cunningham’s extensive footnotes and to consult the appended genealogical tables of Sikh chiefs.
