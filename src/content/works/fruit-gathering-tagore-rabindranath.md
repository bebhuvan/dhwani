description: Fruit-Gathering is a collection of 86 lyrical poems by Rabindranath Tagore,
  published by Macmillan in New York in 1916. This work represents Tagore's translation
  and adaptation of verses from multiple Bengali collections, including Gitimala,
  Gitali, Utsarga, Kheya, Naivedya, and Gitanjali. More than fifty of the poems are
  explicitly religious in character, making this one of Tagore's most overtly spiritual
  English collections. The title itself—suggesting the gathering of fruits—serves
  as a metaphor for the spiritual harvest of a life devoted to contemplation and devotion.
  Tagore uses the imagery of fruits and flowers throughout the collection to represent
  moral and spiritual principles, particularly his adoration of the Creator and his
  understanding of the relationship between the human soul and the divine.

Written during the period following Tagore's Nobel Prize triumph with Gitanjali, Fruit-Gathering continues and deepens the mystical themes that had captivated Western readers. The poems explore the fundamental relationship between God and humanity, between the atom and the cosmos, presenting a vision of reality in which all dualities ultimately dissolve into unity. This philosophical perspective, rooted in Vedantic thought, treats the individual soul as a manifestation of the universal divine consciousness. Tagore's poetry in this collection moves between intimate devotional expressions and cosmic philosophical meditations, often within the same poem. The verses reflect his lifelong spiritual journey, influenced by the Upanishads, the Baul mystical tradition of Bengal, and his own profound mystical experiences.

The collection demonstrates Tagore's mastery of English as a literary medium while preserving the essential spirit of Bengali devotional poetry. His translation process was not mere linguistic conversion but a creative reimagining that sought to convey to Western readers the emotional and spiritual essence of the originals. The poems frequently address the divine in the second person, creating an intimacy and directness characteristic of bhakti devotional poetry. Nature imagery—drawn from the Bengali landscape of rivers, monsoons, seasons, and village life—becomes a vehicle for spiritual insight. The cyclic patterns of nature—the coming of spring, the ripening of fruit, the flowing of rivers—mirror the soul's journey toward spiritual fulfillment and union with the divine.

Fruit-Gathering explores the contrasts and paradoxes inherent in spiritual life: joy and sorrow, abundance and renunciation, the search for the divine and the discovery that the divine is already present. These tensions, rather than being resolved, are embraced as essential aspects of the spiritual journey. The collection resonates with a sense of longing—the soul's yearning for the infinite—while simultaneously expressing the joy of divine presence in everyday life. Tagore's vision, influenced by his Brahmo Samaj heritage, emphasizes direct spiritual experience over ritual, love over doctrine, and the unity of all religions in their essential spiritual core.

Published in 1916 during the devastation of World War I, Fruit-Gathering offered readers a vision of transcendence and spiritual beauty in a world torn by violence and nationalism. The poems speak to universal human experiences of love, loss, longing, and the search for meaning, making them accessible across cultural and religious boundaries. Tagore's voice in this collection is that of a spiritual teacher who speaks not from dogmatic certainty but from personal experience and profound contemplation. The fruits he offers are the insights gained from a life devoted to poetry, spirituality, and service to humanity—a harvest he shares generously with all who seek spiritual nourishment.
