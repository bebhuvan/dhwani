# Indigo and Its Enemies

## Overview
Issued under the pseudonym “Delta,” this tract responds to the Indigo Commission and Bengali peasant protests that erupted in 1859–60. The author marshals planter testimonies, revenue reports, and comparative pricing data to rebut charges that European indigo factories relied on violence and fraudulent contracts.

## Highlights
The pamphlet critiques Lieutenant-Governor John Peter Grant’s interim regulations, surveys export statistics from Calcutta, and quotes planter petitions arguing that advances to ryots were voluntary. It also disputes missionary accounts supporting peasant resistance, providing a revealing counterpoint to nationalist narratives of the Indigo Revolt.

## Access Notes
The Internet Archive copy includes searchable text and appendices reproducing official circulars and newspaper correspondence, giving researchers direct access to planter rhetoric during the crisis.
