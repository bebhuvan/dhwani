## Historical Context

During the mid-19th century, the Bengal Indigo Revolt represented a critical moment of agricultural resistance and colonial economic conflict, and this pamphlet emerges as a pivotal documentary text illuminating the complex tensions between British colonial planters and Bengali peasants. Published anonymously under the pseudonym "Delta" in London in 1861, the work provides a nuanced colonial perspective on the widespread agrarian unrest that characterized the Indigo Revolt of 1859-1860. The text critically analyzes the agricultural policies implemented by Lieutenant-Governor John Peter Grant and challenges contemporary allegations of systematic coercion by European indigo planters against indigenous cultivators. Situated within the broader narrative of colonial economic exploitation, the pamphlet represents an important historical document that reveals the intricate power dynamics between colonial administrators, plantation owners, and rural Bengali communities. The work's significance extends beyond its immediate historical moment, offering scholars crucial insights into the mechanisms of agricultural colonialism, contractual manipulation, and resistance strategies employed by marginalized peasant populations. By presenting a detailed examination of the indigo cultivation system, the text illuminates the economic structures that fundamentally transformed agrarian relations in Bengal, demonstrating how colonial economic policies disrupted traditional agricultural practices and precipitated significant social transformations. As a primary source document, "Indigo and Its Enemies" provides critical historiographical evidence for understanding the complex interactions between colonial economic imperatives, indigenous agricultural labor, and emerging forms of resistance in 19th-century India, making it an essential text for comprehending the deeper structures of colonial economic exploitation and indigenous agency.

# Indigo and Its Enemies

## Overview
Issued under the pseudonym “Delta,” this tract responds to the Indigo Commission and Bengali peasant protests that erupted in 1859–60. The author marshals planter testimonies, revenue reports, and comparative pricing data to rebut charges that European indigo factories relied on violence and fraudulent contracts.

## Highlights
The pamphlet critiques Lieutenant-Governor John Peter Grant’s interim regulations, surveys export statistics from Calcutta, and quotes planter petitions arguing that advances to ryots were voluntary. It also disputes missionary accounts supporting peasant resistance, providing a revealing counterpoint to nationalist narratives of the Indigo Revolt.
