  The Sufism of the Rubáiyát by Norton F. W. Hazeldine represents a profound reinterpretation of Omar Khayyam's celebrated quatrains through the lens of Islamic mysticism, challenging the dominant secular reading popularized by Edward FitzGerald's Victorian translation. Published in the early 20th century, this interpretive study emerged during a period of renewed scholarly interest in Sufism and Persian literary traditions, offering a sophisticated analysis of the Rubáiyát's spiritual dimensions that had been largely overlooked by Western audiences. Hazeldine systematically argues that Khayyam's seemingly hedonistic verses about wine, love, and mortality actually encode esoteric Sufi teachings about divine union, spiritual intoxication, and the transcendence of worldly illusion. The work meticulously examines how Persian mystical poetry tradition employs symbolic language—where wine represents divine ecstasy, the tavern signifies the spiritual assembly, and the beloved embodies the divine presence—revealing layers of meaning that transform apparently materialistic verses into profound metaphysical meditations. This reinterpretation holds particular significance for understanding Indo-Iranian cultural exchange, as Sufi philosophical traditions profoundly influenced the Indian subcontinent through centuries of Persian literary and religious dissemination, particularly during the Mughal period and through the widespread circulation of Persian poetry across South Asian literary circles. By situating Khayyam within the broader Sufi poetic tradition that includes figures like Rumi, Hafiz, and Attar, Hazeldine illuminates the sophisticated theological and philosophical frameworks that connected Persian and Indian mystical thought, demonstrating how Persian poetic forms became vehicles for spiritual teaching across both regions. The work contributes significantly to comparative religious studies and cross-cultural literary analysis, revealing the complex interpretive challenges inherent in translating mystical poetry across linguistic and cultural boundaries, while documenting the rich intellectual tradition that linked Persian Sufism with Indian spiritual thought through shared poetic vocabulary, mystical concepts, and philosophical frameworks that transcended geographical and political boundaries.
