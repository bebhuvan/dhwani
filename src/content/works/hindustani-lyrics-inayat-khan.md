description: |
  Urdu poetry collection published 1919 by the Sufi Publishing Society in London, presenting translations of works by prominent poets including Mirza Ghalib, Amir, and Zafar, rendered into English by Inayat Khan (1882-1927) and Jessie Duncan Westbrook. Inayat Khan, renowned as a pioneering teacher of Sufism in the West, brought exceptional qualifications: born into a noble Mughal family in Baroda, his maternal grandfather was Maula Bakhsh, celebrated Hindustani classical musician known as "the Beethoven of India." Inayat Khan became an accomplished professor of musicology, singer, and master of the sarasvati vina before sharing Sufi wisdom with Western audiences. The translations preserve spiritual depth and emotional intensity while making verses accessible to readers unfamiliar with Islamic mystical tradition. The collection explores central themes of Urdu ghazal poetry—divine love expressed through romantic metaphor, spiritual yearning as earthly desire, pain of separation from the Beloved (both human and divine), and ecstatic surrender in mystical union. Within Sufi frameworks, the human beloved reflects divine beauty, romantic longing transforms into spiritual aspiration. Translations of Ghalib are particularly significant, as Mirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib (1797-1869) represents the pinnacle of Urdu poetic achievement combining philosophical depth, emotional complexity, and linguistic virtuosity. Published during growing Western interest in Eastern spirituality, promoted through Inayat Khan's establishment of the Sufi Order in London (1914), the work served aesthetic and pedagogical purposes—introducing beautiful poetry while conveying Sufi concepts of love, devotion, and direct experiential knowledge of divine reality.
