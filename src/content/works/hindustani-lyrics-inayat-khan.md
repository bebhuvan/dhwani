  This exquisite collection of Urdu poetry rendered into English represents a significant early twentieth-century effort to introduce Western audiences to the sophisticated literary and spiritual traditions of Hindustani verse. Published in 1919 by the Sufi Publishing Society in London, the anthology presents translations of works by prominent Urdu poets including Mirza Ghalib, Amir, and Zafar, with English renderings by Inayat Khan (1882-1927) and Jessie Duncan Westbrook. Inayat Khan, who would become renowned as a pioneering teacher of Sufism in the West, brought exceptional qualifications to this literary project. Born into a noble Mughal family in Baroda, his maternal grandfather was Maula Bakhsh, the celebrated Hindustani classical musician known as "the Beethoven of India." Inayat Khan inherited this musical and poetic legacy, becoming an accomplished professor of musicology, singer, and master of the sarasvati vina before embarking on his mission to share Sufi wisdom with Western audiences. His collaboration with Jessie Duncan Westbrook produced translations that sought to preserve the spiritual depth and emotional intensity of the original Urdu while making these verses accessible to English readers unfamiliar with the Islamic mystical tradition. The collection explores central themes of Urdu ghazal poetry—divine love expressed through romantic metaphor, spiritual yearning articulated as earthly desire, the pain of separation from the Beloved (representing both human beloved and divine reality), and the ecstatic surrender of the individual self in mystical union. Within Sufi philosophical frameworks, the human beloved becomes a manifestation or reflection of divine beauty, and romantic longing transforms into spiritual aspiration. The anthology includes verses that exemplify the ghazal's sophisticated use of conventional symbols—the nightingale (representing the lover/devotee), the rose (the beloved/divine), wine (spiritual intoxication), and the tavern (the Sufi gathering place). Translations of Ghalib's work are particularly significant, as Mirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib (1797-1869) represents the pinnacle of Urdu poetic achievement, his verses combining philosophical depth, emotional complexity, and linguistic virtuosity. By presenting Ghalib alongside other masters of the Urdu tradition, the collection demonstrates the richness and sophistication of this literary heritage. The work appeared during a period of growing Western interest in Eastern spirituality and mysticism, which Inayat Khan actively promoted through his establishment of the Sufi Order in London in 1914. His translations served both aesthetic and pedagogical purposes—introducing beautiful poetry while simultaneously conveying Sufi spiritual concepts that emphasize love, devotion, and the direct experiential knowledge of divine reality. The collection's influence extended beyond its immediate literary impact, contributing to broader appreciation of Urdu poetry and Sufi mysticism in Western intellectual and spiritual circles. Today, this anthology represents an important historical document in cross-cultural literary exchange, demonstrating how traditional Hindustani poetic forms and Islamic mystical philosophy were interpreted and transmitted to Western audiences during the early twentieth century.
