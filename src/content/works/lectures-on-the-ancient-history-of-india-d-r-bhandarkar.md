# Lectures on the Ancient History of India (650-325 B.C.)

## Overview

These four lectures delivered as the Carmichael Lectures at the University of Calcutta examine India's political evolution during 650-325 BCE, the period immediately preceding Mauryan imperial expansion. Bhandarkar analyzes the completion of Aryan colonization of southern India, the consolidation of sixteen small states into four major monarchies during Buddha's lifetime, and the administrative structures of both monarchical and republican forms of government (including oligarchies and democracies) that coexisted in ancient India. The lectures document political centralization and the gradual evolution toward imperialism in pre-Mauryan India.

## About Devadatta Ramkrishna Bhandarkar

Devadatta Ramkrishna Bhandarkar (1875-1950) was an Indian archaeologist and epigraphist who worked extensively with the Archaeological Survey of India. He served as the Carmichael Professor of Ancient Indian History and Culture at the University of Calcutta from 1917 to 1936. His scholarly work focused on inscriptions, archaeology, and ancient Indian history, making significant contributions to understanding India's pre-Mauryan and Mauryan periods.

## Historical Context

Published in 1919 based on lectures delivered in February 1918, this work emerged during the peak of British colonial scholarship on India. As the Carmichael Professor, Bhandarkar delivered these lectures to academic audiences at the University of Calcutta, representing Indian scholarly engagement with ancient history during a period when such academic positions were becoming available to Indian scholars.

## Academic Significance

The lectures provide detailed analysis of political developments in the crucial period between the Vedic age and the Mauryan empire. Bhandarkar examines the transition from numerous small states to larger political formations, documenting both monarchical and republican systems that existed in ancient India. His work contributes to understanding the political foundations upon which the Mauryan empire would later build.

## Content and Structure

The work consists of four lectures examining:
- The completion of Aryan colonization across the Indian subcontinent
- Political consolidation from sixteen small states to four major monarchies
- Administrative structures of monarchical governments
- Republican forms of government including oligarchies and democracies
- The evolution toward imperial centralization
