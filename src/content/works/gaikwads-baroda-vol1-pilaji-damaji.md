# The Gaikwads of Baroda: English Documents Vol. I

## Overview

This 202-page documentary collection edited by J. H. Gense (1936) presents English-language archival materials chronicling the Gaekwad dynasty's foundational period in Baroda (Vadodara, Gujarat). The volume focuses on Pilaji Rao Gaekwad, who conquered Baroda from declining Mughal authority in 1721, and his successor Damaji Rao Gaekwad (1732-1768), documenting their transformation from Maratha military commanders into sovereign rulers of a major princely state.

The documents include diplomatic correspondence with English trading companies, revenue settlement records, accounts of conflicts with European factors, details of Damaji's maritime activities in Gujarat, and internal Maratha political struggles. This material captures critical mid-18th-century dynamics when regional powers were consolidating control over territories fragmented by Mughal decline, while navigating relationships with emerging European commercial-military presences. Essential for understanding Maratha state-formation, 18th-century Gujarat history, and early English-Maratha relations. Available through Archive.org (DLI collection), public domain.
