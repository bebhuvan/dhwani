description: "The Panchadasi represents medieval Advaita Vedanta's most systematic and accessible exposition, presenting non-dualistic philosophy through fifteen chapters addressing consciousness (chit), bliss (ananda), and their manifestations. Composed in 14th century CE by Vidyaranya (Madhavacharya), philosopher-monk who became Vijayanagara empire's prime minister, this masterwork of approximately 2,200 verses systematizes Advaita teachings through clear definitions, logical arguments, illustrative examples, and practical instructions. The work addresses consciousness as sole reality underlying all experience, Brahman-Atman identity through systematic analysis, world's apparent reality and ultimate illusory nature (maya), liberation requiring Self-knowledge achieved through discrimination and meditation, and bliss as consciousness's essential nature rather than acquired state. Beyond technical philosophy, the Panchadasi presents accessible pedagogy: explaining difficult concepts through everyday analogies, addressing common objections systematically, and providing meditation instructions for direct realization. The work influenced Advaita teaching profoundly as standard introductory text, demonstrating medieval Vedanta's pedagogical sophistication and proving non-dualism's systematic exposition through clear accessible presentation."
