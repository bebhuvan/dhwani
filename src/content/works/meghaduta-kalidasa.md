description: "Kalidasa's Meghaduta stands as Sanskrit literature's supreme lyric achievement, a 120-verse poem in mandakranta meter where an exiled yaksha (nature spirit) entreats a monsoon cloud to carry messages to his distant beloved. Composed in 5th century CE during the Gupta golden age, this mahakavya in miniature exemplifies Kalidasa's unmatched descriptive powers: the cloud's northward journey from Ramagiri mountain through Central India to the Himalayas becomes occasion for exquisite geographical descriptions, seasonal observations, and emotional landscapes where external nature mirrors internal longing. The poem divides into Purva-megha (Former Cloud, 66 verses describing the journey) and Uttara-megha (Latter Cloud, 54 verses depicting the beloved and requesting message delivery). Beyond romantic sentiment, the work demonstrates Sanskrit poetry's capacity for sustained mood (viraha-shringara rasaâ€”separation in love), geographical precision serving poetic purposes, and the pathetic fallacy where nature sympathetically responds to human emotion. The Meghaduta influenced centuries of Sanskrit and regional literature, establishing the sandesha-kavya (messenger poem) genre and providing template for nature description in Indian aesthetics."
