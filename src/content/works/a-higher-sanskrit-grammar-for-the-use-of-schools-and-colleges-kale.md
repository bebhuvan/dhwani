description: "Moreshvar Ramchandra Kale's Higher Sanskrit Grammar represents early twentieth-century India's pedagogical response to Sanskrit education's practical demands, providing students and teachers a systematic grammatical framework grounded in Paninian tradition yet organized for modern classroom instruction. First published in the early 1900s and continuously revised through multiple editions, this comprehensive work follows Panini's sutras as explained by Bhattoji Diksita, translating technical rules into accessible English while preserving Sanskrit originals in footnotes for advanced study. The grammar's structure reflects pedagogical innovation: exhaustive treatment of sandhi (phonological combinations) and declensions; special attention to compounds (samasa) dominating classical Sanskrit literature; systematic presentation of feminine base formations; alphabetical arrangement of taddhita (secondary) affixes for easy reference; and detailed conjugation chapters with rules illustrated through abundant examples. Kale's methodology balances traditional commentary with modern organization, making Paninian grammar comprehensible to English-educated students while maintaining scholarly rigor. His work proved foundational for Sanskrit pedagogy across Indian universities and remains influential through Motilal Banarsidass's continuing publication. Beyond grammar instruction, Kale established his scholarly reputation through critical editions of Kalidasa's works—Abhijnana Shakuntala, Raghuvamsha, and Kumarasambhava—featuring traditional Sanskrit commentaries (Mallinatha, Raghavabhatta), English translations, and extensive notes, making classical Sanskrit literature accessible to generations of students. The Higher Sanskrit Grammar thus represents both practical pedagogy and the scholarly tradition of making Sanskrit accessible without sacrificing depth, enabling modern students to engage classical texts through systematic grammatical knowledge."
