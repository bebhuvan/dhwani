description: "The Markandeya Purana stands among the eighteen Mahapuranas as the oldest and most eclectic, containing the foundational Shakta text Devi Mahatmya (Glory of the Goddess) that established theological foundations for Goddess worship across Hindu traditions. Composed between 250-550 CE, this Purana of approximately 9,000 verses comprises cosmology, mythology, dharma teachings, and most significantly, chapters 81-93 containing the Devi Mahatmya (also called Durga Saptashati or Chandi Path)â€”700 verses narrating how the supreme Goddess Durga/Chandika defeats demons Madhu-Kaitabha, Mahishasura, and Shumbha-Nishumbha, establishing her as Shakti (cosmic power) underlying all existence. B. Hale Wortham's translation of Books VII-VIII made the Devi Mahatmya accessible to English readers, revealing sophisticated Shakta theology where feminine divine power creates, sustains, and destroys the universe. The text's influence on Hindu Goddess worship, Tantric philosophy, and devotional movements proves foundational, inspiring art, liturgy, and theology across centuries."
