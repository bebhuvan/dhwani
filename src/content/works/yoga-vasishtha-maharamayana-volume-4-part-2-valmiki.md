The Yoga-Vasishtha Maharamayana, Volume 4, Part 2, brings to completion the fourth and final major volume of this seven-volume masterwork on Advaita Vedanta philosophy and the path to supreme liberation. This concluding section represents the culmination of the transformative dialogue between the enlightened sage Vasistha and Prince Rama, synthesizing all previous teachings into a unified vision of ultimate reality and presenting the final instructions on abiding in the state of absolute freedom. As the concluding part of Volume 4 in the complete series, it delivers the most profound and liberating wisdom of the entire Maharamayana.

This portion completes the Nirvana Prakarana (Section on Ultimate Extinction), fully elaborating the nature of final liberation and the characteristics of one who has realized the supreme truth. Vasistha guides Rama to the direct recognition of his own essential nature as pure consciousness, beyond all limitations of body, mind, and individual personality. The teachings address the ultimate paradox of spiritual attainment: the realization that there is nothing to attain, nowhere to go, and no one to become, because one's true nature has always been and will always be the infinite, eternal, blissful consciousness that underlies all existence.

The concluding discussions in Volume 4, Part 2 of the complete 7-volume series bring together all the philosophical threads woven throughout the previous volumes. Vasistha presents the final instructions on how to remain established in supreme consciousness while engaging in worldly activities, describing the state of jivanmukti (liberation while living) with unprecedented clarity and depth. The text concludes with Rama's complete awakening to his true nature, serving as both an inspiration and a practical guide for all seekers on the path of wisdom.

This translation by Vihari-Lala Mitra preserves the majesty and profundity of the original Sanskrit, offering English readers access to one of the greatest spiritual and philosophical texts ever composed. For students of Advaita Vedanta and seekers of ultimate truth, Volume 4, Part 2 represents the pinnacle of wisdom literature, completing the magnificent journey of consciousness discovering itself.
