description: "Magha's Shishupalavadha (The Slaying of Shishupala) represents the apex of Sanskrit ornate poetry, ranking among the 'Great Six' classical mahakavyas for its extraordinary linguistic virtuosity and technical brilliance. This 18-canto epic narrates Krishna's slaying of the arrogant king Shishupala at Yudhishthira's Rajasuya sacrifice, drawn from Mahabharata's Sabha Parva, but transforms a brief epic episode into showcase for poetic artistry. Magha's genius manifests in the famous sarvatobhadra stanza (Canto 19, verse 12)â€”a palindromic verse readable forwards, backwards, vertically, and diagonally, yielding consistent meaning. The work exemplifies the mahargitalakshana (grand ornate) style emphasizing complex alankara (poetic figures), virtuoso compound words, intricate meters, and erudite allusions. Composed in 7th-century Gujarat, the poem established standards for technical excellence that later poets struggled to match, earning the Sanskrit critical maxim: 'Kalidasa for sweetness, Bharavi for depth, Magha for ornate grandeur.'"
