  L. A. Waddell's meticulously documented archaeological excavation report represents a pivotal scholarly intervention in understanding the material and cultural landscape of Pataliputra, the imperial capital of the Mauryan Empire during one of India's most transformative historical periods (circa 322-185 BCE). Situated in contemporary Patna, Bihar, this comprehensive study emerged during a critical juncture of colonial scholarship, when Western researchers were systematically documenting India's archaeological heritage through empirical methodologies. Waddell, a British physician and orientalist with specialized training in archaeology, conducted detailed stratigraphic analysis that revealed complex urban infrastructure, architectural techniques, and material culture characteristic of the Mauryan administrative and cultural center. The report provides nuanced insights into the sophisticated urban planning, architectural innovations, and social structures of one of ancient India's most significant metropolitan environments. By meticulously documenting structural remains, artifact typologies, and contextual archaeological data, Waddell's work contributed substantially to understanding the architectural and technological achievements of the Mauryan period. The nine appendices offer critical supplementary scholarship, including detailed examinations of Mauryan historical chronologies, stone construction techniques, sculptural traditions, and comprehensive translations of Chinese pilgrim accounts. Particularly noteworthy is Waddell's exploration of Upagupta, the influential Buddhist monk and spiritual advisor to Emperor Ashoka, providing crucial insights into the religious and intellectual dynamics of the period. This groundbreaking report represents an important early academic engagement with India's archaeological heritage, bridging colonial-era scholarship with emerging methodological approaches in historical and archaeological research.

# Report on the Excavations at Pātaliputra (Patna): The Palibothra of the Greeks

## Overview

This 123-page archaeological report by Lieutenant-Colonel L. A. Waddell, M.B., LL.D., I.M.S., published in Calcutta in 1903, documents systematic excavations at Pataliputra—the ancient capital city of the Mauryan Empire known to the Greeks as Palibothra. The report represents early scientific archaeology in India and provides foundational documentation of one of ancient India's most significant urban centers.

## Historical Context

Although not India's oldest city, Pataliputra served as the seat of India's most powerful ancient dynasties and represents "the first fixed landmark in Indian chronology." The site's importance stems from its role as capital of the Mauryan Empire (322-185 BCE), particularly under Chandragupta Maurya and his grandson Ashoka. Waddell's excavations came at a time when archaeological methods were developing in India, contributing crucial evidence for Mauryan period chronology and urbanism.

## Content

**Structure**: The report is organized into chapters covering:
- Historical introduction to Pataliputra
- Search for and discovery of the lost site
- Excavations of the city walls
- Excavations of the Mauryan palace
- Detailed artifact descriptions and stratigraphic analysis

**Nine Appendices Cover**:
1. The Mauryas - dynastic history and chronology
2. Origin of stone building and sculpture in India
3. Legend of Pataliputra's founding
4. Descriptions from Chinese pilgrims' records (Fa-Hien, Xuanzang)
5. Upagupta - Ashoka's high priest and Buddhist patriarch

**Archaeological Findings**: Documents discovery of massive timber palisades, structural remains of fortifications, palace architecture, pottery sequences, and various artifacts crucial for understanding Mauryan material culture and urban planning.

## Significance

This report provided early scientific documentation of Pataliputra, establishing baseline data for subsequent archaeological investigations. The work was significant for:
- Confirming ancient literary descriptions (Indian and Greek sources)
- Establishing Mauryan period construction techniques
- Contributing to chronological frameworks for ancient Indian history
- Documenting the scale and sophistication of Mauryan urbanism

The excavations revealed evidence supporting historical accounts of Pataliputra as a magnificent capital city, including remains of massive fortifications and palace structures. While some of Waddell's interpretations have been revised by later archaeology, the report remains valuable primary documentation.

## How to Access

Available through Internet Archive (DLI collection) with full text freely accessible. The report is also held in the Archaeological Survey of India Central Archaeological Library. Essential reading for anyone studying Mauryan period archaeology, ancient Indian urbanism, or the history of Indian archaeological practice.
