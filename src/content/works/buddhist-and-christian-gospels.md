description: '"Buddhist and Christian Gospels" represents a landmark scholarly exploration
  of comparative religious textual analysis during the early 20th-century intellectual
  renaissance, systematically investigating profound parallelisms between Buddhist
  Pali canonical texts and Christian scriptural traditions. Published in 1914, this
  collaborative work by American scholar Albert Joseph Edmunds and Japanese Buddhist
  expert Masaharu Anesaki emerged during a pivotal period of cross-cultural academic
  exchange, presenting meticulous comparative analysis of ethical teachings, narrative
  structures, and philosophical frameworks across Buddhist and Christian traditions.
  The study''s significance extends beyond mere textual comparison, offering nuanced
  insights into shared humanistic principles embedded in religious discourse, particularly
  illuminating the philosophical sophistication of Indian Buddhist thought. By employing
  rigorous parallel-text methodology, Edmunds and Anesaki systematically traced textual
  and conceptual resonances, demonstrating remarkable structural and thematic similarities
  in parables, moral teachings, and narrative techniques between these seemingly disparate
  spiritual traditions. The work critically contributes to understanding Buddhism''s
  philosophical depth, highlighting its universal ethical principles and sophisticated
  hermeneutical approaches that transcend cultural boundaries. For Indian intellectual
  heritage, this study represents an early, scholarly engagement with Buddhism''s
  global philosophical significance, challenging prevailing colonial-era epistemological
  frameworks and presenting indigenous religious thought as a complex, intellectually
  robust tradition. The text''s methodological innovation lies in its dispassionate,
  comparative approach, eschewing reductive orientalist perspectives and instead emphasizing
  substantive philosophical dialogue between Eastern and Western religious frameworks,
  thereby positioning Indian Buddhist scholarship within a sophisticated global intellectual
  landscape.

# Buddhist and Christian Gospels

## Overview

Buddhist and Christian Gospels (1914) by Albert Joseph Edmunds and Masaharu Anesaki systematically presents parallel passages from Buddhist Pali texts and Christian Gospel accounts through side-by-side comparison. This 340-page work (Innes & Sons, Philadelphia) represents pioneering methodology in comparative religious studies—not merely asserting influence but providing readers with primary textual evidence to evaluate similarities and differences in narratives, teachings, and ethical precepts between these two major religious traditions.

## About the Authors

Albert Joseph Edmunds (1857-1941) was an American scholar and librarian who specialized in comparative religious studies, particularly the relationship between Buddhism and Christianity. His work reflected the late nineteenth and early twentieth-century fascination with discovering connections between world religions. Masaharu Anesaki (1873-1949) was a distinguished Japanese scholar of religion who became one of the first professors of religious studies at Tokyo Imperial University. His collaboration with Edmunds brought Japanese Buddhist scholarship into dialogue with Western comparative religion. Together, their cross-cultural collaboration exemplified the international nature of religious studies in the early twentieth century.

## Historical Context

Published in 1914, this work appeared during a period of intense scholarly interest in comparative religion, influenced by evolutionary theories that sought to trace the development of religious ideas across cultures. The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries saw numerous attempts to identify parallels between different religious traditions, sometimes to argue for common origins or mutual influence. The question of whether Buddhism influenced early Christianity through trade routes or cultural contact generated considerable scholarly debate. Edmunds and Anesaki's work contributed to this discussion by systematically presenting textual parallels, allowing readers to evaluate similarities and differences between Buddhist and Christian narratives and teachings.

## Literary and Cultural Significance

This work advanced comparative religious methodology by letting texts speak for themselves through parallel presentation, moving beyond apologetic or polemical approaches. The American-Japanese scholarly collaboration modeled international cooperation in religious studies while addressing early 20th-century debates about possible historical connections between Buddhism and Christianity. While subsequent scholarship has been more cautious about claims of direct influence, the systematic textual comparison methodology established here influenced how comparative religious studies approaches cross-traditional analysis. The work helped Western audiences recognize Buddhism's sophisticated ethical and philosophical content, challenging orientalist stereotypes while fostering interfaith understanding through scholarly rigor.
