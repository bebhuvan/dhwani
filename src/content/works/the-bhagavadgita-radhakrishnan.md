  Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan's "The Bhagavadgita" (1948), published by George Allen & Unwin in London, represents one of the twentieth century's most influential interpretations of Hinduism's central philosophical text, combining rigorous Sanskrit scholarship with philosophical commentary synthesizing Vedantic thought and Western philosophical traditions. Appearing shortly after Indian independence (1947), the work contributed to defining modern Hindu identity and articulating Indian philosophical heritage for international audiences during the critical period of postcolonial nation-building and cultural reassertion. Radhakrishnan's edition distinguished itself through comprehensive structure: an extensive introductory essay situating the Gita within Indian philosophical and religious history, complete transliterated Sanskrit text of all seven hundred verses enabling scholarly verification, precise English translation balancing literal accuracy with literary clarity, and detailed verse-by-verse commentary explicating philosophical concepts, resolving interpretive disputes, and relating ancient teachings to contemporary ethical and metaphysical questions. As one of the most widely read and translated Hindu scriptures globally, the Bhagavad Gita required interpretation navigating tensions between traditional devotional readings emphasizing bhakti (devotional surrender to Krishna), philosophical interpretations stressing jnana (knowledge of ultimate reality), and ethical-political readings highlighting karma yoga (disciplined action without attachment to results). Radhakrishnan's commentary synthesized these perspectives while privileging philosophical dimensions consonant with Advaita Vedanta's non-dualistic metaphysics, positioning the Gita as articulating universal spiritual truths transcending sectarian Hinduism and applicable to modern ethical dilemmas including violence, duty, and meaning in secular contexts. His interpretation addressed the text's central problem: how Arjuna's crisis on the Kurukshetra battlefield—confronting duty to fight relatives and teachers in fratricidal war—generates Krishna's teachings encompassing cosmology, epistemology, ethics, and spiritual practice. Radhakrishnan emphasized the Gita's synthesis of competing philosophical schools including Samkhya dualism, Yoga discipline, Vedanta non-dualism, and bhakti devotionalism, arguing that the text's genius lay in integrating apparently contradictory paths (knowledge, action, devotion) into comprehensive spiritual framework acknowledging different temperaments and capacities. He interpreted key concepts including dharma (righteous duty), karma (action and its consequences), moksha (liberation from rebirth), and the relationship between individual self (atman) and ultimate reality (Brahman), consistently emphasizing experiential realization over dogmatic belief and ethical action over ritualistic observance. The commentary addressed perennial interpretive disputes including whether the Gita advocates violence (given Krishna's exhortation to Arjuna to fight), how to reconcile its theistic devotionalism with Vedantic non-dualism, and whether its caste-based duty concept reinforces hierarchy or can be reinterpreted for egalitarian contexts. Radhakrishnan's responses typically universalized particular references, interpreting the battlefield allegorically as internal spiritual struggle, dharma as universal ethical principles rather than caste-specific obligations, and Krishna as manifestation of impersonal Brahman accommodating human need for personal relationship with the divine. This interpretive strategy served multiple purposes: defending Hinduism against colonial characterizations as polytheistic idolatry or fatalistic passivity, presenting Indian philosophy as rational and universal rather than culturally-bound superstition, and providing ethical framework for modern Indians negotiating traditional values and contemporary challenges. The work exemplified Neo-Vedanta's characteristic moves—emphasizing philosophical over ritualistic dimensions, universal ethics over caste hierarchy, experiential spirituality over sectarian dogma, and compatibility between Indian wisdom and Western rationality—while claiming transhistorical authenticity rather than acknowledging modern reformulation. Published during his Oxford professorship (Spalding Chair of Eastern Religions and Ethics, 1936-1952) and shortly before his diplomatic and political career (Ambassador to USSR 1949-1952, Vice President 1952-1962, President 1962-1967), the work consolidated Radhakrishnan's reputation as cultural mediator interpreting Indian philosophy for Western audiences while providing educated Indians with sophisticated, pride-instilling presentation of their religious heritage. The translation and commentary became standard academic reference, shaping generations of scholarly and popular engagement with the Gita while generating ongoing debates about whether Radhakrishnan's philosophical sophistication captured or distorted the text's original meanings, and whether his universalist interpretation genuinely transcended cultural particulars or imposed modern liberal values and Brahminical perspectives on complex, multivalent scripture.

## Publication History and Scholarly Impact

"The Bhagavadgita" first appeared in 1948 through London publisher George Allen & Unwin, priced at 10 shillings and 6 pence, comprising 388 pages of Sanskrit text, translation, and philosophical commentary. The timing proved historically significant: appearing one year after Indian independence (August 1947), the work contributed to postcolonial cultural reassertion and intellectual decolonization, providing sophisticated presentation of Hindu philosophy for international audiences while offering educated Indians pride-instilling interpretation of their religious heritage grounded in rigorous scholarship rather than apologetics. Radhakrishnan occupied the Spalding Chair of Eastern Religions and Ethics at Oxford University (1936-1952) during composition, positioning him as authoritative interpreter of Indian thought for Western academic and general audiences. The work's scholarly apparatus—complete transliterated Sanskrit enabling verification, extensive footnotes engaging classical commentators including Shankara, Ramanuja, and Madhva, and philosophical analysis relating Gita teachings to Western thinkers including Plato, Kant, and Bergson—established legitimacy within academic religious studies while remaining accessible to educated non-specialists. The translation achieved remarkable longevity, remaining in print continuously through multiple publishers including HarperCollins India, with 2009 edition indicating sustained demand over six decades. Its influence shaped generations of scholarly and popular engagement with the Gita: mainstream academic and devotional understanding remained "stuck in 1948" according to contemporary critics, testifying to Radhakrishnan's interpretive dominance even as newer translations and commentaries proliferated. The work's success reflected Radhakrishnan's unique positioning as both traditional Sanskrit pandit and modern philosopher, British-educated academic and Indian cultural nationalist, producing interpretation simultaneously honoring textual tradition and addressing contemporary philosophical questions about ethics, meaning, and transcendence in secular modernity.

## Structure and Methodology: Introductory Essay

Radhakrishnan's extensive introductory essay—occupying substantial portion of the work's 388 pages—situated the Bhagavad Gita within broader currents of Indian philosophical and religious development, establishing historical context essential for informed interpretation. He examined the text's probable composition date (between fifth century BCE and second century CE), its insertion into the Mahabharata epic, and debates about authorship and textual integrity, engaging contemporary Sanskrit scholarship while defending the Gita's philosophical coherence against claims it represented mere compilation of contradictory teachings. The essay traced the Gita's relationship to Upanishadic philosophy, arguing that it synthesized Vedantic metaphysics with practical ethics and devotional theism, making abstract philosophical insights accessible through narrative drama and personal relationship with the divine. Radhakrishnan examined the text's treatment of competing philosophical schools: Samkhya's dualistic metaphysics distinguishing consciousness (purusha) from matter (prakritti), Yoga's systematic meditation practices, Vedanta's non-dualistic identification of individual self with universal Brahman, and bhakti's emotional devotion to personal deity. He argued that rather than eclectically combining incompatible perspectives, the Gita demonstrated synthetic genius, recognizing that different temperaments require different spiritual paths while maintaining that all authentic paths converge on identical realization. The essay addressed perennial interpretive disputes including whether the text's call to battle endorsed violence, how to reconcile Krishna's personal theism with impersonal Brahman, and whether caste-based dharma reinforced oppressive hierarchy or represented universal principle of fulfilling one's nature and social role. Radhakrishnan's methodology privileged philosophical over historical-critical approaches: rather than reconstructing original meanings through linguistic and contextual analysis, he articulated timeless truths the text revealed to contemplative readers regardless of historical contingencies. This hermeneutic reflected his conviction that scriptures constitute "scientific records of spiritual insights"—experiential reports of realized sages rather than cultural constructions—making philosophical commentary more appropriate than historical deconstruction. The introductory essay thus functioned simultaneously as scholarly apparatus establishing textual credentials and philosophical manifesto articulating Radhakrishnan's Neo-Vedanta vision of Hinduism as rational, universal, and ethically sophisticated tradition addressing perennial human questions.

## Translation Philosophy: Between Literalism and Interpretation

Radhakrishnan's English translation navigated persistent tensions between literal accuracy preserving Sanskrit semantic range and readable interpretation conveying philosophical substance for audiences lacking traditional commentarial knowledge. Unlike purely devotional translations prioritizing poetic beauty and emotional impact, or academic versions emphasizing philological precision through awkward English, Radhakrishnan sought middle path combining scholarly rigor with literary clarity and philosophical depth. He provided complete transliterated Sanskrit text enabling verification and study, crucial for academic legitimacy and addressing claims that translations impose foreign categories on original meanings. Each verse received careful English rendering attending to grammatical structure and lexical choices while avoiding Sanskrit philosophical terminology where English equivalents existed, though retaining key concepts (dharma, karma, yoga, moksha) whose complex meanings resisted simple translation. Radhakrishnan's notes acknowledged alternative readings and interpretive disputes, engaging classical commentators and modern scholars while ultimately defending preferred interpretations consonant with Advaita Vedanta's non-dualistic metaphysics. His translation emphasized the Gita's philosophical universality rather than Hindu particularity, rendering culturally-specific references in ways permitting generalizable application: caste becomes vocational aptitude, ritual sacrifice becomes selfless action, Krishna's divine manifestation becomes impersonal ultimate reality assuming personal form for devotional accessibility. This interpretive strategy served multiple purposes: countering colonial characterizations of Hinduism as polytheistic superstition, demonstrating Indian philosophy's rational sophistication, and providing ethical framework applicable to modern contexts far removed from ancient Indian social structures. However, critics identified tensions: whether universalizing interpretation genuinely captured textual meanings or imposed modern liberal values, whether emphasizing philosophical dimensions marginalized devotional and ritualistic elements central to traditional practice, and whether Radhakrishnan's Brahminical perspective adequately represented diverse Hindu traditions including Dalit, tribal, and regional interpretations. Contemporary translation theory recognizes that all translation involves interpretation reflecting translator's philosophical commitments, social location, and intended audiences, making transparency about interpretive choices more honest than claims to neutral objectivity. Radhakrishnan's achievement lay not in eliminating interpretation but in producing philosophically sophisticated, literarily accomplished translation making profound and difficult text accessible while maintaining scholarly integrity.

## Philosophical Commentary: Synthesizing Competing Paths

Radhakrishnan's verse-by-verse commentary synthesized the Gita's integration of jnana yoga (knowledge), karma yoga (action), and bhakti yoga (devotion) into comprehensive spiritual framework acknowledging different temperaments while maintaining underlying unity. He interpreted the text's central teaching—Arjuna must fight despite moral revulsion because righteous duty (dharma) transcends personal preference and consequences—through multiple lenses simultaneously: psychological analysis of Arjuna's crisis revealing universal human conflicts between duty and desire, ethical examination of deontological versus consequentialist frameworks for moral decision-making, and metaphysical argument that action performed without attachment to results liberates rather than binds. Radhakrishnan emphasized karma yoga as the Gita's distinctive contribution: synthesis of contemplative withdrawal and worldly engagement, recognizing that most people cannot renounce action entirely but can transform action's spiritual significance through disciplined detachment. He explicated Krishna's teaching that attachment to results rather than action itself causes bondage, arguing that performing duty as offering to divine rather than serving ego enables liberation while fulfilling social responsibilities. This interpretation addressed modern tensions between spiritual transcendence and material engagement, suggesting that authentic spirituality transforms rather than escapes worldly existence. Radhakrishnan's treatment of bhakti (devotion) acknowledged its centrality—over half the Gita's verses emphasize devotional surrender to Krishna—while subordinating personal theism to non-dualistic metaphysics by interpreting Krishna as manifestation of impersonal Brahman accommodating human need for personal relationship with ultimate reality. This hierarchical pluralism recognized devotion's validity while positioning knowledge of non-dual reality as higher realization, reflecting Advaita Vedanta's characteristic structure. His commentary on jnana yoga emphasized experiential realization over intellectual understanding, arguing that true knowledge involves direct intuition of one's essential identity with Brahman rather than merely conceptual belief. He interpreted the Gita's metaphysical teachings—including the distinction between perishable body and imperishable self, the identification of individual atman with universal Brahman, and the manifestation of multiplicity from non-dual unity—as empirical reports from contemplative experience rather than speculative philosophy, positioning meditation as experimental methodology verifying scriptural claims. This epistemological framework defended religious knowledge against empiricist critiques while maintaining commitment to experiential grounding, characteristic of Radhakrishnan's broader philosophical project.

## Ethical and Political Interpretation: Violence, Duty, and Caste

Radhakrishnan confronted the Gita's most challenging interpretive problem: how to reconcile Krishna's exhortation that Arjuna must fight—killing relatives, teachers, and friends in fratricidal war—with claims that the text teaches universal ethics of non-violence and compassion. His response combined allegorical interpretation, contextual analysis, and philosophical abstraction. He suggested the battlefield represents internal spiritual struggle against ignorance, desire, and ego rather than literal warfare, making the teaching applicable to anyone confronting difficult duties requiring sacrifice of personal preferences. Simultaneously, he acknowledged the text's plain meaning addresses actual combat, interpreting Krishna's teaching as articulating tragic dimensions of ethical life where competing legitimate obligations conflict, requiring action despite moral ambiguity. Radhakrishnan argued that the Gita's central point concerns attitude rather than specific action: performing duty with detachment from personal gain, maintaining equanimity toward success and failure, and acting as instrument of divine purpose rather than autonomous agent pursuing selfish ends. This interpretation enabled applying the teaching to diverse contexts—soldiers facing combat, professionals navigating careers, citizens fulfilling civic responsibilities—without endorsing indiscriminate violence or fatalistic acceptance of injustice. His treatment of dharma (righteous duty) addressed tensions between the text's apparent endorsement of caste-based obligations—Arjuna must fight because warrior dharma requires military service—and modern egalitarian values rejecting hereditary hierarchy. Radhakrishnan distinguished between eternal dharma (universal ethical principles including truthfulness, non-violence, and compassion) and contingent dharma (culturally-specific duties reflecting particular social arrangements), arguing that the Gita ultimately subordinates caste obligations to universal spiritual realization transcending social distinctions. He reinterpreted varna (caste) as representing vocational aptitudes and personality types rather than hereditary hierarchy, suggesting that each person should fulfill duties consonant with their nature and capacities regardless of birth. This interpretation enabled retaining the text's emphasis on fulfilling one's proper role while rejecting oppressive dimensions of caste system, though critics argued it imposed modern liberal values on text explicitly endorsing Brahmin supremacy and warrior violence. Radhakrishnan's ethical interpretation exemplified characteristic Neo-Vedanta moves: universalizing particular cultural elements, emphasizing spiritual over social dimensions, and defending traditional texts against Western criticisms by reinterpreting problematic passages while claiming fidelity to authentic meaning.

## The Symbolism of the Cosmic Tree and Divine Vision

Radhakrishnan's commentary on the Gita's symbolic imagery—particularly the inverted cosmic tree (ashvattha) in Chapter 15 and Arjuna's vision of Krishna's universal form in Chapter 11—demonstrated his capacity to elucidate profound metaphysical concepts through accessible philosophical analysis. The ashvattha tree, with roots above in Brahman and branches extending downward into material manifestation, represents the emanation of multiplicity from non-dual source and the possibility of reversing this descent through spiritual ascent cutting attachment to worldly entanglements. Radhakrishnan interpreted this imagery as depicting the relationship between ultimate reality and phenomenal existence: the empirical world, while not ultimately real (in the sense of possessing independent substantial existence), derives whatever reality it possesses from participation in Brahman, making spiritual practice a process of recognizing this dependent nature and reorienting consciousness toward its transcendent source. His explication balanced Vedantic non-dualism—asserting that multiplicity represents illusory superimposition on non-dual reality—with pragmatic acknowledgment that embodied existence requires engaging phenomenal world even while recognizing its relative nature. The commentary on Arjuna's vision of Krishna's cosmic form (vishvarupa) in Chapter 11—where the divine reveals itself as simultaneously creative and destructive, encompassing all existence in terrifying and beautiful totality—addressed the problem of reconciling personal devotion to Krishna with impersonal Brahman. Radhakrishnan interpreted the vision as demonstrating that ultimate reality transcends human categories of good and evil, beautiful and terrible, while manifesting in forms accessible to different levels of consciousness and spiritual development. The passage's emphasis that Arjuna can witness this revelation only through Krishna's grace highlighted bhakti's centrality, while Radhakrishnan's commentary subordinated personal theism to philosophical absolute by suggesting that the personal god serves as intermediary between limited human consciousness and ineffable Brahman. His treatment exemplified sophisticated theological balancing act: affirming devotional relationship's validity and transformative power while maintaining that realization of non-dual reality represents ultimate goal. This hierarchical inclusivism characterized his broader comparative religious vision, recognizing multiple valid spiritual paths while privileging philosophical realization over mythological literalism or ritualistic observance.

## Legacy and Continuing Influence

Radhakrishnan's Bhagavad Gita translation and commentary profoundly shaped twentieth-century global engagement with Hindu scripture, establishing interpretive framework that dominated academic and popular understanding for generations. The work's influence extended across multiple domains: religious studies curricula in Western universities adopted it as standard text introducing students to Hindu philosophy, generating widespread but potentially limited understanding shaped by Radhakrishnan's particular philosophical commitments. Educated Hindu audiences, particularly English-speaking middle and upper classes, embraced the work as authoritative interpretation combining traditional reverence with modern philosophical sophistication, providing pride-instilling presentation of religious heritage countering colonial deprecation. The commentary influenced interfaith dialogue by presenting Hinduism as rational, ethical, and universal tradition compatible with Western philosophy and Christian ethics, facilitating mutual understanding while potentially obscuring genuine differences in worldviews and practices. Contemporary scholarship increasingly examines the work's limitations and biases: feminist critics note Radhakrishnan's minimal attention to the Gita's gender politics and his reproduction of patriarchal assumptions, Dalit scholars challenge his Brahminical interpretation marginalizing lower-caste perspectives and reinterpreting caste as benign vocational differentiation, and postcolonial analysts recognize how his presentation internalized colonial categories even while challenging Western supremacy. The work exemplified Neo-Vedanta's characteristic tensions: successfully defending Hinduism's intellectual legitimacy and spiritual depth while potentially distorting traditional meanings through modernizing reinterpretations, articulating universal philosophy transcending cultural particulars while imposing Brahminical elite perspectives as normative, and engaging Western thought productively while accepting problematic orientalist categories distinguishing mystical East from rational West. Despite these critiques, Radhakrishnan's achievement remains substantial: producing scholarly rigorous yet accessible interpretation making profound philosophical text available to global audiences, articulating coherent synthesis of the Gita's diverse teachings, and demonstrating Indian philosophy's capacity to address perennial human questions about meaning, ethics, and transcendence. His work established foundation enabling both uncritical acceptance and informed critique, making possible contemporary diversity of Gita interpretations including feminist readings, Dalit perspectives, ecological applications, and postcolonial analyses that challenge while building on his pioneering effort to present Hindu scripture as worthy of serious philosophical engagement.

## About Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan

**Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan** (1888-1975) emerged as twentieth-century India's most internationally prominent philosopher, achieving distinction as both academic intellectual and political statesman. Born into a Telugu Brahmin family in Tiruttani, Madras Presidency, Radhakrishnan received Christian missionary education before pursuing philosophy at Madras Christian College, where his 1908 M.A. thesis defending Vedanta against Western criticisms established his lifelong project of articulating Indian philosophy's contemporary relevance. His academic career proceeded through philosophy chairs at Mysore University (1918), Calcutta University's prestigious King George V Chair (1921-1931), and Oxford University's Spalding Chair of Eastern Religions and Ethics (1936-1952), making him the first Indian to hold major Western philosophical appointments. His major works—"Indian Philosophy" (two volumes, 1923-1927), "The Hindu View of Life" (1927), "An Idealist View of Life" (1929), and "Eastern Religions and Western Thought" (1939)—established international reputation while shaping Western understanding of Hinduism and Vedanta. Radhakrishnan's philosophical project synthesized Advaita Vedanta's non-dualistic metaphysics with Western idealism, developing concepts of "integral experience" and religious pluralism that positioned mystical intuition as authoritative knowledge transcending rational analysis while remaining subject to philosophical verification. His political career included serving as India's ambassador to the Soviet Union (1949-1952), Vice President (1952-1962), and President (1962-1967), embodying the philosopher-statesman ideal. As Vice Chancellor of Benares Hindu University (1939-1948) during the critical transition from colonial to independent India, he directly influenced educational policy while articulating visions of spiritually-grounded democracy and cultural nationalism that shaped postcolonial Indian identity. His birthday (September 5) is celebrated as Teachers' Day in India, reflecting his iconic status in Indian educational discourse. Contemporary scholarship increasingly examines the ambivalences in Radhakrishnan's thought—his reproduction of orientalist categories even while challenging Western supremacy, his elite Brahminical interpretations marginalizing subaltern perspectives, his philosophical idealism potentially obscuring material politics—while acknowledging his profound influence on twentieth-century Indian philosophy, education, and international understanding of Hindu traditions.
