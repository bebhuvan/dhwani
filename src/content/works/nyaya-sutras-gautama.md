description: "The Nyaya Sutras represent ancient India's foundational text on logic, epistemology, and methodology of inquiry, systematizing rational investigation through approximately 530 aphoristic sutras addressing valid knowledge sources, logical reasoning, debate methodology, and philosophical inquiry's proper conduct. Composed around 2nd century BCE by sage Gautama (Akshapada), this seminal work establishes Nyaya school's philosophical framework: four valid means of knowledge (perception, inference, comparison, testimony), theory of categories (sixteen padarthas including substance, quality, action, universal, particular), logical inference structure (five-membered syllogism), and debate taxonomy distinguishing genuine philosophical discussion from sophistry. Beyond technical logic, the Nyaya Sutras present comprehensive philosophical system addressing metaphysics, causation, God's existence, self's nature, and liberation through correct knowledge. The work profoundly influenced all subsequent Indian philosophy—Buddhist logicians engaged it critically developing alternative systems, Vedantins employed its methodologies, grammarians debated its categories—while demonstrating Indian philosophy's rigorous analytical tradition paralleling Greek logic yet developing distinctive approaches to reasoning, knowledge, and truth."
