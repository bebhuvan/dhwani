# Buddhist Birth-Stories (Jataka Tales)

## Overview

T.W. Rhys Davids' translation presents the Nidanakatha, the commentarial introduction to the Jataka tales, which provides an early connected biography of the Buddha in Buddhist literature (composed approximately 1st-5th century CE). The Nidanakatha traces the Buddha's journey across three sections: from his incarnation as Bodhisattva Sumedha through previous lives until birth in Tusita heaven, his life as Prince Siddhartha until enlightenment, and his early teaching career until Anathapindika's donation of Jetavana monastery. Translated from Viggo Fausböll's Pali edition, this work introduced Western audiences to the Jataka collection of over 550 folk tales concerning Buddha's previous births.

## About T.W. Rhys Davids

Thomas William Rhys Davids (1843-1922) was a Welsh scholar of Pali language and Buddhism who profoundly influenced Western understanding of early Buddhist texts. After serving in the Ceylon Civil Service (1866-1877), where he began studying Pali, he returned to England and founded the Pali Text Society in 1881. His translations and scholarly work established standards for Buddhist textual studies in English-speaking academia. He held professorships at University College London and the University of Manchester, training subsequent generations of Buddhist scholars.

## About the Nidanakatha

The Nidanakatha ("Story of the Lineage") serves as the introduction to the Jataka Atthakatha, the commentary on the collection of Jataka tales. Composed in Pali, it provides narrative structure connecting the 550+ individual Jataka stories by presenting them as accounts of the Buddha's previous births. The text synthesizes biographical details, legendary material, and doctrinal frameworks, establishing the bodhisattva path as the model for Buddhist practice across countless lifetimes.

## The Three Sections

**Dutthakatha (The Remote Epoch):**
Narrates the Buddha's first aspiration to become a Buddha during his life as the hermit Sumedha in the time of Buddha Dipankara, and traces his spiritual development through subsequent lives in various realms including heavens, hells, and earth.

**Avidure-nidana (The Not-Very-Remote Epoch):**
Covers the final existence in Tusita heaven before the bodhisattva's birth as Prince Siddhartha, including the decision to take human birth and the selection of family.

**Santike-nidana (The Proximate Epoch):**
Details Prince Siddhartha's life from miraculous birth through renunciation, ascetic practices, enlightenment under the Bodhi tree, and early teaching ministry until the establishment of Jetavana monastery.

## Scholarly Significance

This translation represents early Western scholarly engagement with Pali Buddhist texts. Published in 1878, it introduced Victorian audiences to Buddhist cosmology, ethics, and narrative traditions. Rhys Davids worked from Viggo Fausböll's edition of the Pali text, providing English readers access to materials previously unavailable outside specialized scholarly circles. The work influenced subsequent Buddhist studies and contributed to growing Western interest in Asian religions.

## Translation Methodology

Rhys Davids translated from Fausböll's critical Pali edition, providing both narrative flow and scholarly apparatus. The revised edition incorporated corrections and annotations by Caroline Rhys Davids, who herself became a distinguished Pali scholar. The translation balances readability for general audiences with accuracy required for academic purposes, making it accessible to both scholars and interested lay readers.

## The Broader Jataka Collection

While this volume focuses on the Nidanakatha introduction, it contextualizes the larger Jataka collection of 550+ tales. These stories, portraying the Buddha's previous births as various animals and humans, constitute one of the oldest and most influential bodies of Buddhist literature. The tales served pedagogical functions in Buddhist communities, illustrating ethical principles and doctrinal concepts through engaging narratives.

## Digital Preservation

This 256-page work, published by G. Routledge in London in 1878, has been digitized from the University of Toronto's Robarts Library collection and is freely accessible through the Internet Archive. Multiple editions and reprints demonstrate the work's enduring significance for Buddhist studies and comparative religious scholarship.
