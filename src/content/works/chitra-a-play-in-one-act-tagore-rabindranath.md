  Chitra: A Play in One Act is Rabindranath Tagore's lyrical drama first published in English in 1913 by the India Society of London and later by Macmillan in 1914, adapting a powerful episode from the ancient Indian epic Mahabharata. Originally written in Bengali in 1891 and published in 1893, Tagore himself translated this profound work into English, later reworking it into a dance drama in 1935 that remains a cornerstone of Bengali theater. The play centers on Chitrangada (or Chitra), daughter of the king of Manipur, who was raised as a prince because her father had no male heir, creating a fascinating exploration of gender identity, femininity, and authentic love. When the legendary warrior Arjuna arrives in Manipur during his period of exile and pilgrimage, Chitra falls deeply in love with him but fears he will not accept her in her masculine warrior form. She prays to Madana (the god of love) and Vasanta (the god of spring) to transform her into a woman of surpassing beauty for a single year. The gods grant her wish, and Arjuna falls passionately in love with this idealized version of Chitra, unaware of her true identity. The dramatic tension emerges from Chitra's internal conflict—she has won Arjuna's love through borrowed beauty but yearns for him to love her authentic self, the warrior princess beneath the divine glamour. As the year approaches its end, Chitra must decide whether to reveal her true identity and risk losing Arjuna's love, or to continue living a beautiful lie. The play traces her journey from seeking external validation through artificial beauty toward asserting her genuine identity as both warrior and woman, ultimately redefining womanhood on her own terms rather than conforming to traditional expectations. Tagore's treatment of this ancient story is remarkably modern, touching on themes of feminism, authentic identity, and the nature of true love that transcends mere physical attraction. The 1914 New York Times noted that Tagore "touched upon modern feminism" while using Hindu legends, recognizing the play's progressive examination of women's roles and self-determination. Written as a highly symbolic work where characters and events represent deeper ideas and feelings, Chitra presents Tagore's philosophy that genuine love must embrace the whole person—strength and vulnerability, beauty and imperfection, the idealized and the real. The play's elegant verse dialogue moves between intimate personal revelation and philosophical meditation, creating a work that functions simultaneously as romantic drama and spiritual allegory about the soul's journey toward self-acceptance and authentic connection.

# Chitra: A Play in One Act

## Overview

Chitra: A Play in One Act is Rabindranath Tagore's lyrical drama first published in English in 1913 by the India Society of London and later by Macmillan in 1914, adapting a powerful episode from the ancient Indian epic Mahabharata. Originally written in Bengali in 1891 and published in 1893, Tagore himself translated this profound work into English, later reworking it into a dance drama in 1935 that remains a cornerstone of Bengali theater.

The play centers on Chitrangada (or Chitra), daughter of the king of Manipur, who was raised as a prince because her father had no male heir, creating a fascinating exploration of gender identity, femininity, and authentic love. When the legendary warrior Arjuna arrives in Manipur during his period of exile and pilgrimage, Chitra falls deeply in love with him but fears he will not accept her in her masculine warrior form.

## The Divine Transformation

She prays to Madana (the god of love) and Vasanta (the god of spring) to transform her into a woman of surpassing beauty for a single year. The gods grant her wish, and Arjuna falls passionately in love with this idealized version of Chitra, unaware of her true identity. The dramatic tension emerges from Chitra's internal conflict—she has won Arjuna's love through borrowed beauty but yearns for him to love her authentic self, the warrior princess beneath the divine glamour.

As the year approaches its end, Chitra must decide whether to reveal her true identity and risk losing Arjuna's love, or to continue living a beautiful lie. The play traces her journey from seeking external validation through artificial beauty toward asserting her genuine identity as both warrior and woman, ultimately redefining womanhood on her own terms rather than conforming to traditional expectations.

## Themes and Significance

Tagore's treatment of this ancient story is remarkably modern, touching on themes of feminism, authentic identity, and the nature of true love that transcends mere physical attraction. The 1914 New York Times noted that Tagore "touched upon modern feminism" while using Hindu legends, recognizing the play's progressive examination of women's roles and self-determination.

Written as a highly symbolic work where characters and events represent deeper ideas and feelings, Chitra presents Tagore's philosophy that genuine love must embrace the whole person—strength and vulnerability, beauty and imperfection, the idealized and the real. The play's elegant verse dialogue moves between intimate personal revelation and philosophical meditation, creating a work that functions simultaneously as romantic drama and spiritual allegory about the soul's journey toward self-acceptance and authentic connection.
