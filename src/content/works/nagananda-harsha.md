description: "Harsha's Nagananda stands as Sanskrit drama's supreme Buddhist-influenced work, a five-act nataka (heroic romance) depicting Prince Jimutavahana's self-sacrifice to save the Naga (serpent) race from Garuda's predation, exemplifying Mahayana Buddhist ideals of compassionate self-offering (atmaparigraha) while integrating these within Hindu dramatic conventions. Composed by Emperor Harshavardhana, who patronized Buddhism extensively despite personal Shaivite inclinations, this sophisticated religious drama transcends sectarian boundaries by presenting Buddhist philosophy through universally accessible narrative about love, sacrifice, and redemption. The plot follows Jimutavahana, prince of Vidyadharas (celestial beings), who renounces royal succession to practice asceticism with his parents in Himalayas, marries the beautiful Malayavati, then discovers that Garuda (divine eagle) preys upon Nagas to fulfill ancient agreement. Moved by compassion, Jimutavahana secretly substitutes himself for the designated Naga victim, enduring Garuda's attack until divine intervention by goddess Gauri prevents death and converts Garuda from predator to protector. Beyond religious allegory, the play demonstrates Harsha's dramatic mastery: psychologically complex characters (Jimutavahana's heroic compassion, Malayavati's devoted terror, Garuda's proud cruelty transformed to remorse), spectacular staging opportunities (aerial beings, supernatural combat, miraculous healing), sophisticated integration of shringara (erotic), karuna (compassionate), vira (heroic), and adbhuta (marvelous) rasas, and profound exploration of themes including selflessness, redemption possibility, compassion's transformative power, and religious values' practical application. Nagananda influenced later Buddhist and Hindu religious drama, established templates for sacrifice narratives, and revealed how Sanskrit drama could convey religious teaching while remaining dramatically effective, making it simultaneously devotional text, philosophical discourse, and compelling theater worthy of serious literary and religious studies attention."
