# Literary History of Sanskrit Buddhism

## Overview

Gushtaspshah Kaikhushro Nariman's *Literary History of Sanskrit Buddhism* (1923) represents a significant synthesis of early 20th-century European Buddhist scholarship. This 430-page volume, published by the Indian Book Depot in Bombay, distills the research of three leading Buddhologists into an accessible survey of Sanskrit Buddhist literary traditions.

## Author and Context

Nariman (1873-1933) was a Parsi scholar known for his work on both Zoroastrianism and Buddhism. His scholarly approach bridged Eastern and Western academic traditions, making European Indological research accessible to Indian readers while maintaining critical engagement with the source material.

## Source Scholarship

The work draws primarily from three European scholars:

**Moriz Winternitz (1863-1937):** Austrian Indologist whose *Geschichte der indischen Literatur* (History of Indian Literature) provided systematic coverage of Buddhist texts within the broader context of Sanskrit literature.

**Sylvain Lévi (1863-1935):** French Orientalist and pioneering scholar of Sanskrit texts and Nepalese Buddhism, whose work on Buddhist manuscripts significantly advanced understanding of Mahayana literature.

**Eduard Huber (1879-1914):** French scholar specializing in Buddhist literature and Central Asian studies, whose research contributed to understanding the transmission of Buddhist texts.

## Content and Structure

The volume examines:

**Historical Development:** The evolution of Sanskrit as a Buddhist literary language alongside and eventually replacing Pali and Prakrits.

**Major Literary Works:** Systematic coverage of surviving Sanskrit Buddhist texts including sutras, philosophical treatises, and commentarial literature.

**Textual Traditions:** Analysis of how Buddhist literature developed across different schools and regions, particularly the Mahayana traditions that favored Sanskrit.

**Literary Characteristics:** Examination of stylistic features, narrative techniques, and rhetorical strategies employed in Sanskrit Buddhist literature.

## Significance

This work made cutting-edge European Buddhist scholarship accessible to English-speaking Indian audiences at a time when interest in Buddhism was experiencing a revival in India. Nariman's synthesis provided a foundation for understanding the literary dimensions of Sanskrit Buddhism distinct from its philosophical and religious aspects.

## Historical Context

Published in 1923, the work appeared during a period of renewed Indian interest in Buddhism, partly stimulated by figures like Anagarika Dharmapala and scholarly efforts to reclaim India's Buddhist heritage. The compilation method reflects early 20th-century scholarly practices of synthesizing specialized European research for broader audiences.
