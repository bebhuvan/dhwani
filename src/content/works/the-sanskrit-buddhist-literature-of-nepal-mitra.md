# The Sanskrit Buddhist Literature of Nepal

## Overview

Rajendralala Mitra's 1882 survey documented Sanskrit Buddhist manuscripts preserved in Nepal's monastic libraries, particularly in Kathmandu Valley's Newar Buddhist monasteries. This pioneering work identified numerous important Buddhist texts that had disappeared from India following the decline of Buddhism there after the 12th century. Mitra catalogued sutras, tantras, philosophical treatises, and ritual texts representing Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhist traditions, revealing Nepal's crucial role in preserving Sanskrit Buddhist literature. The work established Nepal as an essential source for Buddhist textual studies and stimulated subsequent manuscript collection and scholarly editing of Buddhist texts.

## About Rajendralala Mitra

Rajendralala Mitra (1822-1891) was one of India's first modern scholars of Sanskrit, archaeology, and Buddhist studies. As superintendent of the Asiatic Society of Bengal and later of the Archaeological Survey of India, he pioneered methods combining philological analysis with archaeological evidence. His work on Buddhist manuscripts in Nepal followed research trips identifying and cataloguing previously unknown texts. Mitra's scholarship helped establish Buddhist studies in India and demonstrated Indian scholars' capacity for modern critical scholarship during the colonial period.

## Historical Context

By the 19th century, Buddhism had largely disappeared from India, with texts preserved primarily in Tibet, China, and Japan through translations. Nepal's Newar Buddhist community had maintained unbroken Sanskrit Buddhist traditions and preserved manuscript libraries for centuries. European scholars like Brian Houghton Hodgson had begun identifying these manuscripts' importance in the 1820s-30s. Mitra's survey systematized knowledge of Nepal's collections, making them accessible to international Buddhist scholarship.

## Contents and Methodology

Mitra's survey includes:
- **Bibliographic descriptions**: Titles, colophons, manuscript descriptions
- **Content summaries**: Brief descriptions of texts' subject matter and significance
- **Classification**: Organization by genre (sutra, tantra, philosophy, ritual, etc.)
- **Textual relationships**: Identification of texts known from Tibetan/Chinese translations
- **Historical notes**: Dating, authorship, and transmission history where known
- **Manuscript condition**: Physical descriptions aiding future research

The methodology combined traditional Indian manuscript scholarship with Western philological and bibliographic standards.

## Significance for Buddhist Studies

The survey revealed:
- **Unique texts**: Works surviving only in Nepal's Sanskrit manuscripts
- **Sanskrit originals**: Texts previously known only through translations
- **Tantric literature**: Extensive Vajrayana materials unavailable elsewhere
- **Philosophical works**: Madhyamaka and Yogacara texts in Sanskrit
- **Ritual manuals**: Documents of living Buddhist practice

These discoveries fundamentally altered understanding of Buddhist textual history and made possible critical editions of important philosophical and religious texts.

## Nepal's Role in Preservation

The Newar Buddhist community of Kathmandu Valley maintained:
- **Manuscript libraries**: Monastery collections preserving texts across generations
- **Scribal traditions**: Continuous copying ensuring textual transmission
- **Living traditions**: Ritual and philosophical practices maintaining texts' relevance
- **Cultural continuity**: Unbroken Buddhist practice unlike India's disrupted tradition

Mitra's work recognized and documented this preservation, stimulating respect for Nepal's scholarly and religious contributions.

## Impact and Legacy

The survey influenced:
- **Manuscript collection**: European and Japanese scholars acquiring Nepalese manuscripts
- **Critical editions**: Publication of important Buddhist texts based on Nepalese manuscripts
- **Buddhist studies**: Recognition of Sanskrit texts' importance alongside translations
- **Textual criticism**: Comparative study of Sanskrit originals and translations
- **Cultural heritage**: Appreciation of Nepal's role in Buddhist textual preservation

Modern Buddhist scholarship continues to depend on manuscripts Mitra first documented.

## Subsequent Scholarship

Mitra's survey initiated sustained engagement with Nepal's Buddhist manuscripts. Scholars including Sylvain LÃ©vi, Giuseppe Tucci, and Lokesh Chandra continued cataloguing and editing texts from Nepalese collections. The Nepal-German Manuscript Preservation Project and other digitization initiatives now make these manuscripts accessible globally, fulfilling the scholarly accessibility Mitra's survey pioneered.

## Digital Preservation

This work has been digitized from University of California and other library collections and is freely accessible through the Internet Archive, ensuring continued access to this foundational survey of Sanskrit Buddhist literature and its preservation in Nepal.
