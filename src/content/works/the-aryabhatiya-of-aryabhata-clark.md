# The Aryabhatiya of Aryabhata

## Overview

The Aryabhatiya, composed by mathematician-astronomer Aryabhata in 499 CE at age 23, comprises 121 Sanskrit verses systematically presenting mathematics and astronomy. The work contains four sections: Dasagitika (10 verses on astronomical parameters), Ganitapada (mathematics including arithmetic, algebra, and geometry), Kalakriyapada (time reckoning), and Golapada (spherical astronomy). Aryabhata introduces the place-value decimal system, provides accurate approximations of π (pi), presents methods for extracting square and cube roots, and describes planetary motions including the rotation of the Earth on its axis. Walter Eugene Clark's 1930 edition provides Sanskrit text, English translation, and mathematical commentary contextualizing Aryabhata's methods within the history of mathematics.

## About Aryabhata

Aryabhata (476-550 CE) was an Indian mathematician and astronomer from the classical age of Indian mathematics and science. He established a school of mathematical astronomy that influenced subsequent Indian, Islamic, and European scientific traditions. His statement that the Earth rotates on its axis was remarkable for its era. The Aryabhatiya established conventions for Sanskrit scientific literature and influenced later Indian mathematicians including Bhaskara I, Brahmagupta, and Bhaskara II.

## About Walter Eugene Clark

Walter Eugene Clark (1881-1960) was Professor of Sanskrit at Harvard University and a specialist in Indian mathematics and astronomy. His 1930 translation and edition of the Aryabhatiya, published in the University of Chicago Press series "University of Chicago Studies in Classical Philology," made Aryabhata's work accessible to historians of mathematics and science. Clark's mathematical commentary explains Aryabhata's methods using modern notation while preserving the structure of the original Sanskrit verses.

## Mathematical Content

The Ganitapada (mathematical section) presents:
- **Arithmetic operations**: Including operations with fractions
- **Algebra**: Linear and quadratic equations, arithmetic progressions
- **Geometry**: Areas and volumes of geometric figures
- **Trigonometry**: Sine tables (jya) and trigonometric relationships
- **Square and cube roots**: Algorithms for extraction
- **Value of π**: Approximation as 3.1416 (accurate to four decimal places)

These mathematical tools serve astronomical calculations presented in later sections.

## Astronomical Content

The astronomical sections describe:
- **Planetary models**: Geocentric models with epicycles for planetary motions
- **Earth's rotation**: Statement that the Earth rotates on its axis causing apparent motion of stars
- **Eclipse calculations**: Methods for predicting solar and lunar eclipses
- **Planetary positions**: Algorithms for calculating positions of planets
- **Time reckoning**: Cosmological time units and calendar systems

## Historical Significance

The Aryabhatiya represents a milestone in Indian scientific literature:
- Systematized mathematical and astronomical knowledge
- Influenced Islamic astronomy (transmitted through translations)
- Affected European mathematics through Islamic intermediaries
- Established Sanskrit scientific verse as a medium for technical writing
- Demonstrated sophisticated mathematical techniques including implicit uses of concepts later formalized as calculus

Modern scholars recognize Aryabhata's contributions to mathematics, particularly his understanding of place-value notation and methods for solving equations.

## Clark's Edition

The 1930 edition provides:
- Sanskrit text in Devanagari script with transliteration
- English translation preserving verse structure
- Mathematical commentary explaining techniques
- Historical notes on transmission and influence
- Appendices on Indian astronomical systems

This scholarly apparatus made the Aryabhatiya accessible to historians of science unfamiliar with Sanskrit while preserving the original's technical precision.

## Digital Preservation

Clark's edition has been digitized from University of California and other libraries and is freely accessible through the Internet Archive, ensuring continued access to this foundational work of Indian mathematics and astronomy for scholars studying the history of science, mathematics, and Indian intellectual traditions.
