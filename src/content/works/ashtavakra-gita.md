description: "The Ashtavakra Gita represents Advaita Vedanta's most radical and uncompromising expression, presenting non-dual realization through dialogue between sage Ashtavakra and King Janaka comprising 298 verses of pure non-dualistic teaching. Composed likely between 3rd-8th century CE by unknown author(s), this profound text dispenses with preliminary practices, progressive paths, and conventional morality, directly asserting consciousness as sole reality and immediate recognition as sole requirement for liberation. The sage's uncompromising teaching shocks conventional spirituality: no meditation needed (since who meditates?), no purification required (since consciousness remains untouched), no gradual progress possible (since you already ARE the sought reality), only ignorance prevents realization of ever-present freedom. Beyond negative assertions, the text presents positive vision: consciousness as infinite, peaceful, self-luminous, eternal, and blissfulâ€”not achieved but recognized as always-already present. The work influenced Advaita contemplatives profoundly while proving too radical for popular acceptance, demonstrating non-dualism's most extreme formulation and Advaita's capacity for ruthless logical consistency transcending all conventional frameworks."
