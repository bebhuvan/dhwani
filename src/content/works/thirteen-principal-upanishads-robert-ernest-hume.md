# The Thirteen Principal Upanishads

## Overview

Robert Ernest Hume's 1921 translation presents thirteen key Upanishadsâ€”philosophical texts forming the concluding portion of Vedic literature and the foundation of Vedanta philosophy. The 569-page work, published by Oxford University Press, provides Sanskrit-to-English translations accompanied by philosophical analysis outlining core Upanishadic concepts including Brahman (ultimate reality), Atman (self), karma (action and consequence), and moksha (liberation). The extensive annotated bibliography (pages 459-508) documents scholarly literature on Upanishadic studies, making this both a translation and comprehensive reference work for students and scholars of Indian philosophy.

## About Robert Ernest Hume

Robert Ernest Hume (1877-1948) was an American missionary scholar and professor who taught history of religions at Union Theological Seminary in New York. Born to missionary parents in India, he spent much of his early life there and developed deep familiarity with Sanskrit and Indian philosophical traditions. His translation work combined linguistic expertise with philosophical training, producing accessible yet scholarly renderings of complex Sanskrit philosophical texts. Hume's translation became the standard English-language edition for Upanishadic studies in Western academia throughout much of the 20th century.

## The Principal Upanishads

The Upanishads (meaning "sitting down near" a teacher) represent the final layer of Vedic literature, composed approximately 800-200 BCE. Hume's selection includes the thirteen Upanishads traditionally considered most authoritative:

**Oldest Upanishads (pre-Buddhist):**
- Brihadaranyaka Upanishad
- Chandogya Upanishad

**Middle Period:**
- Taittiriya, Aitareya, Kaushitaki Upanishads

**Later Classical Period:**
- Kena, Katha, Isha, Mundaka, Prashna, Mandukya, Svetasvatara, Maitri Upanishads

These texts mark the transition from ritualistic Vedic religion to philosophical inquiry, introducing concepts that became central to Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain thought.

## Philosophical Content

The Upanishads explore fundamental questions through dialogues between teachers and students, often employing metaphor, paradox, and meditation instructions. Key philosophical themes include:

- **Brahman-Atman identity**: The ultimate reality (Brahman) and individual self (Atman) are identical
- **Maya**: The illusory nature of phenomenal reality
- **Karma and Samsara**: Action's consequences and the cycle of rebirth
- **Moksha**: Liberation from the cycle of rebirth through knowledge
- **Meditation practices**: Techniques for realizing philosophical truths

The texts employ various literary forms including narrative, dialogue, ritual instruction, and poetry.

## Translation Methodology

Hume's translation approach balanced literal accuracy with philosophical clarity. He consulted multiple Sanskrit commentaries, particularly those of Shankara (8th century CE), whose Advaita Vedanta interpretation significantly influenced subsequent Upanishadic understanding. The work includes:

- Sanskrit transliterations for key terms
- Verse-by-verse annotations explaining philosophical concepts
- Cross-references between Upanishads showing doctrinal development
- Comparative notes on variant readings and interpretations
- Bibliography documenting Western and Indian scholarship

## Scholarly Context

Published in 1921 as the history of religions emerged as an academic discipline, Hume's work represented American scholarly engagement with Asian philosophy during a period of growing Western interest in comparative religion. The translation drew on 19th-century German Indological scholarship while making Upanishadic philosophy accessible to English-speaking students without requiring Sanskrit knowledge. The work influenced subsequent philosophical and religious studies scholars including Mircea Eliade, Heinrich Zimmer, and early comparative philosophers.

## Annotated Bibliography

Pages 459-508 provide a comprehensive annotated bibliography of Upanishadic studies, including:
- Sanskrit editions and commentaries
- European translations (German, French, English)
- Philosophical studies and comparative analyses
- Related Vedic and Vedantic literature
- Critical scholarship on textual history and dating

This bibliographic apparatus made the volume essential for research libraries and graduate programs in philosophy, religious studies, and South Asian studies.

## Historical Significance

Hume's translation shaped Western understanding of Hindu philosophy for several generations. While subsequent scholars have produced more literal or philologically sophisticated translations, Hume's work remains valued for its philosophical clarity and comprehensive scope. The translation influenced mid-20th-century American interest in Asian philosophy, contributing to the inclusion of Indian philosophy in comparative philosophy curricula and supporting the emergence of cross-cultural philosophical dialogue.

## Digital Preservation

This 569-page Oxford University Press edition has been digitized from University of California libraries and is freely accessible through the Internet Archive, ensuring continued availability of this influential translation to contemporary students and scholars of Indian philosophy, comparative religion, and Asian studies.
