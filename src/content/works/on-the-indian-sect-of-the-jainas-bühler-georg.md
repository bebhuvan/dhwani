description: '"On the Indian Sect of the Jainas" by Georg Bühler is a scholarly work
  published in the early 20th century that explores the Jaina religion and its historical
  significance in India. The book delves into the doctrines, customs, and community
  structures of the Jaina sect, drawing parallels to Buddhism while also highlighting
  its distinct features and rich cultural heritage. Bühler''s analysis aims to shed
  light on a religious society that, despite its importance, remains relatively less
  understood or accessible, particularly among educated Indians who may not be familiar
  with European languages.  The opening of the work serves as a preface outlining
  the author''s intention and the translation''s significance to both European scholars
  and educated Indians. It discusses the historical context of the Jaina sect, emphasizing
  its foundation during the same period as Buddhism and its divergence from Brahmanism.
  Bühler introduces key concepts such as the two major divisions within Jainism -
  the Digambara and Śvetāmbara sects, along with their respective practices and beliefs.
  The detailed exploration of Jaina mythology and the emphasis on the sect’s unique
  principles sets the stage for a deeper understanding of Jainism as a rich philosophical
  and ethical framework rooted in the quest for spiritual liberation.'
