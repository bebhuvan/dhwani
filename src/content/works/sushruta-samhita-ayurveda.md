description: "The Sushruta Samhita represents ancient India's supreme surgical treatise and one of foundational Ayurveda texts, systematizing surgical knowledge through approximately 1,120 verses and detailed descriptions of 300+ surgical procedures, 120+ surgical instruments, and comprehensive medical training. Composed around 6th century BCE with later additions, this monumental work of six sthanas (sections) covers: general principles, pathology, diagnosis, therapeutics, and specialized surgery including pioneering rhinoplasty (nasal reconstruction), cataract surgery, lithotomy, and obstetrics. Beyond surgical techniques, Sushruta presents sophisticated medical philosophy: tridosha theory (three humors regulating health), detailed anatomy based on dissection, pharmacology with 700+ medicinal substances, medical ethics, and physician training requiring extensive theoretical study, practical apprenticeship, and surgical practice on models before treating patients. The text influenced Indian, Arabic, and through them European medicine, demonstrating ancient India's advanced surgical knowledge rivaling any contemporary civilization while establishing professional medical standards and ethical principles enduring into modern practice."
