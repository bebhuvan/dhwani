description: '"Recollections of Calcutta for over Half a Century" by Montague Massey
  is a historical account likely written in the early 20th century. The book provides
  a personal narrative and reflection on the changes in Calcutta from the 1860s onward,
  particularly in terms of societal structures, urban developments, and personal experiences
  of the author amid the backdrop of the evolving city.   At the start of the book,
  Massey introduces his memoirs by clarifying that they will not include sensational
  tales but will instead focus on his observations of Calcutta''s transformation over
  many years. He recalls his early days in the city with vivid descriptions of social
  life, transportation during his time with "palkis" and "bund-gharries," and the
  exclusive social circles among the European community. Through anecdotes about events
  such as state balls at Government House and the introduction of professional theatricals,
  he sets the stage for a rich tapestry of personal and historical insights that will
  illustrate the essence of Calcutta as he remembers it.'
