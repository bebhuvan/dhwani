# Ancient India, 2000 B.C.-800 A.D.

## Overview

Romesh Chunder Dutt's *Ancient India, 2000 B.C.-800 A.D.* (1904) presents a comprehensive historical survey of three millennia of Indian civilization, from the Vedic period through the decline of the Gupta Empire. This 196-page volume, published by Longmans, Green in London and New York, offers a unique perspective: it was written by an Indian scholar-administrator who combined firsthand knowledge of India with Western historical methodologies.

## The Author

Romesh Chunder Dutt (1848-1909) was a pioneering figure in modern Indian intellectual and political life:

**Administrative Career:** First Indian to be appointed divisional commissioner in the Indian Civil Service, serving in Bengal and other regions.

**Political Leadership:** Elected president of the Indian National Congress in 1899, contributing to the early nationalist movement.

**Literary Achievements:** Renowned for his English verse translations of the *Ramayana* and *Mahabharata*, which introduced these epics to Western readers in accessible poetic form.

**Economic Thought:** An important theorist of Indian economic nationalism, Dutt analyzed the economic impact of British rule and advocated for Indian industrial development.

## Historical Coverage

The work divides ancient Indian history into two major periods:

### Pre-Mauryan India (2000-324 B.C.)

**Vedic Age:** Examination of Aryan migrations, the composition of the Vedas, and the development of early Vedic society and religion.

**Brahmanic Period:** The rise of the Brahmanical social order, the codification of the varna system, and the emergence of complex ritual practices.

**Buddhist Revolution:** The life of Buddha, the origins and spread of Buddhism, and its challenge to Brahmanical orthodoxy.

**Pre-Mauryan Kingdoms:** Political formations including the sixteen Mahajanapadas, the rise of Magadha, and the impact of Persian and Greek invasions.

### Classical Age (324 B.C.-800 A.D.)

**Mauryan Empire:** Chandragupta's consolidation, Ashoka's reign and Buddhist patronage, and the empire's decline.

**Post-Mauryan Period:** The Shunga and Kanva dynasties, Indo-Greek kingdoms, Kushana Empire, and the Satavahana dynasty in the Deccan.

**Gupta Golden Age:** Chandragupta I, Samudragupta's conquests, Chandragupta II Vikramaditya's cultural patronage, and the flowering of Sanskrit literature, art, and science.

**Post-Gupta Decline:** The Hun invasions, regional kingdoms, and the fragmentation of political power through 800 A.D.

## Methodological Approach

Dutt's historical method combined:

**Textual Analysis:** Drawing on Sanskrit sources, Buddhist chronicles, and Puranic traditions while critically assessing their historical value.

**Archaeological Evidence:** Incorporating findings from early archaeological work, inscriptions, and numismatic evidence.

**Administrative Insight:** His civil service experience informed his understanding of governance structures, revenue systems, and administrative institutions.

**Comparative Perspective:** Contextualizing Indian developments alongside contemporary civilizations, particularly regarding political institutions and cultural achievements.

## Distinctive Features

**Indian Perspective:** Unlike most contemporary historical works written by British scholars, Dutt brought an Indian sensibility and deeper cultural understanding to his analysis.

**Balanced Treatment:** While nationalist in sympathy, Dutt maintained scholarly objectivity, neither romanticizing ancient India nor uncritically accepting colonial historical frameworks.

**Economic Analysis:** Unusual for ancient history of this period, Dutt paid attention to economic structures, trade networks, and material conditions.

**Cultural Continuity:** Emphasized themes of cultural continuity across political changes, showing how Indian civilization maintained coherence despite dynastic transitions.

## Significance

This work holds multiple levels of significance:

**Scholarly Contribution:** Provided an authoritative synthesis of ancient Indian history accessible to general English-speaking readers.

**Nationalist Discourse:** Contributed to growing Indian self-awareness by presenting India's civilizational achievements before British rule, important for the nationalist movement.

**Historiographical Importance:** Represented early Indian historical writing in English, demonstrating that Indians could produce scholarship meeting Western academic standards while bringing indigenous perspectives.

**Literary Merit:** Dutt's clear prose and narrative skill made ancient history engaging for non-specialist readers.

## Historical Context

Published in 1904, the work appeared during:

- Growing Indian nationalist consciousness
- Archaeological discoveries (like those at Harappa would come later) beginning to reshape understanding of Indian antiquity
- Debates about India's fitness for self-governance, where historical achievements became political arguments
- Emergence of Indian scholarship challenging colonial historical narratives

## Limitations

As a product of its time, the work reflects:

- Limited archaeological data compared to later 20th-century discoveries
- Acceptance of the Aryan migration theory in its then-current form
- Reliance on textual sources whose dates were imprecisely known
- Absence of Harappan civilization, not yet discovered

Despite these limitations, the work's fundamental insights and narrative structure remain valuable.

## Legacy

Dutt's historical writing influenced:

- Subsequent Indian nationalist historians
- Popular understanding of ancient India among educated Indians
- The development of Indian historical writing in English
- Debates about how to interpret India's past in relation to its political future

## How to Access

Available through Internet Archive as a digitized scan from the University of California Libraries collection. Public domain, freely accessible for research and education. Remains valuable both as historical scholarship and as an artifact of early Indian nationalist historiography.
