description: "Harsha's Ratnavali represents Sanskrit drama's finest romantic comedy, a four-act natika (minor drama) featuring mistaken identity, disguise, and intrigue revolving around Princess Ratnavali's love for King Udayana. Composed by Emperor Harshavardhana during his remarkable reign (606-647 CE) when he balanced statecraft with literary creation, this sophisticated comedy transforms folk narrative about Udayana's romantic entanglements into elegant theater demonstrating the erotic (shringara) and comic (hasya) rasas. The plot centers on King Udayana of Kaushambi, already married to Queen Vasavadatta, whose minister arranges his marriage to Ratnavali, princess of Simhala (Ceylon), to strengthen political alliances. When Ratnavali arrives shipwrecked and disguised as the maid Sagarika, Udayana falls in love unknowingly with his betrothed, creating delightful dramatic irony. Through clever manipulation by the vidushaka (jester) Vasantaka and chamberlain Yaugandharayana, involving a portrait, a pearl necklace, jealousy, disguise, and eventual revelation, the play resolves with Udayana's polygamous marriage to both queens. Beyond its entertaining surface, Ratnavali demonstrates Harsha's dramatic craftsmanship: witty dialogue, intricate plotting, psychological insight into jealousy and desire, and sophisticated use of mistaken identity conventions while exploring themes of beauty, love at first sight versus arranged marriage, and courtly intrigue. The play influenced later romantic comedies throughout Indian dramatic literature and reveals the Gupta-Harsha period's theatrical sophistication."
