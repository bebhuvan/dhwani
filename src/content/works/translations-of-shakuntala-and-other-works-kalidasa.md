description: |
  This volume collects English translations of works by Kalidasa (fl. 4th-5th century CE), widely considered Sanskrit drama and poetry's supreme master, with particular emphasis on his masterpiece Abhijnanasakuntalam (The Recognition of Shakuntala). The play tells the story of King Dushyanta's love for Shakuntala, their separation through a curse-induced amnesia, and eventual reunion through recognition, combining romance, divine intervention, and philosophical meditation on memory, desire, and dharmic duty. Kalidasa's work exemplifies classical Sanskrit kavya (courtly literature) at its peak, featuring elaborate poetic ornamentation (alamkara), sophisticated metrical variety, and profound integration of shringar rasa (erotic sentiment) with deeper spiritual themes. European discovery of Shakuntala in late eighteenth century—first through Sir William Jones's 1789 translation—profoundly impacted Romantic literature; Goethe famously praised the play, and it influenced European conceptions of Indian civilization as possessing sophisticated aesthetic and philosophical traditions. Multiple English translations attempt to capture Kalidasa's linguistic virtuosity, his skillful mixture of Sanskrit verse and Prakrit prose (marking social hierarchies through language register), and his mastery of rasa theory (aesthetic emotion). The volume likely includes other Kalidasa works such as Meghaduta (Cloud Messenger), a lyric poem in which a yaksha (nature spirit) sends messages to his beloved via a cloud, showcasing the poet's unparalleled ability to fuse landscape description with emotional expression. Translations of Kalidasa inevitably lose the original's intricate wordplay, metrical sophistication, and cultural resonances while attempting to convey the universal emotional truth and philosophical depth that have sustained the works' canonical status across centuries and civilizational boundaries.
