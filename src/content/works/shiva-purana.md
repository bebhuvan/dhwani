description: "The Shiva Purana stands as one of eighteen Mahapuranas and the foremost Shaiva text, presenting comprehensive theology, mythology, and ritual practice centered on Shiva as supreme deity. Composed between 10th-14th centuries CE (with core material likely around 1000 CE), this work encompasses approximately 24,000 verses across seven samhitas (collections) covering: Shiva's cosmic functions as creator-preserver-destroyer transcending the Trimurti, elaborate descriptions of Shiva's multiple forms and manifestations including Rudra, Bhairava, and Nataraja, systematic exposition of linga worship as symbol of formless absolute, creation cosmology and dissolution cycles, sacred geography of pilgrimage sites (tirthas) and Jyotirlingas, narratives of Shiva's marriage to Parvati and family mythology, and teachings on Shaiva yoga and devotional paths to liberation. The text synthesizes Vedic Rudra traditions, Tantric practices, and bhakti devotionalism, establishing theological foundations for diverse Shaiva sampradayas across India. The Shiva Purana's influence on Hindu iconography, temple architecture, ritual practice, and philosophical theology remains profound, providing narrative and doctrinal frameworks that shaped Shaivism's development from medieval through modern periods."
