description: "Bhartrhari's three Shatakas—Niti Shataka (century on ethics), Shringara Shataka (century on love), and Vairagya Shataka (century on renunciation)—represent Sanskrit gnomic poetry's supreme achievement, comprising approximately 300 verses exploring life's fundamental tensions between worldly engagement and spiritual detachment. Composed around 5th century CE, these aphoristic poems address: political wisdom and human nature (Niti), erotic love and beauty's transience (Shringara), and world-weariness culminating in renunciation (Vairagya). Each verse stands as complete meditative unit, employing vivid imagery, paradox, and psychological insight to capture universal human experiences. The progression from ethics through passion to detachment reflects Hindu life-stage ideals yet acknowledges their tensions. Bhartrhari's poetic genius appears in combining philosophical depth with accessible language, Sanskrit classical meters with proverbial wisdom, and personal authenticity (legend claims he alternated between court and monastery) with universal themes. K. Trimbak Telang's translation introduced these masterworks to English readers, revealing Sanskrit poetry's capacity for philosophical verse rivaling Persian ghazals or English metaphysical poetry."
