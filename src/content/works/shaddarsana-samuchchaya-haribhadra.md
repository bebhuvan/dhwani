Demonstrates Jain doctrine of anekantavada (non-absolutism) through sympathetic exposition of each system before showing how Jainism synthesizes and transcends them.

# Ṣaḍdarśana-samuccaya (Compendium of Six Philosophical Systems)

## Overview

The Ṣaḍdarśana-samuccaya is Haribhadra Suri's (8th century CE) landmark comparative philosophical work examining six major Indian philosophical systems from a Jain perspective. This 320-page 1905 edition (Asiatic Society) represents Jain intellectual engagement with rival schools at its sophisticated best, demonstrating the principle of anekantavada (non-absolutist perspective) through fair presentation and critical analysis.

## Content & Significance

Haribhadra revolutionized philosophical discourse by presenting each system sympathetically before critique—covering Buddhist, Nyaya, Samkhya, Jaina, Vaisheshika, and Mimamsa schools. The work demonstrates how Jainism's pluralistic epistemology (syadvada) can accommodate partial truths from multiple perspectives while transcending them. Essential for understanding medieval Indian philosophical debates and Jain intellectual history. Available through Archive.org (DLI collection), public domain.
