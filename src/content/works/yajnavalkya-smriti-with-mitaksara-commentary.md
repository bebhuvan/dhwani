# Yājñavalkya Smṛti with the Commentary Mitākṣarā

## Overview

The Yājñavalkya Smṛti is one of the most significant legal texts (dharmaśāstra) in Hindu jurisprudence, traditionally attributed to the sage Yājñavalkya. This foundational work on Hindu law, composed between the 3rd and 5th centuries CE, systematically covers civil law, criminal law, court procedures, and religious duties. The text gained immense authority through Vijñāneśvara's 12th-century commentary called Mitākṣarā, which became the definitive interpretation of Hindu law, particularly influencing inheritance and property rights across much of India.

This digital collection presents two important scholarly editions: the **Pansikar Edition** featuring the original Sanskrit text with Vijñāneśvara's Mitākṣarā commentary, and the **Vidyarnava Translation** providing an English rendering with extensive notes and commentary by Srisa Chandra Vidyarnava.

## About the Authors and Commentators

### Yājñavalkya
**Yājñavalkya** is a revered sage in Hindu tradition, traditionally credited as one of the great lawgivers of ancient India. While the historical Yājñavalkya appears in the Upanishads as a philosopher, the legal text bearing his name represents a later compilation of dharmaśāstra principles. The Smṛti attributed to him is considered one of the three most authoritative law codes, alongside those of Manu and Parāśara.

### Vijñāneśvara
**Vijñāneśvara** (11th-12th century CE) was a brilliant jurist and commentator who served in the court of the Chalukya king Vikramāditya VI. His commentary, the Mitākṣarā (meaning "the measured word"), transformed the Yājñavalkya Smṛti from one legal text among many into the primary source of Hindu law. The Mitākṣarā school of Hindu law, derived from his interpretations, became dominant across most of India.

### Wasudev Laxman Shastri Pansikar
**Wasudev Laxman Shastri Pansikar** was a renowned Sanskrit scholar and editor who played a crucial role in making classical Sanskrit texts available in reliable, scholarly editions. His editorial work on the Yājñavalkya Smṛti with Mitākṣarā commentary represents meticulous scholarship in preserving and presenting ancient legal texts with accuracy and scholarly apparatus.

### Srisa Chandra Vidyarnava
**Srisa Chandra Vidyarnava** was a distinguished Bengali scholar and translator who made Sanskrit legal texts accessible to English-speaking audiences during the colonial period. His translation preserves the technical precision of the original while making the complex legal concepts comprehensible to modern readers.

## Historical Context

The Yājñavalkya Smṛti was composed during a period when Hindu society was developing sophisticated legal and social institutions. The text represents an evolution from earlier Vedic legal concepts toward more systematic jurisprudence. Vijñāneśvara's Mitākṣarā commentary, written during the Chalukya period (11th-12th centuries), came at a time when regional kingdoms needed standardized legal interpretations for governance and administration.

## Structure and Content

The Yājñavalkya Smṛti is organized into three books (adhyāyas):

### 1. Ācāra (Conduct and Religious Duties)
- Daily observances and rituals
- Life-stage duties (āśrama dharma)
- Social obligations and moral conduct
- Religious festivals and ceremonies

### 2. Vyavahāra (Civil and Criminal Law)
- Court procedures and legal processes
- Evidence and witnesses
- Contracts and commercial law
- Property rights and inheritance
- Marriage and family law
- Criminal offenses and punishments

### 3. Prāyaścitta (Atonement and Penance)
- Religious penances for various sins
- Purification rituals
- Restoration to social status
- Spiritual remedies for moral transgressions

## The Mitākṣarā Commentary

Vijñāneśvara's Mitākṣarā commentary is remarkable for several reasons:

### Legal Innovation
- **Systematic Interpretation**: Provides consistent legal principles across different topics
- **Property Law**: Developed sophisticated concepts of inheritance, particularly the **coparcenary** system
- **Judicial Procedure**: Clarified court processes and rules of evidence
- **Commercial Law**: Addressed trade, contracts, and economic relationships

### Intellectual Achievement
- **Philosophical Depth**: Integrates legal principles with dharmic philosophy
- **Practical Application**: Balances theoretical ideals with practical governance needs
- **Comparative Analysis**: References other legal authorities while establishing precedent
- **Linguistic Precision**: Uses technical legal terminology with remarkable clarity

## Key Legal Contributions

### Inheritance Law
The Mitākṣarā's interpretation of inheritance became foundational:
- **Joint Family Property**: Established principles for undivided family property
- **Succession Rights**: Defined inheritance rights for sons, grandsons, and other heirs
- **Women's Property Rights**: Addressed female inheritance, though within traditional frameworks
- **Adoption**: Regulated adoption practices and inheritance through adopted sons

### Commercial Law
The text addressed emerging commercial needs:
- **Contract Law**: Principles for valid agreements and their enforcement
- **Partnership**: Rules for business partnerships and profit-sharing
- **Interest and Loans**: Regulation of moneylending and debt recovery
- **Trade Disputes**: Procedures for resolving commercial conflicts

### Criminal Justice
Advanced concepts of criminal law:
- **Proportional Punishment**: Penalties appropriate to the crime and criminal's status
- **Evidence Standards**: Requirements for witness testimony and proof
- **Royal Duty**: The king's obligation to protect subjects and maintain justice
- **Compensation**: Restoration and restitution alongside punishment

## Historical Influence

### Legal Systems
- **Colonial Period**: British administrators used Mitākṣarā interpretations for personal law
- **Modern India**: Influenced contemporary Hindu personal law codes
- **Regional Variation**: Mitākṣarā school dominated most of India except Bengal (Dāyabhāga school)
- **Judicial Precedent**: Established legal principles still referenced in Indian courts

### Scholarly Tradition

- **Educational Curriculum**: Became standard text in traditional legal education
- **Cross-referencing**: Influenced other dharmaśāstra compilations and interpretations
- **Comparative Jurisprudence**: Provided Indian legal concepts for comparative legal studies
