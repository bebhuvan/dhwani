# The Bhagavad Gita

## Overview

This 1899 English translation of the Bhagavad Gita, published by the Christian Literature Society for India in London and Madras, provides a 114-page rendering of the foundational Hindu philosophical text with explanatory notes and systematic examination of its doctrines. The Bhagavad Gita (Song of the Lord) comprises 700 Sanskrit verses forming chapters 23-40 of the Bhishma Parva in the Mahabharata epic. The text presents a dialogue between Prince Arjuna and Lord Krishna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, addressing fundamental questions of duty (dharma), action (karma), devotion (bhakti), and the paths to spiritual realization.

## The Bhagavad Gita: Historical Context

Composed between approximately 400 BCE and 200 CE, the Bhagavad Gita synthesizes earlier Upanishadic philosophy with emerging devotional (bhakti) movements and practical ethics. Set within the Mahabharata's narrative of civil war between the Pandavas and Kauravas, the text addresses Arjuna's moral crisis as he faces relatives and teachers in battle. Krishna's discourse transcends the immediate military situation to explore universal philosophical questions about duty, action, knowledge, and devotion.

## Philosophical Structure

The Gita's 18 chapters systematically present complementary paths to spiritual realization:

**Chapters 1-6: Karma Yoga (Path of Action)**
- Chapter 1: Arjuna's despair and moral paralysis
- Chapter 2: Sankhya philosophy and nature of the eternal self
- Chapters 3-5: Selfless action and renunciation
- Chapter 6: Meditation and self-control

**Chapters 7-12: Bhakti Yoga (Path of Devotion)**
- Chapters 7-9: Krishna's divine nature and manifestations
- Chapter 10: Divine manifestations in the world
- Chapter 11: Krishna's universal form (Vishvarupa)
- Chapter 12: Devotion to the personal God

**Chapters 13-18: Jnana Yoga (Path of Knowledge)**
- Chapters 13-15: Distinction between body and soul, nature and spirit
- Chapter 16: Divine and demonic natures
- Chapter 17: Classification of faith and action
- Chapter 18: Synthesis of paths and final teaching

## Core Philosophical Teachings

**The Nature of the Self:**
Krishna teaches that the true self (Atman) is eternal, unchanging, and distinct from the physical body. Death affects only the body; the self transmigrates according to karma.

**Dharma and Righteous Action:**
One must perform one's duty (svadharma) according to one's social position and life stage, but with detachment from results. Action performed as an offering to the divine, without attachment to outcomes, leads to liberation.

**Three Paths to Liberation:**
- Karma Yoga: Selfless action
- Bhakti Yoga: Loving devotion to God
- Jnana Yoga: Philosophical knowledge and discrimination

The Gita presents these paths as complementary rather than exclusive, offering multiple approaches suited to different temperaments.

**The Nature of Reality:**
Reality consists of Prakriti (nature/matter) and Purusha (consciousness/spirit). Understanding their distinction and relationship leads to wisdom.

## Influence and Reception

The Bhagavad Gita became central to Hindu philosophical and devotional traditions, receiving commentaries from major philosophers including Shankara (8th century, Advaita Vedanta), Ramanuja (11th century, Vishishtadvaita), and Madhva (13th century, Dvaita Vedanta). Each interpreted the text according to their philosophical systems, demonstrating its doctrinal flexibility.

Modern Indian leaders including Mahatma Gandhi, who called it his "spiritual dictionary," and Bal Gangadhar Tilak interpreted the Gita to support social and political activism. Gandhi emphasized its teaching of selfless action as justification for social service and non-violent resistance.

## This 1899 Edition

Published by the Christian Literature Society for India, this edition reflects late 19th-century missionary engagement with Hindu philosophy. The Society published translations of Hindu and Buddhist texts for comparative religious study, often including Christian theological perspectives in introductions and notes. This translation made the Gita accessible to English-speaking audiences in India and Britain during a period of growing Western interest in Indian philosophy.

The edition includes:
- Complete English translation of all 18 chapters
- Explanatory notes on philosophical concepts and Sanskrit terms
- Systematic examination of the Gita's doctrines
- Contextual information on the text's place within the Mahabharata

## Scholarly Significance

This translation represents one of many late 19th-century English renderings that introduced the Bhagavad Gita to Western audiences. While earlier translations by Charles Wilkins (1785) and Edwin Arnold's "Song Celestial" (1885) preceded it, the proliferation of translations reflected growing recognition of the Gita's philosophical importance. The explanatory apparatus in this edition attempted to make Hindu philosophical concepts comprehensible to readers unfamiliar with Sanskrit thought.

## Digital Preservation

This 114-page work has been digitized and is freely accessible through the Internet Archive, providing contemporary readers and scholars access to this late 19th-century English translation representing early Western engagement with Hindu philosophical literature.
