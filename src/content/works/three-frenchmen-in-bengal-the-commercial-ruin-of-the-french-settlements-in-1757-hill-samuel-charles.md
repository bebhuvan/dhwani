  Samuel Charles Hill's "Three Frenchmen in Bengal" examines the French East India Company's commercial and political collapse in Bengal during the pivotal year 1757, when British victory at Plassey established East India Company dominance and effectively ended French aspirations for territorial power in eastern India. The work draws on French company records, private correspondence, and commercial documentation to reconstruct the perspective of French merchants and administrators witnessing their enterprise's destruction through British military and diplomatic action. Hill's focus on individual Frenchmen's experiences humanizes the larger geopolitical struggle while documenting the commercial rivalry between European trading companies that preceded and enabled territorial conquest. The 1757 crisis represented culmination of decades of Anglo-French competition in India, with both companies building military forces, forming alliances with Indian rulers, and intervening in regional politics to secure commercial advantages and exclude rivals. French defeat in Bengal resulted partly from material disadvantages—weaker naval power, less robust metropolitan support, smaller European garrison—and partly from diplomatic failures and poor strategic choices by company officials on the ground. Hill's account provides detailed documentation of commercial operations, treaty negotiations, and company administration, offering insights into European trading company operations in eighteenth-century India and the mechanisms through which commercial rivalry escalated into military conflict. The work illuminates how European imperial competition played out in Indian contexts, with both French and British companies dependent on Indian allies, labor, and commercial networks even as they competed for monopolistic control. By focusing on French perspective and experience, Hill's work complicates triumphalist British narratives of inevitable supremacy, showing French defeat as contingent outcome of specific political and military developments rather than natural British superiority. As historical source, the work documents the broader European scramble for Indian commerce and territory while revealing how that competition appeared to participants—as uncertain, fraught, dependent on Indian political dynamics that European actors could influence but never fully control.
