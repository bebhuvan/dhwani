description: "James Legge's 1886 translation of Chinese Buddhist monk Faxian's 5th-century pilgrimage narrative traces Buddhist sacred sites across Central Asia, India, and Southeast Asia. Faxian's observations of Gupta-era India, Buddhist monasteries, relic veneration, and regional practices provide invaluable historical documentation of Indian Buddhism's flourishing period, complementing indigenous sources with outsider perspective documenting pilgrimage routes and religious life."

# A Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms

## Overview
Among the earliest eyewitness accounts of the Buddhist world, Faxian’s travelogue recounts his journey from China through Gandhara, Magadha, and Lanka between 399 and 414 CE. James Legge’s 1886 Oxford edition translates the narrative, prints the Chinese text, and supplies historical notes that situate monasteries, stupas, and scriptural collections encountered along the route.

## Highlights
Legge annotates Faxian’s descriptions of the Mahabodhi Temple, the relics of the Buddha at Peshawar, and monastic life in Anuradhapura. Extensive appendices compare Sanskrit and Chinese textual traditions, identify place names via contemporary archaeology, and include maps reflecting 19th-century scholarship on Buddhist geography.

## Access Notes
The Internet Archive version retains Legge’s bilingual layout and scholarly apparatus, with searchable text that aids researchers tracing specific pilgrimage sites or comparing variants across Buddhist canons.
