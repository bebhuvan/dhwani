  James Legge's 1886 translation of Faxian's pilgrim narrative represents a
  seminal textual artifact documenting the complex religious and cultural
  landscapes of late classical Indian Buddhism during the transitional period of
  the late Gupta era (399-412 CE). Faxian, a Chinese Buddhist monk, undertook an
  extraordinary transcontinental journey traversing Central Asia, India, and
  Southeast Asia, meticulously documenting Buddhist monastic institutions,
  philosophical practices, regional religious variations, and sacred sites.

## Historical Context

James Legge's 1886 translation of Faxian's pilgrim narrative represents a seminal textual artifact documenting the complex religious and cultural landscapes of late classical Indian Buddhism during the transitional period of the late Gupta era (399-412 CE). Faxian, a Chinese Buddhist monk, undertook an extraordinary transcontinental journey traversing Central Asia, India, and Southeast Asia, meticulously documenting Buddhist monastic institutions, philosophical practices, regional religious variations, and sacred sites. His account emerges during a critical historical moment when Buddhism was experiencing profound philosophical and institutional transformations, simultaneously reflecting the cosmopolitan intellectual networks that characterized transnational Buddhist scholarship. The text provides nuanced ethnographic observations of monastic infrastructure, ritual practices, philosophical debates, and the intricate social ecosystems surrounding Buddhist institutions across diverse regional contexts. Particularly significant are Faxian's detailed descriptions of monastery architectures, educational systems, relic veneration practices, and the complex interactions between Buddhist communities and broader social structures of the period. His perspective as a foreign scholar offers a unique outsider's lens on Indian religious life, complementing and challenging indigenous textual sources by providing comparative insights into Buddhist practice, transmission, and cultural adaptation. The work is methodologically groundbreaking, representing one of the earliest sustained cross-cultural scholarly documentations of Indian Buddhist civilization, offering unprecedented anthropological and historical documentation of a pivotal transitional period in South Asian religious history. Legge's precise translation further amplifies the text's scholarly significance, rendering this complex historical document accessible to broader academic discourse and preserving a critical window into the intellectual and spiritual dynamics of classical Indian Buddhism.

# A Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms

## Overview
Among the earliest eyewitness accounts of the Buddhist world, Faxian’s travelogue recounts his journey from China through Gandhara, Magadha, and Lanka between 399 and 414 CE. James Legge’s 1886 Oxford edition translates the narrative, prints the Chinese text, and supplies historical notes that situate monasteries, stupas, and scriptural collections encountered along the route.

## Highlights
Legge annotates Faxian’s descriptions of the Mahabodhi Temple, the relics of the Buddha at Peshawar, and monastic life in Anuradhapura. Extensive appendices compare Sanskrit and Chinese textual traditions, identify place names via contemporary archaeology, and include maps reflecting 19th-century scholarship on Buddhist geography.

## Access Notes
The Internet Archive version retains Legge’s bilingual layout and scholarly apparatus, with searchable text that aids researchers tracing specific pilgrimage sites or comparing variants across Buddhist canons.
