description: "Critical Pali edition of philosophical dialogues between Indo-Greek King Milinda (Menander I, 2nd century BCE) and Buddhist monk N캐gasena, representing unique encounter between Greek dialectical tradition and Buddhist thought. Addresses fundamental Buddhist doctrines including no-self (anatta), karma, rebirth, and enlightenment through sophisticated question-and-answer format reminiscent of Platonic dialogues. Trenckner's 1880 edition made this important text accessible to Western scholars studying cross-cultural philosophical exchange."
