  Kautilya's Arthashastra, translated into Hindi by scholars Vidya Bhashker and Professor Udayabeer Shastri in 1925, represents a critical preservation of classical Indian political philosophy during the late colonial period. Composed around 300 BCE during the Mauryan Empire, the original Sanskrit text is a comprehensive treatise on statecraft, economic administration, and strategic governance, attributed to the influential advisor Chanakya (also known as Kautilya). This 1925 Hindi translation emerged at a pivotal moment in Indian intellectual history, when scholars were actively recuperating and reinterpreting ancient texts to articulate indigenous political and administrative knowledge systems. The translated work comprises fifteen books covering diverse domains including state administration, diplomatic strategies, military organization, economic policy, legal frameworks, and social management. By rendering this complex text accessible to Hindi-speaking scholars and intellectuals, Bhashker and Shastri facilitated broader engagement with classical Indian political thought during a period of intense national self-reflection and emerging independence movements. The Arthashastra offers profound insights into sophisticated pre-colonial governance mechanisms, challenging colonial narratives about Indian administrative capabilities. Its systematic exploration of state craft, economic principles, and ethical governance demonstrates the advanced theoretical and practical understanding of political science in ancient Indian civilization. This translation significantly contributed to scholarly discourse by making Kautilya's nuanced perspectives on statecraft, economic management, and diplomatic strategy available to a wider intellectual audience, thus reinforcing the intellectual heritage of Indian political philosophy during a transformative historical period.

# Kautilya Arthashastra Hindi Anubad

## Publication History and Context

This 1925 Hindi translation of Kautilya's Arthashastra represents a landmark achievement in making ancient Indian political philosophy accessible to Hindi-speaking audiences during a pivotal period in India's intellectual and political awakening. Published just two decades after R. Shamasastry's dramatic 1905 rediscovery of the long-lost Sanskrit manuscript in Mysore and a decade after his pioneering 1915 English translation, the Bhashker-Shastri Hindi edition emerged at a crucial historical juncture when Indian scholars were actively reclaiming indigenous intellectual traditions and making them available in modern Indian languages.

The publication appeared during the height of British colonial rule, when the Hindi language movement (Hindi Sahitya Sammelan and related initiatives) was gaining momentum as part of the broader cultural nationalism sweeping India. Translating the Arthashastra into Hindi served multiple objectives: demonstrating the sophistication of ancient Indian political thought to counter colonial narratives of Indian intellectual inferiority, providing educational materials for emerging Indian universities where Hindi was increasingly used, and connecting contemporary political debates about self-governance to indigenous traditions of statecraft. The timing was particularly significant given the rise of Swaraj (self-rule) movements led by figures like Mahatma Gandhi and the concurrent search for authentically Indian models of governance and political organization.

The 1925 publication was likely produced in the context of growing interest in the Arthashastra following Shamasastry's sensational rediscovery, which had revealed that ancient India possessed political theory comparable to Machiavelli but predating him by nearly two millennia. Max Weber's famous 1919 observation that Kautilya's work represented "truly radical Machiavellianism" had already begun circulating in international scholarly circles, creating intellectual excitement about the text's relevance to modern political theory. For Hindi-reading educated Indians, access to this foundational text in their own language carried both scholarly and nationalist significance.

## The Translators: Vidya Bhashker and Udayabeer Shastri

Vidya Bhashker and Professor Udayabeer Shastri, the collaborative translators of this edition, remain somewhat obscure figures in the historiography of Hindi literature and Indological scholarship, though their work on the Arthashastra represents a significant contribution to early 20th-century vernacular scholarship. The designation "Professor" for Udayabeer Shastri suggests an academic affiliation, likely with one of the emerging Hindi-medium institutions of higher education that proliferated in northern India during the 1910s-1920s. The title "Shastri" traditionally denoted advanced Sanskrit learning, indicating that Udayabeer possessed the classical training necessary to engage with the complex Sanskrit original.

Vidya Bhashker's collaboration suggests a partnership combining different expertise areas, possibly pairing Udayabeer Shastri's Sanskrit philological skills with Bhashker's command of literary Hindi prose suitable for modern educational purposes. Translating the Arthashastra posed formidable challenges beyond mere linguistic rendering: the text's technical vocabulary encompassed administration, economics, military strategy, diplomacy, espionage, and jurisprudence, each domain requiring specialized knowledge. Sanskrit political and administrative terms often lacked exact Hindi equivalents, necessitating either neologism creation or careful explanation of concepts using accessible language.

The translators worked in an era when Hindi prose itself was still evolving and standardizing its conventions. The late 19th and early 20th centuries witnessed intensive debates about Hindi's vocabulary base, with some scholars advocating heavily Sanskritized Hindi (called "Shuddh Hindi") while others preferred incorporating Urdu and Persian-derived terms that were already prevalent in common usage. The Arthashastra translation would have required careful navigation of these linguistic politics, particularly for political and administrative terminology that often derived from Persian-Urdu administrative vocabulary under Mughal influence but existed in classical Sanskrit forms in the original text.

The collaborative nature of this translation reflects a common pattern in early Hindi scholarship, where partnerships between pandits (traditional Sanskrit scholars) and modern educators produced works bridging classical learning and contemporary needs. Such collaborations ensured both fidelity to Sanskrit sources and accessibility to modern readers educated in Hindi-medium institutions. The fact that their translation has survived in digital archives suggests it achieved sufficient circulation and recognition to be preserved as part of India's documentary heritage.

## Significance for Hindi-Reading Audiences

For Hindi-speaking audiences in 1925 and subsequent decades, this translation opened crucial intellectual territory that had been largely inaccessible except to Sanskrit scholars and those reading English translations. The Hindi-reading public of the 1920s comprised diverse constituencies: students in Hindi-medium schools and colleges, nationalist activists seeking indigenous political models, traditional pandits adapting to modern formats, and the expanding literate middle class in Hindi-speaking regions of northern and central India. Each group found different value in accessing the Arthashastra.

Educational institutions increasingly adopted Hindi as a medium of instruction, creating demand for textbooks and scholarly works in Hindi across disciplines. The Arthashastra's comprehensive treatment of artha (political economy)—one of the four goals of human life (purusharthas) alongside dharma (righteousness), kama (pleasure), and moksha (liberation)—made it essential reading for understanding classical Indian civilization's approach to governance and material prosperity. Students of history, political science, and Sanskrit literature could now engage the text without English mediation, enabling more direct interpretation and application to contemporary concerns.

Political activists and thinkers in the independence movement found the Arthashastra particularly relevant as they grappled with questions of statecraft, governance models, and political strategy. While Gandhi's philosophy emphasized moral principles and non-violence, other nationalist leaders engaged more pragmatic approaches to power and state-building. Kautilya's realist political theory, with its emphasis on state security, strategic planning, and practical governance, offered an indigenous alternative to European political philosophies. The text demonstrated that sophisticated political thinking existed in ancient India, countering colonial claims that India lacked indigenous traditions of rational political analysis and required British tutelage in governance.

The availability of the Arthashastra in Hindi also contributed to scholarly debates about the relationship between traditional Indian political thought and emerging nationalist ideologies. The text's emphasis on strong centralized administration, economic development, and strategic statecraft resonated with leaders contemplating independent India's future governance structures. At the same time, its ruthlessly pragmatic approach to power, espionage, and warfare presented interpretive challenges for those seeking to construct narratives of Indian civilization as inherently spiritual and non-violent.

For general Hindi readers, the translation provided access to a foundational classic of world political literature in their own language, contributing to cultural pride and historical awareness. The Arthashastra's systematic treatment of administration, law, economics, diplomacy, and military affairs revealed the sophistication of ancient Indian civilization's practical achievements, not merely its religious and philosophical contributions. This broader understanding countered reductive colonial-era characterizations of Indian culture as otherworldly and impractical.

## Comparison with Sanskrit and English Editions

The Bhashker-Shastri Hindi translation occupied a distinct position within the emerging textual ecosystem surrounding the Arthashastra in the early 20th century. By 1925, several versions of the text were available: the Sanskrit original as published by Shamasastry (1909), Shamasastry's English translation (1915), and potentially other Sanskrit editions being prepared by various scholars. Each version served different audiences and purposes, creating a multilayered reception of the ancient text.

Compared to the Sanskrit original, the Hindi translation made the text accessible to readers with Hindi literacy but limited Sanskrit competence. While educated Indians of this era typically had some Sanskrit exposure through traditional education or school curricula, few possessed the advanced Sanskrit skills required to read the Arthashastra's complex philosophical prose, dense compound constructions, and specialized technical vocabulary. The Hindi rendering transformed an elite scholarly text into material accessible to the expanding Hindi-literate middle class, dramatically broadening the potential readership.

The relationship to English translations (particularly Shamasastry's 1915 edition) was more complex. English had become the language of higher education and administrative communication under colonial rule, and many educated Indians commanded English more fluently than classical Sanskrit. However, English remained a foreign language associated with colonial power, while Hindi represented Indian cultural identity and the vernacular language movement's aspirations. Reading the Arthashastra in Hindi rather than English constituted a subtle but significant assertion of indigenous intellectual ownership.

Linguistically, Hindi offered certain advantages and disadvantages compared to English for translating Sanskrit political texts. Hindi's Sanskrit-derived vocabulary and grammatical structures often allowed more direct rendering of concepts without the semantic shifts inherent in translating into a completely unrelated language like English. Terms like dharma, artha, and raja carried conceptual resonances in Hindi that English equivalents like "righteousness," "wealth," and "king" could not fully capture. Conversely, English had developed extensive political and administrative vocabulary through European political theory and British administrative practice, providing precise equivalents for many governance concepts that Hindi was still developing.

The challenge of technical terminology particularly distinguished the Hindi translation effort. The Arthashastra discusses administrative positions (adhyakshas), diplomatic strategies (shadgunya), theories of state structure (saptanga), and numerous other specialized concepts. English translators could draw on established political science vocabulary (superintendent, foreign policy, state elements), while Hindi translators faced choices between using Sanskrit terms directly (potentially obscure to less-educated readers), creating Hindi neologisms (potentially awkward or unclear), or borrowing from Persianate administrative vocabulary (potentially controversial among Hindu nationalists favoring "pure" Hindi).

The Bhashker-Shastri translation likely adopted varying strategies depending on context, balancing accessibility with fidelity to the original. Without access to the actual translation text, we can infer from contemporary Hindi scholarly practice that the translators probably retained key Sanskrit technical terms with explanatory glosses, adapted some terms into natural Hindi forms, and provided annotations or footnotes explaining particularly complex concepts. This approach would parallel contemporary Hindi translations of other Sanskrit classics, which navigated between scholarly rigor and popular accessibility.

Compared to later Hindi translations and editions that would appear throughout the 20th century with improved philological apparatus and modern critical scholarship, the 1925 Bhashker-Shastri edition represents an early pioneering effort working from Shamasastry's still-provisional understanding of the text. Subsequent discoveries of additional manuscripts and refinements in understanding the text's dating and composition would inform later translations, but the 1925 edition holds historical significance as among the first efforts to make this recovered classic available to Hindi readers.

## Role in Modern Indian Political Discourse

The availability of the Arthashastra in Hindi contributed to its integration into modern Indian political discourse in ways that English-only availability could not have achieved. While English translations reached international scholarly audiences and English-educated Indian elites, vernacular translations embedded the text within regional intellectual conversations and made it accessible to political activists, journalists, educators, and public intellectuals operating primarily in Indian languages.

During the 1920s-1940s independence movement, references to Kautilya and the Arthashastra appeared in Hindi political journalism, nationalist literature, and educational contexts as part of the broader project of recovering indigenous intellectual traditions. The text provided historical precedent for sophisticated Indian political thinking independent of European models, serving nationalist arguments that India possessed mature political traditions that British colonial rhetoric denied. Comparisons between Kautilya and Machiavelli became commonplace in political discourse, with the point being that India's political realism predated Europe's by centuries.

However, the Arthashastra's pragmatic, sometimes ruthless approach to statecraft created tensions with certain strains of nationalist ideology. Gandhi's emphasis on truth (satya), non-violence (ahimsa), and moral politics contrasted sharply with Kautilya's advocacy of espionage, strategic deception, and warfare as legitimate instruments of statecraft. This tension generated productive debates about whether independent India should draw on Kautilyan realpolitik or pursue alternative visions of ethical governance. Hindi-language discussions of these issues, facilitated by the availability of translations like the Bhashker-Shastri edition, enriched political discourse beyond elite English-speaking circles.

Post-independence, the Arthashastra remained relevant to debates about governance models, economic policy, and foreign relations. Nehru's vision of centralized planning and state-directed economic development found some resonance with Kautilyan emphasis on state intervention in the economy, though Nehru's socialist commitments diverged from Kautilya's support for private property and market mechanisms. Later leaders and theorists have selectively invoked the Arthashastra to support various policy positions, from strong centralized authority to strategic autonomy in foreign policy.

Contemporary Indian political discourse continues to reference the Arthashastra, particularly in discussions of statecraft, diplomacy, and national security. The text's Mandala theory of concentric circles of allied and enemy states has been applied to understanding South Asian geopolitics, with Pakistan as the immediate enemy (ari), more distant powers as potential allies (mitra), and complex calculations about relationships with China, the United States, and other actors. Hindi-language publications on political strategy, history, and current affairs regularly invoke Kautilyan concepts, building on the foundation established by early translations like the 1925 edition.

The Arthashastra also features in broader cultural nationalism, where it serves as evidence of ancient Indian civilization's achievements in practical domains beyond spirituality and philosophy. Hindi-language historical and cultural literature presents Kautilya alongside other major figures of Indian intellectual history, establishing continuity between ancient wisdom and modern national identity. Educational curricula in Hindi-medium institutions incorporate the text into courses on ancient Indian history, political thought, and classical literature.

Critically, some contemporary scholars and activists have questioned the selective invocation of Kautilyan authority, noting that the text reflects hierarchical social structures, monarchical government, and patriarchal assumptions at odds with democratic and egalitarian values. These critical perspectives have also found expression in Hindi-language academic and public discourse, creating more nuanced engagement with the classical text than uncritical celebration. The availability of the Arthashastra in Hindi has enabled these debates to occur within vernacular intellectual communities, not merely in English-medium academic contexts.

## The 1925 Edition's Enduring Legacy

The Bhashker-Shastri 1925 Hindi translation occupies an important position in the transmission history of the Arthashastra as it moved from lost manuscript to global classic. Coming at the crucial early period following the text's rediscovery, this translation helped establish the Arthashastra as a canonical text of Indian political thought for Hindi-speaking audiences. While subsequent translations with improved philological foundations and modern critical apparatus have superseded it for scholarly purposes, the 1925 edition's historical significance remains considerable.

The translation exemplifies the vernacularization movement of early 20th-century Indian intellectual life, when scholars deliberately created Hindi-language versions of classical texts to build modern Hindi's capacity as a complete language of learning. This effort paralleled similar movements in other Indian languages (Bengali, Marathi, Tamil, etc.), each seeking to transform regional vernaculars into vehicles for modern knowledge while maintaining connections to classical traditions. The result was the democratization of access to India's intellectual heritage beyond Sanskrit-reading elites and English-educated classes.

Digitization efforts by the Digital Library of India and other initiatives have given the 1925 translation new life in the 21st century. Uploaded to Internet Archive and other digital repositories, the text remains accessible to contemporary readers interested in historical translations or seeking Hindi-language access to the Arthashastra. While modern readers might prefer contemporary translations incorporating recent scholarship, the 1925 edition offers a window into how early 20th-century scholars approached the text and how it was presented to Hindi audiences of that era.

The work also represents the scholarly labor of translators like Vidya Bhashker and Professor Udayabeer Shastri, whose contributions to Hindi intellectual life deserve recognition. These scholars worked in an era when translation was not merely technical linguistic work but a form of cultural nationalism and educational service. Their efforts to make the Arthashastra available in Hindi contributed to the broader project of demonstrating Indian civilization's intellectual achievements and providing educational resources in Indian languages. While their names may not be as well-known as major political leaders or literary figures of the period, their translation work formed essential infrastructure for vernacular intellectual culture.

The continuing relevance of the Arthashastra in contemporary Indian political and strategic thinking ensures that the tradition established by translations like the 1925 edition remains vital. Whether invoked to justify realpolitik in foreign policy, explain ancient administrative systems in historical studies, or provide indigenous precedents for governance theories, Kautilya's treatise maintains a presence in Indian public discourse. Hindi-language engagement with the text, enabled by the pioneering work of early translators, ensures that these discussions remain accessible beyond English-speaking elites, embedding the Arthashastra in broader Indian intellectual and political culture.
