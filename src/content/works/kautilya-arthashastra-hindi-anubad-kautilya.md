# Kautilya Arthashastra Hindi Anubad

## Overview

This 1925 Hindi translation (anubad) of the Arthashastra represents an early scholarly effort to make Kautilya's classical political treatise accessible to modern Hindi readers. Published two decades after the text's 1905 rediscovery, this edition by Vidya Bhashker and Professor Udayabeer Shastri emerged during heightened Indian interest in indigenous political philosophy and governance systems. The Arthashastra, composed in multiple layers between 150 BCE and 300 CE, comprises 15 books, 150 chapters, and approximately 5,300 sentences addressing every aspect of ancient Indian statecraft—from economic policy and military strategy to law, diplomacy, and administrative organization.

## About Kautilya and the Text

Kautilya (also known as Kauṭalya or Vishnugupta) is the attributed author of the Arthashastra, though modern scholarship reveals the text resulted from multiple authors working across several centuries rather than a single individual. Medieval Indian tradition identified Kautilya with Chanakya, the legendary minister to Emperor Chandragupta Maurya (c. 321–297 BCE), but scholars now recognize this association as a later Gupta-era interpolation. The Arthashastra served as India's preeminent manual of statecraft from its composition through the 12th century CE, after which it disappeared from active use until its dramatic rediscovery in 1905. The text's sophisticated political analysis demonstrates that ancient India possessed highly developed theories of governance that rivaled contemporary political philosophy in other civilizations.

## Historical Context

This 1925 translation emerged during British colonial rule, when Indian intellectuals intensified their search for indigenous political and philosophical traditions that could inform the independence movement and future self-governance. The Arthashastra's rediscovery in 1905 had revealed a sophisticated tradition of Indian political thought previously unknown to both Western scholars and many Indians educated in colonial systems. By producing Hindi translations in the 1920s, scholars like Vidya Bhashker and Udayabeer Shastri made this knowledge accessible beyond Sanskrit pandits and English-educated elites, contributing to broader cultural reclamation efforts. The timing coincided with growing nationalist sentiment and debates about what forms of governance might replace colonial administration, making classical political texts newly relevant to contemporary Indian concerns.

## Content and Significance

The Arthashastra systematically addresses governance across 15 comprehensive books. The largest section (Book 2, containing 1,285 sentences) covers administrative structures and economic management. Key topics include:

- **Political Organization**: Royal duties, ministerial appointments, administrative hierarchies, and council operations
- **Economic Policy**: Taxation systems, agriculture, mining, manufacturing, trade regulation, and currency management
- **Military Science**: Army composition, fortification techniques, siege warfare, and battlefield strategy
- **Foreign Relations**: Diplomatic protocols, alliance formation, espionage networks, and treaty negotiation
- **Legal Systems**: Civil law, criminal justice, evidence standards, and punishment gradations
- **Public Administration**: Infrastructure development, disaster relief, public health, and citizen welfare

The text's pragmatic approach to power and governance has made it a subject of continuing study in political science, international relations, and organizational management. This 1925 Hindi translation played a crucial role in disseminating classical Indian political thought during the crucial decades leading to independence, when Indians sought indigenous intellectual resources for envisioning future governance structures.

## This Edition

Vidya Bhashker and Professor Udayabeer Shastri's 1925 Hindi translation represents an important early effort to render classical Sanskrit political literature in modern Indian languages. As one of the earliest Hindi editions following the text's 1905 rediscovery, this work helped establish terminology and interpretive frameworks for discussing ancient Indian political thought in Hindi. The translation's publication during the colonial period made the Arthashastra accessible to a broader Indian audience engaged in debates about governance, economics, and political organization. The Internet Archive's digitization preserves this historically significant edition, documenting both the classical text itself and early 20th-century approaches to translating and interpreting ancient Indian political philosophy.
