# The Sikh Religion: Its Gurus, Sacred Writings and Authors

## Overview

Published in 1909 by Oxford's Clarendon Press, this six-volume masterwork represents the first comprehensive English study of Sikhism—its history, scriptures, gurus, and spiritual tradition. Max Arthur Macauliffe, an Irish-born British administrator who converted to Sikhism, spent over twenty years collaborating with Sikh scholars to produce translations of the Guru Granth Sahib, biographies of the ten Gurus (Guru Nanak through Guru Gobind Singh), and writings of Bhagats (Sikh saints).

The work introduced Sikhism to the English-speaking world at a scholarly level, countering British dismissal of Sikh religion as merely a Hindu-Islamic syncretism. Macauliffe demonstrated Sikhism's distinct theology, sophisticated scripture, and rich spiritual tradition—work that earned deep gratitude from the Sikh community while alienating his British colleagues who derided him for "turning Sikh."

## About Max Arthur Macauliffe (1838-1913)

Born Michael McAuliffe in County Limerick, Ireland, he graduated with first-class honors in Modern Languages from Queen's College Galway (1860) before joining the Indian Civil Service in 1862. Arriving in Punjab in 1864, he rose to Deputy Commissioner (1882) and Divisional Judge (1884), retiring in 1893 after three decades in India.

During his service, Macauliffe encountered Sikhism and underwent spiritual conversion—rare among British administrators. He learned Punjabi and Gurmukhi script, studied Sikh scripture, befriended Sikh scholars, and adopted Sikh practices. British officials mocked his conversion, but Macauliffe remained committed, seeing in Sikhism a profound monotheistic faith emphasizing social equality and devotional practice.

After retirement, he devoted himself entirely to his magnum opus, collaborating closely with Sikh scholars including the renowned Kahn Singh Nabha. The six volumes represent not solo Western scholarship but genuine partnership between convert scholar and indigenous tradition-bearers—unusual for colonial-era Orientalism.

When Macauliffe died in London on March 15, 1913, witnesses heard him reciting Japji Sahib, the Sikh morning prayer composed by Guru Nanak. His ashes were brought to India and scattered in Sikh sacred sites—honor reserved for deeply respected community members.

## Structure and Contents

**Volume I**: Life and teachings of Guru Nanak (1469-1539), Sikhism's founder. Includes translations of Guru Nanak's hymns from the Guru Granth Sahib, historical context of late medieval Punjab, and the Guru's revolutionary message of one God, equality, honest living, and devotion.

**Volume II**: Guru Angad, Guru Amar Das, and Guru Ram Das—the second, third, and fourth Gurus who consolidated the community, established social institutions (langar communal kitchen), and created Sikh identity markers.

**Volume III**: Guru Arjan (compiler of the first Adi Granth/Guru Granth Sahib) and Guru Hargobind who militarized the community in response to Mughal persecution. Chronicles martyrdom of Guru Arjan and transition from purely spiritual to miri-piri (temporal-spiritual) leadership.

**Volume IV**: Guru Har Rai and Guru Har Krishan, the seventh and eighth Gurus. Coverage of Sikh-Mughal relations and community development during this period.

**Volume V**: Guru Tegh Bahadur (martyred for defending religious freedom) and the early life and writings of Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Guru who created the Khalsa, the baptized Sikh community.

**Volume VI**: Conclusion of Guru Gobind Singh's life, the finalization of Guru Granth Sahib as perpetual living Guru after him, and writings of Bhagats (saints from various backgrounds whose hymns are included in Guru Granth Sahib—showing Sikhism's inclusive approach to spiritual wisdom).

Each volume combines historical biography, philosophical explanation, and translated sacred writings—making Sikh thought accessible while respecting its depth.

## Collaborative Scholarship

Macauliffe worked extensively with Sikh scholars, particularly Bhai Kahn Singh Nabha, encyclopedist and theologian. This collaboration ensured translations respected Sikh interpretive traditions while remaining intelligible to English readers. Macauliffe acknowledged his debt to Sikh scholars throughout, recognizing he served as translator and compiler rather than sole authority.

This collaborative approach distinguished Macauliffe's work from much Victorian Orientalism, which often imposed Western interpretations on Eastern texts. While his presentation still reflected British scholarly conventions, the substance came from Sikh tradition-bearers who guided translation and interpretation.

## Reception and Legacy

The Sikh community received the work with enormous appreciation. For the first time, their scripture and history were presented to the Western world through serious scholarship rather than dismissive colonial commentary. The Golden Temple honored Macauliffe, and Sikh scholars promoted the work widely.

Western scholars recognized the achievement even while some criticized Macauliffe's sympathetic stance. His conversion and advocacy made the work suspect to those expecting "objective" scholarly distance. Yet this insider-outsider position—British by birth, Sikh by choice—enabled understanding impossible for purely external observers.

The six volumes remained the standard English reference on Sikhism for decades. While subsequent scholarship has produced new translations and interpretations, Macauliffe's work retains value both for its comprehensive scope and its historical significance as the first major English study of Sikhism by someone deeply committed to the faith.

For Sikh diaspora communities in English-speaking countries, Macauliffe's volumes provided accessible entry into their tradition. Generations have learned Sikh history and scripture through his translations, making the work foundational to global Sikh identity.

## Critical Perspective

Modern scholars note limitations: Victorian prose style, occasional missionary-influenced language (despite Macauliffe's own rejection of Christianity), and presentation shaped by British academic conventions. More recent translations of Guru Granth Sahib by Sikh scholars offer alternatives.

Yet Macauliffe's achievement—sustained collaboration, linguistic competence, spiritual commitment, and comprehensive scope—remains remarkable. His work demonstrated that respectful cross-cultural scholarship required more than academic training; it demanded genuine engagement, willingness to learn from tradition-bearers, and readiness to question one's own cultural assumptions.

## This Digital Edition

This Internet Archive preservation ensures continued free access to Macauliffe's monumental work. For students of Sikhism, comparative religion, or colonial-era scholarship, the volumes offer both substantial content about Sikh tradition and insight into how an Irish convert introduced that tradition to the English-speaking world through partnership with Sikh scholars.
