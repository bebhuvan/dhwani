description: "William Bolts's two-volume French exposé État civil, politique et commerçant du Bengale (1778) provides a scathing critique of British East India Company rule in Bengal. An ex-Company merchant expelled for private trading, Bolts documents the Company's conquest of Bengal, systematic fiscal exploitation, commercial monopolies, and administrative corruption during the 1760s. Volume 1 recounts the Company's military expansion, oppressive revenue collection, and monopolistic trade practices that devastated Bengali weavers and merchants. Volume 2 continues the indictment, examining revenue settlements under the Dewani (1765), private trade abuses by Company officials, diplomatic scandals, and the famine of 1769-70 which Bolts attributes to Company misrule. Originally published in English as Considerations on India Affairs (1772), this French translation aimed to influence Continental European opinion against British commercial imperialism. Bolts's eyewitness account, though partisan, provides invaluable documentation of early Company rule's economic impact on Bengal, predating later critiques by Edmund Burke and parliamentary investigations. The work influenced European Enlightenment debates about colonial exploitation and remains a primary source for understanding 18th-century Bengal's transformation under Company administration."

# État civil, politique et commerçant du Bengale

## Overview

William Bolts's État civil, politique et commerçant du Bengale (Civil, Political and Commercial State of Bengal) stands as one of the earliest and most devastating critiques of British East India Company rule in India. Published in two volumes in Geneva (1778), this French translation of his earlier English work Considerations on India Affairs (1772-1775) brought the realities of Company exploitation to Continental European audiences during the Enlightenment era.

## About William Bolts

William Bolts (1739-1808) was a Dutch-born merchant who served in the British East India Company in Bengal from 1759 to 1768. An ambitious trader, he engaged in private commerce that conflicted with Company monopolies, leading to his expulsion from Bengal in 1768. His personal grievances, combined with genuine concern about Company misrule, motivated his exposé. After leaving India, Bolts unsuccessfully attempted to establish rival trading companies backed by Austrian and French interests, making him both critic and competitor of British commercial imperialism.

## Content and Structure

**Volume 1** chronicles the East India Company's transformation from trading corporation to territorial power following the Battle of Plassey (1757). Bolts documents:
- The Company's military conquests and manipulation of Bengali rulers
- Oppressive revenue collection methods destroying agricultural productivity
- Commercial monopolies forcing weavers to sell below cost
- Corruption among Company officials enriching themselves through private trade
- The displacement of traditional Bengali merchant classes

**Volume 2** continues the indictment, examining:
- The Dewani (revenue administration) granted by Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II (1765)
- Systematic extraction of wealth disguised as "legitimate" taxation
- The catastrophic Bengal Famine of 1769-70, killing an estimated 10 million people
- Bolts's argument that Company's revenue demands and trade disruptions caused the famine
- Diplomatic scandals and the Company's manipulation of Indian political rivalries
- Proposals for reforming Company governance (which Parliament largely ignored)

## Historical Significance

Bolts's critique predated the better-known denunciations by Edmund Burke and the parliamentary investigations of Warren Hastings in the 1780s. His eyewitness testimony provided empirical evidence of Company exploitation that influenced European Enlightenment thinkers concerned with commercial ethics and colonial governance. Though Bolts had personal axes to grind (his expulsion and business rivalry), his documentation of Company abuses proved largely accurate, corroborated by later investigations.

The work contributed to growing European awareness that commercial companies wielding sovereign powers posed moral and political dangers. It anticipated debates about corporate responsibility, colonial exploitation, and the relationship between commerce and ethics that would intensify in the 19th century.

## Digital Preservation

Both volumes have been digitized and made freely available through the Internet Archive, preserving this important primary source for scholars of colonial India, economic history, and Enlightenment political thought.
