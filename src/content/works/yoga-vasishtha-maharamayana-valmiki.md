  The Yoga-Vasishtha Maharamayana is a Sanskrit philosophical text of approximately 29,000 verses presenting an extended dialogue between the sage Vasistha and Prince Rama on the nature of reality, consciousness, and liberation. While traditionally attributed to Valmiki, scholarly consensus dates its composition to between the 11th and 14th centuries CE, identifying it as an expansion of the earlier Mokṣopāya text composed in Kashmir around the 10th century. The work absorbed influences from Saivite Trika philosophy while establishing itself as an authoritative scripture within Advaita Vedanta orthodoxy.

  The text's narrative frame presents Rama returning from pilgrimage throughout India, experiencing profound disillusionment (vairagya) with the transient nature of worldly existence. Vasistha, royal preceptor to the Ikshvaku dynasty and one of the seven great rishis, recognizes this crisis as opportunity for philosophical instruction. The dialogical structure grounds abstract metaphysical teachings in concrete existential questions while modeling the traditional guru-disciple relationship.

  The philosophical framework articulates a sophisticated non-dualistic position: ultimate reality consists solely of Brahman—infinite, unchanging, self-luminous consciousness—while the perceived multiplicity of phenomena represents maya (illusion) arising from avidya (ignorance). The text employs the recurring metaphor that the universe exists "like a city in the clouds" or "like a dream," possessing apparent reality within ignorance but recognized as ultimately unreal upon awakening to knowledge. Central to its distinctive contribution is the doctrine of sankalpa, the creative power of consciousness to generate experiential reality through conceptualization. This emphasis on consciousness's innate creative capacity yields practical implications: since bondage consists primarily of mental conditioning (vasanas) generating the experience of limitation, liberation becomes achievable through transforming consciousness itself rather than manipulating external circumstances.

  The complete text comprises six prakaranas (books): Vairagya Prakarana (Dispassion), establishing Rama's spiritual readiness; Mumukshu Vyavahara Prakarana (Behavior of the Seeker), describing qualifications for spiritual practice; Utpatti Prakarana (Creation), examining how consciousness generates phenomenal reality; Sthiti Prakarana (Existence), exploring the apparent persistence of the manifested world; Upasama Prakarana (Dissolution), discussing dissolution of ignorance and achievement of liberation; and Nirvana Prakarana (Liberation), presenting the highest teachings on final realization. The literary structure employs nested frame narratives, with Vasistha's teachings containing numerous embedded stories—some extending through multiple levels of narrative recursion—that dramatize philosophical principles through mythological narratives and allegorical tales.

  The text distinguishes itself through its integration of rigorous metaphysical analysis with practical yogic methodology, its emphasis on self-effort (puruṣārtha) over ritualistic observance or divine grace, and its detailed exploration of the practice of vicara (philosophical inquiry) as primary means to liberation. Its sophisticated analysis of consciousness, mental processes, and the mechanics of bondage influenced both philosophical Vedanta and contemplative yoga traditions. By the 14th century it had received extensive commentaries from Advaita scholars and inspired the condensed Laghu-Yoga-Vasistha of approximately 6,000 verses.

  Vihari Lala Mitra (1833-1896), a Bengali scholar and translator, undertook the monumental task of rendering the complete text into English during the late 19th century. His translation, published by Bonnerjee and Co. in Calcutta between 1891 and 1899, appeared in four volumes comprising seven parts, providing English-speaking audiences their first comprehensive access to this philosophical text. Modern reception was furthered by prominent spiritual teachers including Swami Vivekananda and Ramana Maharshi, who frequently cited the text in their teachings.
