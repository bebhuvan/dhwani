# Krtyaratnakara (The Jewel Mine of Ritual Duties)

## Overview

The Krtyaratnakara is a comprehensive medieval Sanskrit legal and ritual digest (nibandha) composed by Candesvara Thakkura in the 14th century. This 1925 edition, edited by Kamal Krsna Smrtitirtha, represents an important scholarly publication of a major Dharmashastra text that systematically compiled rules for religious duties and civil law.

## Historical Context

Candesvara Thakkura (14th century) was a Maithili political theorist, general, and scholar who served as minister for peace and war and chief judge in the court of Harisimhadeva, the last king of the Karnat dynasty of Mithila (present-day Bihar-Nepal border region). Born into a family of Maithil Brahmins who were learned scholars in the Karnat court, Candesvara created this monumental work during a period when medieval legal digests (nibandhas) were systematizing earlier Smriti literature.

## Content

**Scope**: Comprehensive coverage of Dharmashastra including daily religious obligations (nityakarma), occasional rites (naimittika karma), penances (prayashchitta), and civil matters including inheritance, adoption, and property law.

**Methodology**: Candesvara compiled material from numerous earlier Smritis (including Manu, Yajnavalkya, and others) along with their commentaries, creating a systematic digest organized by topic rather than following a single source text.

**Special Features**: Contains a lengthy manual on goddess ritual spread over the entire month of Āśvina, demonstrating the integration of Shakta worship into Brahmanical legal tradition.

## Significance

The Krtyaratnakara represents the mature development of medieval Hindu legal thought in the Bengal-Bihar cultural sphere. As a nibandha (digest), it exemplifies how medieval scholars systematized earlier legal literature to address contemporary religious and social questions. The text remains valuable for understanding how Dharmashastra was interpreted and applied in medieval Mithila, and for tracing the evolution of Hindu law from ancient Dharmasutra texts through medieval practice.

Frequently cited in P.V. Kane's monumental "History of Dharmasastra" and other scholarly studies of Hindu law.
