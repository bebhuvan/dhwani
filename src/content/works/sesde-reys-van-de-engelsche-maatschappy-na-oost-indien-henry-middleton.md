description: |
  Pieter van der Aa's 1707 Dutch translation of the sixth voyage narrative of the English East India Company represents a critical cartographic and documentary record of early 17th-century maritime exploration in the Indian Ocean region, offering nuanced insights into European colonial interactions with Indian maritime networks. The text, derived from Sir Henry Middleton's expedition logs and Nicholas Downton's maritime records, provides a comprehensive account of English commercial and navigational strategies in the Red Sea and Arabian Sea theaters between 1605-1607. This work illuminates the complex geopolitical dynamics of the emerging global trading systems, particularly the intricate commercial negotiations surrounding the lucrative Mocha coffee trade, which was pivotal in connecting Arabian, Indian, and European mercantile networks. Middleton's expedition, documented in meticulous maritime detail, captures the technological and navigational challenges of transoceanic voyages during the early stages of European maritime expansion. The text offers substantial ethnographic observations about coastal trading communities, maritime infrastructure, and intercultural commercial practices in regions including Gujarat, the Malabar Coast, and the Arabian Peninsula. Van der Aa's Dutch translation further demonstrates the transnational circulation of maritime knowledge, highlighting how European maritime powers rapidly shared and translated navigational intelligence. Beyond its immediate commercial context, the narrative provides valuable historical documentation of early 17th-century maritime technologies, diplomatic protocols, and cross-cultural interactions, serving as a critical primary source for understanding the intricate mechanisms of emergent global trade networks and European colonial penetration of Indian Ocean maritime spaces.

# Sesde reys van de Engelsche Maatschappy na Oost-Indien

## Why this matters

Leiden publisher Pieter van der Aa built a market by translating foreign travelogues for Dutch readers. His 1707 edition of the Company’s sixth voyage renders Sir Henry Middleton’s 1610–1613 expedition and Nicholas Downton’s day-register into Dutch, transmitting English commercial intelligence about the Red Sea coffee trade to the VOC’s home audience.

## What's inside

Middleton’s journal recounts the fleet’s watering at Socotra, the fraught negotiations at Mocha that ended with Ottoman officials imprisoning English factors, and his retaliation—detaining Red Sea shipping until reparations were paid. Van der Aa preserves Middleton’s hydrographic notes, cargo inventories, and letters to Surat merchants. Downton’s “Dag-register” then records daily routines aboard the *Peppercorn*: provisioning at Saldanha Bay, skirmishes near the Hadhramaut coast, and the tactics used to fend off Portuguese patrols while escorting vessels bound for Bantam.

## Historical setting

The sixth voyage marks the Company’s earliest sustained bid to buy coffee directly in Yemen and secure a permanent factory at Surat. Middleton’s clash with Ottoman authorities shaped later Company instructions about factory security and diplomacy. Downton would soon command the 1614 fleet that fought the Portuguese off Swally, making this diary a precursor to Anglo-Portuguese naval rivalry narratives. Dutch translation of the text shows how closely the VOC monitored English moves.

## Research notes

Comparing van der Aa’s edition with English printings (Purchas’s *Pilgrimes* or the Hakluyt Society) reveals abridgements and emphases tailored to Dutch readers. The engravings inserted by van der Aa supply coastal profiles absent from English editions, and the index (“Kort inhoud”) aligns with Dutch mapping conventions. Because the translation compresses some passages, researchers can map divergences to track how intelligence circulated between rival companies.

## Access

The Internet Archive scan includes high-resolution images of the engraved title and fold-out plates. OCR supports keyword searches for ports such as “Mocha” or “Suratte,” while the PDF download allows close inspection of the cartouches and marginal notes.
