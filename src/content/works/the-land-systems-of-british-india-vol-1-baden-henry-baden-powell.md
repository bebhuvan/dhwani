# The Land Systems of British India (Vol. 1)

## Overview
A senior settlement officer and jurist, Baden-Powell distilled decades of administrative experience into this multi-volume reference. Volume 1 explains the legal concepts behind British Indian land tenures, outlines survey and settlement procedures, and analyses how Bengal’s Permanent Settlement shaped agrarian relations.

## Highlights
Chapters detail the distinction between zamindari, mahalwari, and raiyatwari frameworks, compare provincial variations, and summarise the statutory orders underpinning each system. Baden-Powell also discusses revenue farming, village commons, and the evolution of tenant-right under changing legislation.

## Access Notes
The Internet Archive scan provides crisp images of tables and appendices, with OCR that supports citation searches across the extensive comparative notes and bibliographies.
