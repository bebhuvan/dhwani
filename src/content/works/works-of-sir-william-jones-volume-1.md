# The Works of Sir William Jones, Volume I

## Overview

*The Works of Sir William Jones, Volume I* (1799) is the first volume of the posthumous collected edition of writings by Sir William Jones (1746-1794), founder of the Asiatic Society of Bengal and pioneer of comparative linguistics. Edited by his widow Anna Maria Jones (née Shipley) and published by G.G. and J. Robinson and R.H. Evans in London, this 558-page quarto volume contains Jones's eleven Anniversary Discourses delivered to the Asiatic Society between 1784 and 1794.

## About Sir William Jones

Sir William Jones (1746-1794) was a British philologist, jurist, and polyglot who mastered 28 languages. Appointed as a judge to the Supreme Court of Bengal in 1783, he founded the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1784 to promote "inquiry into the History, Civil and Natural, the Antiquities, Arts, Sciences and Literature of Asia."

Jones's most lasting contribution was his observation, presented in his Third Anniversary Discourse (1786), of the "wonderful structure" of Sanskrit and its kinship with Greek and Latin. This insight launched the field of historical linguistics and Indo-European studies, fundamentally changing how scholars understood language relationships and human history.

## The Foundational Third Discourse (1786)

Jones's most famous passage, from his Third Anniversary Discourse "On the Hindus" delivered February 2, 1786:

> "The Sanskrit language, whatever be its antiquity, is of a wonderful structure; more perfect than the Greek, more copious than the Latin, and more exquisitely refined than either, yet bearing to both of them a stronger affinity, both in the roots of verbs and in the forms of grammar, than could possibly have been produced by accident; so strong indeed, that no philologer could examine them all three, without believing them to have sprung from some common source, which, perhaps, no longer exists."

This observation established the foundation for comparative philology and the discovery of the Indo-European language family.

## Contents of Volume I: The Eleven Anniversary Discourses

1. **Discourse I (1784)**: On the Institution of a Society - establishing the mission and scope of the Asiatic Society
2. **Discourse II (1785)**: On the History and Arts of Asia - surveying the field of Asian studies
3. **Discourse III (1786)**: On the Hindus - the foundational text of comparative linguistics
4. **Discourse IV (1787)**: On the Arabs - examining Arabian civilization and literature
5. **Discourse V (1788)**: On the Tartars - investigating Turkic and Central Asian peoples
6. **Discourse VI (1789)**: On the Persians - analyzing Persian history, culture, and literature
7. **Discourse VII (1790)**: On the Chinese - exploring Chinese civilization and philosophy
8. **Discourse VIII (1791)**: On the Borderers, Mountaineers, and Islanders of Asia - peripheral Asian societies
9. **Discourse IX (1792)**: On the Origin and Families of Nations - comparative ethnology and migration
10. **Discourse X (1793)**: On Asiatick History, Civil and Natural - methodology for historical research
11. **Discourse XI (1794)**: On the Philosophy of the Asiaticks - Asian philosophical systems

These discourses demonstrate Jones's encyclopedic approach to Asian civilizations, covering history, arts, sciences, philosophy, and literature across the continent.

## Historical Context

Jones delivered these discourses as president of the Asiatic Society during the formative years of British colonial administration in India. Working in Calcutta from 1783 until his death in 1794, he combined his judicial duties with intensive scholarly research, learning Sanskrit, Persian, and Arabic while producing translations, grammars, and comparative studies.

The Asiatic Society became the model for subsequent Oriental societies worldwide and institutionalized the study of Asian civilizations within European academia. Jones's work, while pioneering in its linguistic insights, also reflected and reinforced British colonial ideologies about Asian civilizations.

## Publication History

After Jones's sudden death from inflammation of the liver on April 27, 1794, his widow Anna Maria Jones edited his collected works. The first edition appeared in six volumes (1799), with two supplemental volumes added in 1801. A comprehensive 13-volume edition including Lord Teignmouth's biography was published in 1807.

Volume I includes a frontispiece portrait, three folding plates, and twenty-six additional plates illustrating Asian subjects, monuments, and inscriptions.

## Scholarly Significance

Jones's *Works* represent a watershed moment in European engagement with Asian civilizations. His linguistic discoveries:

- Established comparative linguistics as a scientific discipline
- Demonstrated the Indo-European language family's existence
- Changed European understanding of historical connections between civilizations
- Influenced Romantic-era enthusiasm for Oriental cultures

However, postcolonial scholarship has critically examined Jones's role in colonial knowledge production, noting how Orientalist scholarship served British administrative and ideological interests while simultaneously advancing linguistic science.

## Legacy

The Asiatic Society of Bengal (now Asiatic Society) continues to operate in Kolkata. Jones's comparative linguistic method influenced generations of scholars including Franz Bopp, Jacob Grimm, and Max Müller. His work on Hindu and Muslim law influenced British legal administration in India for over a century.

Modern Indo-European linguistics, while far more sophisticated, still traces its origins to Jones's 1786 observation about Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin.
