description: "The Tolkappiyam represents Tamil literature's oldest extant work and most authoritative grammar-poetics treatise, systematizing Tamil language, prosody, and literary aesthetics through approximately 1,610 sutras organized into three books addressing orthography-phonology, morphology-syntax, and poetics-rhetoric. Composed likely between 5th century BCE and 2nd century CE, this foundational text establishes Tamil's grammatical structure independent from Sanskrit while demonstrating sophisticated linguistic analysis: phoneme classification, sandhi rules, morphological processes, syntactic principles, and semantic relationships. Beyond linguistic description, Tolkappiyam presents comprehensive literary theory: classifying landscapes (tinai) with associated emotions, seasons, occupations, and deities; systematizing poetic conventions (akam-interior/love poetry vs. puram-exterior/war-heroic poetry); and articulating aesthetic principles governing classical Tamil poetry. The work influenced Tamil literary tradition profoundly, with all subsequent Sangam literature following its prescriptive conventions, while demonstrating Tamil civilization's independent intellectual development and sophisticated aesthetic philosophy."
