# South Indian Images of Gods and Goddesses

## Overview

Published in 1916 by the Madras Government Museum, this study represents early systematic documentation of South Indian Hindu iconography by H. Krishna Sastri, one of the Archaeological Survey of India's most accomplished epigraphists and archaeologists. The work catalogs and analyzes sculptural representations of major Hindu deities—Shiva, Vishnu, Devi, Ganesha, Murugan, and others—across South Indian temples and museum collections, explaining iconographic conventions governing their visual depiction.

Krishna Sastri's approach combined archaeological observation with traditional textual scholarship. He correlated sculptural forms with prescriptions in Agamas (temple ritual texts) and Shilpa Shastras (artistic treatises), showing how South Indian sculptors followed precise iconographic rules while developing distinctive regional styles. The work documents gesture symbolism (mudras), divine attributes, vehicle associations (vahanas), and the theological meanings encoded in sculptural form.

## About H. Krishna Sastri (1870-1928)

Hirananda Krishna Sastri joined the Archaeological Survey of India in 1903, working under John Marshall during the Survey's reconstruction and expansion. A Sanskrit scholar as well as archaeologist, Krishna Sastri made pioneering contributions to South Indian epigraphy, particularly Brahmi inscriptions and early Tamil-Brahmi script.

His archaeological work at Nagarjunakonda (Buddhist site in Andhra Pradesh) and numerous South Indian temple sites combined field archaeology with epigraphic and art historical analysis. As Superintendent of the Southern Circle (1910s-1920s), he oversaw major excavations and conservation projects, documenting monuments that would later be recognized as masterpieces of Indian architecture.

Krishna Sastri represented the first generation of Indian archaeologists trained in European scientific methods yet deeply knowledgeable in Sanskrit, Tamil, and traditional Indian scholarship. This dual competence enabled interpretations inaccessible to purely Western-trained archaeologists or traditional pandits unfamiliar with archaeological methodology.

## Iconographic Analysis

The book systematically examines how South Indian sculpture represents divinity through visual codes:

**Shiva**: Multiple forms—Nataraja (cosmic dancer), Dakshinamurti (teacher), Ardhanarishvara (half-female), Bhikshatana (mendicant). Each form has specific attributes, postures, and hand gestures encoding theological concepts. The iconic Chola Nataraja bronzes exemplify this iconographic precision—right hand in abhaya mudra (fearlessness), left holding agni (fire), one foot crushing ignorance, the other in cosmic dance.

**Vishnu**: Representations as Narayana, Krishna, Rama, and the Dashavatara (ten incarnations). Iconography specifies the four hands' objects (conch, discus, mace, lotus), the posture (standing, seated, reclining), and associated figures (Lakshmi, Garuda). Regional variations in Vaishnava sculpture reflect theological schools—Sri Vaishnava versus Tengalai traditions influencing depiction.

**Devi**: The goddess in her multiple aspects—Durga slaying Mahishasura, Lakshmi in padmasana, Saraswati with veena, Kali with severed heads. South Indian Shakta iconography shows regional preferences—Meenakshi in Madurai, Kamakshi in Kanchipuram—each with distinctive attributes.

**Regional Styles**: Krishna Sastri documents how Chola, Pallava, Pandya, and Vijayanagara periods developed characteristic sculptural styles while maintaining iconographic consistency. Chola bronzes achieve classical perfection; Pallava stone sculpture shows earlier dynamism; Vijayanagara work becomes more elaborate and ornate.

## Textual and Sculptural Traditions

A key contribution was demonstrating South Indian sculpture's adherence to Agamic and Shilpa Shastra prescriptions. These Sanskrit texts, compiled from roughly 6th-12th centuries, specified exact proportions, gestures, and attributes for divine images. Sculptors weren't creating freely but following precise manuals ensuring theological correctness.

Yet within these constraints, artistic excellence flourished. The great Chola bronzes from 10th-12th centuries show individual artistic genius working within iconographic rules—achieving grace, dynamism, and spiritual power while maintaining prescribed forms.

Krishna Sastri's documentation preserved knowledge of this tradition as it declined under colonial disruption. Traditional sculptors (shilpis) trained in family workshops were dying out; temple patronage had collapsed; iconographic knowledge was fragmenting. His work captured expertise that might otherwise have been lost.

## Archaeological Context

This publication emerged from the Archaeological Survey of India's systematic documentation of Indian art and architecture. Under John Marshall's directorship (1902-1928), the Survey shifted from British monument preservation to comprehensive Indian cultural heritage study. Indian archaeologists like Krishna Sastri played crucial roles in this transformation.

The Madras Government Museum, where Krishna Sastri worked, housed major collections of South Indian sculpture, particularly Chola bronzes. His curatorial work informed this iconographic study, combining museum collection analysis with field documentation of in situ temple sculpture.

## Legacy

Krishna Sastri's iconographic documentation influenced subsequent South Indian art history scholarship. His student C. Sivaramamurti would become the National Museum's first Indian director, producing definitive studies of South Indian sculpture building on Krishna Sastri's foundations.

For temple restoration and traditional sculptors reviving bronze-casting in the mid-20th century, works like this preserved iconographic knowledge essential for creating Agama-compliant images. The book became a reference for distinguishing authentic iconography from later innovations or corruptions.

Contemporary scholars recognize Krishna Sastri's work as pioneering Indian art history by Indians—archaeological rigor combined with cultural insider knowledge. His interpretations, rooted in both Western methodology and Sanskrit learning, offered alternatives to purely Western art historical frameworks.

## This Digital Edition

This Internet Archive preservation ensures continued access to foundational South Indian art history scholarship. For students of Hindu iconography, temple architecture, or Indian archaeology, Krishna Sastri's work provides detailed documentation of sculptural traditions central to South Indian religious and artistic heritage.
