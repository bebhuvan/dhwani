description: "The Mundaka Upanishad presents Vedantic philosophy through the fundamental distinction between higher knowledge (para vidya) of Brahman and lower knowledge (apara vidya) of phenomenal reality, establishing that ultimate liberation requires transcending empirical learning for direct realization. Composed around 5th century BCE, this text of three mundakas (sections) belongs to the Atharvaveda and contains the immortal verse 'Satyameva Jayate' (Truth Alone Triumphs)—adopted as India's national motto—expressing confidence that ultimate truth prevails over falsehood. The text employs powerful metaphors: two birds on one tree (individual self and universal Self), the bow-and-arrow of Om meditation, and the luminous Brahman in the heart's cave. Through systematic teaching progressing from ritual's limitations through renunciation to knowledge, the Mundaka guides seekers from worldly pursuits to transcendent realization. The work distinguishes itself through poetic beauty combined with philosophical rigor, establishing frameworks influencing Shankara's Advaita commentary, Buddhist critiques of eternalism, and global philosophical discussions on knowledge epistemology and spiritual liberation."
