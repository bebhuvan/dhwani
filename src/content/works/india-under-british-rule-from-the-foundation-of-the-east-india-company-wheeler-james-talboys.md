## Historical Context

India Under British Rule from the Foundation of the East India Company" by J. Talboys Wheeler is a historical account written in the late 19th century. The book provides an in-depth exploration of British colonial rule in India, focusing on the formation and evolution of power held by the East India Company and its significant impact on Indian society and politics. The opening of the work introduces the reader to the backdrop of British expansion into India starting from the establishment of the East India Company in the early 17th century. Wheeler outlines the critical interactions between British traders and local rulers, detailing the foundation of settlements such as Madras and Bombay, while also referencing the complex socio-political environment shaped by Hindu and Mohammedan influences. He emphasizes the initial challenges faced by the British as they negotiated power dynamics with the Great Mogul and other regional rulers, leading up to a narrative rich with intrigue, military conflicts, and the gradual establishment of British supremacy. The text hints at deeper discussions on warfare, governance, and the sociopolitical changes that occurred in response to colonial rule, setting the stage for the subsequent chapters that will elaborate on these themes.

# India Under British Rule from the Foundation of the East India Company

## Overview

James Talboys Wheeler's "India Under British Rule from the Foundation of the East India Company" (first published 1882, revised edition 1886) stands as one of the foundational texts of British colonial historiography on India. Published by Macmillan and Co. in London, this comprehensive 339-page historical survey traces the trajectory of British involvement in India from the early commercial ventures of the East India Company in the seventeenth century through the establishment of direct Crown rule following the upheavals of 1857. Wheeler's work represents a critical moment in the codification of colonial historical narratives, offering both valuable documentary evidence and revealing the ideological frameworks through which Victorian Britain understood its imperial project in South Asia.

James Talboys Wheeler (1824-1897) was uniquely positioned to write this history, having served as a bureaucrat-historian of the British Raj with direct access to governmental archives and records. After an unsuccessful early career as a publisher and bookseller in England, Wheeler reinvented himself as a colonial administrator and scholar. In 1858, he arrived in India to become editor of the Madras Spectator, later serving as professor of Moral and Mental Philosophy at Madras Presidency College (1858-1862), where his interest in Hindu customs and Indian history deepened. He subsequently held important administrative positions, including Assistant Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department (1862-1870), and Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of British Burma (1870-1873). This combination of scholarly interest and bureaucratic access to official records made Wheeler one of the first European historians of India to rely extensively on documentary sources rather than purely literary or anecdotal evidence. His comprehensive five-volume "History of India" (1867-1876) preceded this more focused work on British rule, establishing him as a prolific compiler and record-keeper, if not an original thinker in historical interpretation.

"India Under British Rule" exemplifies the Documentary School of colonial historiography, emphasizing governmental records, treaties, and official correspondence as primary sources. Wheeler's approach was methodical and detailed, chronicling the East India Company's transformation from a commercial enterprise seeking trade privileges to a territorial power exercising sovereignty over vast Indian territories. The narrative traces key developments including the establishment of settlements at Madras and Bombay, the complex negotiations with Mughal emperors and regional rulers, the military conquests in Bengal, the Carnatic Wars against French rivals, the expansion into princely states, and ultimately the transfer of power from Company to Crown following the 1857 Rebellion. Throughout, Wheeler presents British expansion as a largely inevitable and progressive force, shaped by what he portrays as the inherent instability and decline of indigenous political systems. His work reflects the Victorian conviction that British rule brought order, law, and civilization to India, though modern scholarship recognizes this as a deeply problematic colonial framing that obscures Indian agency, resistance, and the extractive violence of imperial conquest.

While Wheeler's historical interpretations must be read critically today, the work retains significant value as a primary source document itself. His extensive citations of treaties, dispatches, and governmental records provide researchers with access to materials that might otherwise be difficult to locate. The book reveals how colonial administrators understood and justified their own actions, offering insight into the intellectual and ideological apparatus of empire. For scholars of historiography, Wheeler's work demonstrates the methods and assumptions of Victorian colonial historical writing, showing how history was instrumentalized to legitimize British dominance. The text also captures the transition period in British India, written in the aftermath of the 1857 Rebellion and the formal assumption of Crown rule in 1858, reflecting anxieties and justifications particular to that historical moment. Contemporary readers should approach this work with awareness of its colonial perspective, recognizing both its documentary value and its role in constructing narratives that marginalized Indian voices and experiences. When read alongside anti-colonial historiography and Indian nationalist historical writings, Wheeler's account becomes part of a larger conversation about power, knowledge production, and the contested meanings of India's colonial past.
