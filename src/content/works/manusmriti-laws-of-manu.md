description: "The Manusmriti (Laws of Manu) stands as ancient India's most influential legal and ethical code, systematizing dharmashastra (righteous law) through approximately 2,700 verses covering cosmology, ethics, social duties, kingship, justice, and liberation. Composed between 200 BCE and 200 CE, this foundational text establishes varnashrama-dharma (duties according to caste and life-stage), prescribes conduct for kings, householders, students, and ascetics, and addresses civil/criminal law, inheritance, marriage, and ritual purity. Beyond legal prescriptions, the work presents comprehensive worldview: cosmic order (rita), dharma's primacy, karma-rebirth mechanics, and moksha as ultimate goal. The Manusmriti profoundly influenced Hindu society's organization for two millennia, inspiring commentaries, regional legal codes, and dharmashastra literature, while simultaneously proving controversial for caste hierarchy codification and women's subordination. George Bühler's critical English translation (1886) made this civilization-shaping text accessible to modern scholarship, revealing its historical importance while enabling contemporary critique of its hierarchical social vision."
