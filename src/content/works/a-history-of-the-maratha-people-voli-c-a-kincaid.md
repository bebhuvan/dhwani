# A History of the Maratha People (Volume I)

Charles Augustus Kincaid and Rao Bahadur Dattatray Balwant Parasnis's collaborative *A History of the Maratha People*, published in three volumes between 1918 and 1925, represents a distinctive moment in colonial historiography when British administrative authority intersected with indigenous scholarly expertise. This partnership between an Indian Civil Service officer and a prominent Marathi historian produced a work that, despite colonial institutional constraints, attempted more sympathetic engagement with Maratha perspectives than earlier British histories. The collaboration's very existence—and the controversy surrounding its publication—illuminates the complex negotiations of knowledge, power, and representation characterizing late colonial scholarship.

## Author Backgrounds and Collaborative Context

Charles Augustus Kincaid (1870-1954), decorated with the Commander of the Royal Victorian Order, embodied the late colonial administrator-scholar type. Born to Major-General William Kincaid, who had served as Resident of Bhopal, C. A. Kincaid inherited family connections to India's princely state system. Educated at Sherborne, he entered the Indian Civil Service, eventually serving as high court judge in colonial India while pursuing prolific literary and historical output. His son Dennis Kincaid continued this tradition, becoming a civil servant and author of *British Social Life in India, 1608-1937*.

Kincaid's administrative position granted access to state archives, official records, and elite Indian informants while situating him within power structures that shaped historical interpretation. As ICS officer and high court judge, he represented imperial authority even as his scholarly interests drew him toward sympathetic engagement with Indian history and culture. This dual positioning—colonial official and cultural enthusiast—created productive tensions and limitations within his historical work.

Rao Bahadur Dattatray Balwant Parasnis (1870-1926) represented indigenous scholarly tradition's accommodation with and resistance to colonial frameworks. Born November 27, 1870, into a traditional middle-class Deshastha Brahmin family in Satara, Parasnis became a distinguished historian specializing in Maratha history. The British government honored him with the title "Rao Bahadur" in 1913, recognizing his scholarship, and granted him a lifelong pension of 200 rupees monthly from the Government of Bombay—colonial patronage that enabled scholarly work while binding him to imperial recognition systems.

Parasnis's scholarship preceded and extended beyond the Kincaid collaboration. His 1894 biography of Maharani Lakshmibai of Jhansi, *Maharani Laxmibaisaheb Yanche Charitra*, based on interviews with Dhanodar Rao, the Rani's adopted son then still living, demonstrated commitment to oral history and indigenous perspectives. He authored biographies of Baija Bai of Gwalior and Bramhendra Swami, published *Poona in Bygone Times* (1921), and edited two monthly magazines—*Bharatavarsha* (two years) and *Ithihasa Sangraha* (seven years from August 1907)—dedicated to historical letters and documents. This scholarly output established Parasnis as authoritative voice on Maratha history, grounded in Marathi-language sources and indigenous historiographical traditions.

The collaboration between British administrator and Indian scholar reflected both colonial knowledge hierarchies and possibilities for indigenous expertise's partial recognition. Kincaid brought institutional access, English-language publishing networks, and colonial scholarly credibility; Parasnis contributed deep archival knowledge, linguistic expertise in Marathi and Persian, and connections to indigenous historical traditions. This asymmetric partnership produced work that, while bearing colonial imprimatur, incorporated indigenous perspectives more substantially than earlier British Maratha histories.

## Scholarly Sources and Methodological Approach

The collaborative history drew on remarkably diverse source materials reflecting both authors' complementary expertise. Parasnis's decades of archival work in Marathi bakhars (chronicles), family archives, temple records, and Persian-language court documents provided foundation. His editorial work publishing historical correspondence in *Bharatavarsha* and *Ithihasa Sangraha* had assembled substantial primary source collections. Kincaid's administrative access supplemented these with British official records, East India Company correspondence, and colonial archival materials.

Critically, the work engaged "local histories into context, not just official histories," producing what contemporary readers describe as "thoroughly researched work that feels like an Indian wrote about their history." This methodological choice—privileging indigenous source materials and historiographical frameworks alongside colonial records—distinguished the work from earlier British histories that relied primarily on Company sources and European travelogues. The collaboration's structure allowed Parasnis's expertise in Marathi sources and indigenous historical consciousness to shape narrative construction, even as Kincaid's role as senior British author provided colonial legitimacy necessary for publication.

Volume I, covering the earliest times through Shivaji's death, established chronological framework and interpretative approach. The narrative drew on traditional Maratha genealogies, temple inscriptions, folk traditions, and early modern chronicles—sources often dismissed by British historians as unreliable but central to indigenous historical understanding. This methodological pluralism reflected negotiation between European historical criticism's documentary standards and recognition that oral traditions and indigenous chronicles contained valuable historical knowledge excluded by narrow documentary positivism.

The work's treatment of Shivaji exemplified this approach. Rather than recycling British characterizations of Shivaji as mountain chieftain or freebooter, the narrative engaged Marathi sources presenting him as righteous king (dharmic ruler) resisting foreign oppression and establishing Hindu sovereignty. While not uncritically accepting hagiographic traditions, the history accorded them serious consideration as expressing Maratha self-understanding and political ideology. This relatively sympathetic portrayal proved controversial within colonial administrative circles.

## Publication Controversy and Colonial Censorship

The collaboration's most revealing aspect may be the controversy surrounding its publication. Significantly, "higher in command requested that the book not be published because of its favorable portrayal of some Indian figures." This attempted suppression illuminates colonial knowledge politics and the boundaries of acceptable historical narrative within imperial order. That British authorities deemed the work's sympathetic treatment of Maratha leaders threatening reveals anxieties about how historical narratives might inform contemporary anti-colonial consciousness.

The censorship attempt reflected broader colonial concerns about Indian historical heroes providing models for resistance. In the early twentieth century, as Indian nationalism mobilized historical memory—invoking Shivaji, the Rani of Jhansi, and other figures who had resisted foreign rule—colonial authorities increasingly monitored historical writing for politically dangerous content. Kincaid and Parasnis's work, by presenting Maratha leaders as legitimate state-builders and complex political actors rather than primitive chieftains or despotic tyrants, implicitly challenged colonial legitimacy.

That the work was ultimately published despite official objections suggests the authors possessed sufficient institutional capital and scholarly credibility to resist complete censorship. Kincaid's status as decorated ICS officer and high court judge, combined with Parasnis's Rao Bahadur title and scholarly reputation, provided protective authority. The episode nonetheless demonstrates how colonial power attempted to police historical knowledge production, constraining what could be written and published about Indian history even when research undermined colonial narratives.

The controversy also reveals tensions within colonial administration between hardline political control and liberal scholarly traditions. Some British officials recognized value in relatively sophisticated, sympathetic historical work that might win educated Indian cooperation, even as security-minded administrators feared any narrative that validated indigenous resistance or political autonomy. The Kincaid-Parasnis collaboration occupied this contested terrain between colonial knowledge extraction and indigenous historical agency.

## Contemporary Reception and Educational Impact

The history's reception divided along predictable lines of colonial institutional power and Indian nationalist sentiment. Within colonial educational institutions, the work achieved recognition as more sophisticated than earlier British Maratha histories, valued for documentary richness and cultural sensitivity. British scholars praised its archival depth while sometimes expressing discomfort with sympathetic treatment of figures who had resisted British expansion. The work became reference point for subsequent Maratha scholarship, cited by both colonial and nationalist historians.

Among educated Indians, particularly Marathi-speaking communities, the collaboration received mixed assessment. Some appreciated that a work bearing British scholarly imprimatur presented Maratha history more favorably than Grant Duff's influential but prejudiced earlier history. The involvement of Rao Bahadur Parasnis, respected indigenous scholar, lent credibility within Indian scholarly circles. However, others critiqued both authors' accommodation with colonial structures—Kincaid as ICS officer, Parasnis as Rao Bahadur receiving British patronage—viewing the history as compromised by imperial frameworks despite sympathetic content.

The work's use in colonial education systems proved significant. Unlike Grant Duff's history, which had been translated into Indian languages and made required reading, the Kincaid-Parasnis collaboration achieved more limited circulation, perhaps reflecting administrative ambivalence given the publication controversy. Nonetheless, it influenced subsequent textbook writing and shaped how Maratha history was taught in English-medium schools and colleges, providing alternative to the most crude colonial stereotypes while remaining within acceptable bounds of imperial historiography.

## Postcolonial Reassessment and Contemporary Significance

Modern scholarship approaches the Kincaid-Parasnis collaboration as complex artifact of late colonial knowledge production, reflecting both persistent colonial power asymmetries and spaces for indigenous expertise's partial recognition. Contemporary analysis notes how "Kincaid worked with an Indian historian, Dattatray Balwant Parasnis, when compiling information. Kincaid and Parasnis took local histories into context, not just official histories, resulting in a thoroughly researched work that feels like an Indian wrote about their history."

This assessment captures the work's ambiguous positioning. The collaboration represented genuine, if constrained, engagement with indigenous sources and perspectives. Parasnis's involvement ensured that Marathi bakhars, family archives, and oral traditions shaped the narrative in ways earlier British histories had excluded. The methodological commitment to "local histories" challenged colonial historiography's privileging of official Company records and European observations. In this sense, the work advanced beyond James Grant Duff's influential but deeply prejudiced earlier history.

However, postcolonial critique also recognizes fundamental limitations imposed by colonial institutional frameworks. Despite Parasnis's expertise and contributions, the work appeared under joint authorship with British author's name listed first, reflecting colonial hierarchies of scholarly authority. The narrative, while more sympathetic than earlier British histories, remained constrained by acceptable bounds of colonial discourse—it could not fundamentally challenge imperial legitimacy or present Maratha resistance as morally superior to British conquest. The very fact of British administrative approval (despite initial resistance) indicates the work ultimately reinforced rather than subverted colonial knowledge structures.

Contemporary historians particularly examine how the collaboration navigated "Eurocentric origin story" problems endemic to colonial Indian historiography. Colonial scholarship frequently "attempted to establish India's history in alignment to their history, which naturally led to the omission of some histories, the slandering of different people, and the intentional ignorance of the efforts of groups and individuals." The Kincaid-Parasnis work partially resisted these tendencies by centering indigenous sources and Maratha perspectives, yet remained embedded within European historiographical frameworks regarding periodization, causal explanation, and narrative structure.

The work's treatment of non-elite actors and subaltern groups reveals colonial historiography's persistent limitations even in relatively sympathetic texts. Like earlier political histories, the narrative focused primarily on elite political and military actors—rulers, generals, administrators—while marginalized perspectives of peasants, artisans, women, and lower-caste groups whose labor sustained Maratha state and society. This elite bias reflected both authors' social positioning—British administrator and Brahmin scholar—and nineteenth-century historiography's conventional focus on great men and political events.

Reassessment also considers the collaboration's significance for understanding indigenous scholarly agency under colonialism. Parasnis's involvement represents neither complete capitulation to colonial knowledge systems nor fully autonomous indigenous scholarship. Rather, he navigated available opportunities within colonial institutional structures, using British partnership to access publishing resources and wider audiences while attempting to incorporate indigenous historical consciousness. This strategic negotiation—accepting colonial honors and patronage while working to preserve and disseminate Marathi historical traditions—characterized many colonized intellectuals' complex positioning.

Contemporary Maratha historiography, particularly Marathi-language scholarship, has built upon while transcending the Kincaid-Parasnis foundation. Modern historians access the same archival materials Parasnis utilized while rejecting colonial frameworks and centering indigenous historiographical traditions. Research emphasizes social history, economic structures, cultural patronage, and subaltern agency largely absent from political histories. Feminist scholarship recovers women's roles marginalized in male-centered narratives. Dalit historiography challenges upper-caste perspectives that both Parasnis and Kincaid, despite their sympathies, uncritically reproduced.

The collaboration ultimately serves contemporary scholarship less as authoritative historical account than as document illuminating late colonial knowledge production's contradictions and possibilities. It demonstrates how indigenous scholarly expertise could achieve partial recognition within colonial institutions while revealing structural constraints preventing full decolonization of historical knowledge. The work's sympathetic treatment of Maratha leaders, controversial enough to provoke colonial censorship attempts, appears modest compared to post-independence nationalist and subaltern historiographies, yet represented meaningful intervention within its contemporary context.

Decolonizing Maratha history requires moving beyond both crude colonial prejudice exemplified by Grant Duff and the limited sympathies of the Kincaid-Parasnis collaboration. This involves not merely recovering indigenous sources—which the collaboration partially achieved—but fundamentally reconceptualizing historical questions, categories, and narratives from perspectives centered on colonized peoples' experiences, agency, and self-understanding. The collaboration's mixed legacy reminds contemporary scholars how colonial power shaped even relatively sympathetic historical work, while Parasnis's scholarly contributions model indigenous expertise's persistence and partial autonomy within constraining imperial structures.
