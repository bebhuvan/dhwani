year: 1925

description: "Published in three volumes between 1918-1925, this comprehensive history documents the Maratha confederacy's rise from 17th-century regional power to dominant force controlling much of India, culminating in defeat by the British in the early 19th century. Colonial authorities initially blocked publication for its sympathetic portrayal of Maratha figures, revealing tensions in how Indian resistance was depicted under the Raj."
