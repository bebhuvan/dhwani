# A History of the Maratha People

## Overview

Published in three volumes between 1918-1925, this comprehensive history documents the Maratha confederacy's rise from 17th-century regional power to dominant force controlling much of India, culminating in defeat by the British in the early 19th century. The work represents unusual collaboration between Charles Augustus Kincaid, British ICS administrator and judge, and Dattatray Balwant Parasnis, Marathi historian expert in Modi script manuscripts and Maratha archival sources.

The volumes trace Maratha history from Shivaji's establishment of Hindavi Swarajya (Hindu self-rule) in defiance of Mughal and Bijapur Sultanate authority, through the Peshwa period when Maratha power extended from the Deccan across northern and central India, to the three Anglo-Maratha Wars (1775-1818) that ended Maratha independence. The authors analyze military tactics, administrative systems, diplomatic relations, internal conflicts, and cultural achievements—presenting the Marathas as formidable power rather than mere obstacle to British dominion.

Colonial authorities initially suppressed publication, uncomfortable with the sympathetic portrayal of figures who had resisted British expansion. This censorship reveals tensions in colonial historiography: how to acknowledge indigenous political sophistication while justifying British conquest.

## About the Authors

**Charles Augustus Kincaid (1870-1954)** joined the Indian Civil Service, serving in Bombay Presidency as administrator and eventually High Court judge. Member of the Imperial Legislative Council and awarded Commander of the Royal Victorian Order, he represented establishment colonial authority. Yet Kincaid developed deep interest in Maratha history and Indian folklore, learning Marathi and studying regional sources. His numerous works on Indian history and folk tales showed genuine engagement with indigenous culture, though filtered through colonial perspectives.

Kincaid's son Dennis also became ICS officer and author, continuing his father's literary interests. The family represented the scholar-administrator tradition that produced much colonial-era Indian historiography—men with administrative power who pursued serious historical research, combining firsthand knowledge of governance with archival scholarship.

**Dattatray Balwant Parasnis (1870-1926)**, born into Deshastha Brahmin family in Satara, mastered Modi script—the cursive Marathi script used in Maratha administration—giving him access to unpublished documents in regional archives. Honored with Rao Bahadur title (1913), he published biographies of Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi (1894) and other historical figures, edited historical magazines (*Bharatavarsha*, *Itihasa Sangraha*), and documented Pune's history in *Poona in Bygone Times* (1921).

Parasnis interviewed surviving witnesses to 19th-century events, consulted family archives, and translated Modi documents inaccessible to British scholars. His collaboration with Kincaid brought indigenous sources and Marathi perspective to complement British archival records and administrative viewpoint. Parasnis died in 1926, shortly after the final volume's publication.

## Maratha History and Legacy

The Maratha confederacy fundamentally shaped modern India's political geography and cultural identity:

**Shivaji Maharaj (1630-1680)**: The volumes document Shivaji's transformation from regional chieftain to independent sovereign, establishing fortified strongholds across the Western Ghats, developing guerrilla warfare tactics (ganimi kava) against Mughal armies, building naval forces to contest Portuguese and Mughal maritime power, and creating administrative systems combining Deccan traditions with innovative revenue and military reforms. His 1674 coronation as Chhatrapati asserted Hindu sovereignty against Muslim sultanates and Mughal empire.

**Peshwa Expansion (1713-1818)**: Under hereditary Peshwa (prime ministers) effectively ruling in Chhatrapatis' name, Maratha power expanded dramatically. The confederacy's sardars (chiefs)—Holkar, Scindia, Gaekwad, Bhonsle—controlled territories from Gujarat to Bengal, extracting chauth (protection tribute) and establishing parallel power structure challenging Mughal authority even as that empire declined. The work analyzes internal rivalries between Peshwa's direct territories and nominally subordinate Maratha states.

**Third Battle of Panipat (1761)**: The catastrophic defeat by Ahmad Shah Durrani's Afghan forces killed perhaps 100,000 Maratha soldiers and civilians, decimating a generation of leadership. Kincaid and Parasnis examine the battle's strategic errors, logistical failures, and devastating impact on Maratha power—a turning point enabling subsequent British expansion.

**Anglo-Maratha Wars**: Three wars (1775-1782, 1803-1805, 1817-1818) progressively destroyed Maratha independence. The authors document British diplomatic manipulation of internal Maratha rivalries, superior artillery and disciplined infantry defeating Maratha cavalry, and final annexations that made the Peshwa's territories and allied states into British protectorates or direct British rule.

## Collaborative Methodology and Sources

The Kincaid-Parasnis collaboration combined complementary expertise: Kincaid brought British military and administrative records, East India Company documents, English-language sources, and colonial administrative perspective; Parasnis contributed Modi script manuscripts, Marathi chronicles (*bakhars*), family archives, temple records, and indigenous historical understanding.

This methodology produced more comprehensive history than either author alone could create. British sources documented warfare, diplomacy, and British perspectives on Maratha governance; Marathi sources revealed internal Maratha politics, cultural context, local perspectives on events, and details missing from colonial archives.

The authors correlated sources, acknowledged contradictions, and attempted balanced narrative—though inevitably their own cultural positions shaped interpretations. Kincaid's administrative experience informed analysis of Maratha governance; Parasnis's cultural insider knowledge contextualized religious, social, and linguistic dimensions.

## Colonial Politics and Censorship

British authorities' attempt to suppress publication reveals colonial anxieties about acknowledging indigenous political achievement. A sympathetic portrayal of Maratha resistance to British conquest potentially undermined imperial legitimacy. If Marathas appeared as sophisticated political actors defending independence rather than chaotic polities benefiting from British order, the moral foundation of British rule weakened.

The eventual publication—possibly after revisions or due to changing political climate—suggests limits to censorship and growing acceptance that serious historical scholarship required acknowledging Indian political agency. By the 1920s, with Indian nationalism strengthening and eventual self-governance becoming conceivable, rigid suppression of sympathetic indigenous history became counterproductive.

For Indian readers, particularly Marathas, the work validated regional pride and historical consciousness. Shivaji and the Marathas became icons of Hindu resistance and indigenous sovereignty, symbolically important to nationalist movements. The British co-author's respectful treatment added legitimacy, though some Indian nationalists preferred purely indigenous historiography.

## Critical Perspective

Modern scholars note the work's limitations: overemphasis on military and political narrative at the expense of social and economic history; insufficient attention to peasant perspectives versus elite politics; romanticization of Maratha leadership; colonial-era frameworks about "progress" and "civilization"; and Brahmin-centric narrative marginalizing lower-caste experiences.

Post-independence Maratha historians have produced more critical scholarship, examining internal contradictions, exploitative aspects of Maratha rule, and diverse regional experiences. Yet Kincaid-Parasnis established documentary foundation and demonstrated that serious Maratha history required both British administrative records and indigenous Marathi sources.

## This Digital Edition

These Internet Archive volumes provide access to landmark collaborative history documenting the Maratha confederacy's rise and fall. For students of Indian history, military history, or colonial historiography, the work offers detailed narrative based on extensive sources, insight into early 20th-century historical methods, and example of cross-cultural scholarly collaboration—however unequal the power dynamics between British administrator and Indian scholar in colonial context.
