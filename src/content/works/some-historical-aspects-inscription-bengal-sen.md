  Benoychandra Sen's "Some Historical Aspects of the Inscriptions of Bengal: Pre-Muhammadan Epochs," published by University of Calcutta in 1942, represents monumental 700-page scholarly study systematically analyzing epigraphic records from ancient and medieval Bengal to reconstruct political history, dynastic chronologies, and administrative structures of the pre-Islamic period (approximately 5th-13th centuries CE). This comprehensive work emerged from Sen's decade-long research beginning in 1926 when University of Calcutta appointed him lecturer teaching epigraphy and palaeography, culminating in European research stay (1930-1932) examining manuscript collections and comparative epigraphic materials. The study systematically examined major dynastic periods including Gupta imperial inscriptions, post-Gupta regional powers, Pala dynasty (c. 750-1161 CE) whose copper-plate grants documented Buddhist imperial power and university patronage at Nalanda and Vikramashila, Sena dynasty (c. 1070-1230 CE) documenting Brahminical revival and caste hierarchies, and minor contemporary dynasties. Sen's analysis employed palaeographic dating through script evolution, diplomatic study of inscriptional formulae, linguistic analysis of Sanskrit features, and prosopographic reconstruction building genealogies from fragmentary evidence. The work established comprehensive catalogue of known inscriptions serving as foundational reference for Bengal historiography, contributing to professionalization of Indian historical studies through specialized epigraphy employing technical expertise and comparative philology.

## Epigraphic History and Bengali Historiography

"Some Historical Aspects of the Inscriptions of Bengal" exemplified methodological transformation in Indian historical scholarship during colonial and early nationalist periods, when historians increasingly recognized inscriptions as primary sources offering uniquely reliable historical evidence compared to literary texts, mythological chronicles, and retrospective accounts subject to legendary accretion and ideological distortion. Epigraphy—systematic study of inscriptions including their content, script evolution, material characteristics, and historical contexts—emerged as specialized subdiscipline requiring technical expertise in palaeography (historical script analysis), diplomatic (documentary forms and formulae), Sanskrit and Prakrit languages, comparative philology, chronological reconstruction, and integration with archaeological, numismatic, and literary evidence. Inscriptions possessed distinctive advantages as historical sources: contemporary with events or periods described rather than later narratives, commissioned for administrative or religious purposes preserving authentic documentary information about land grants, tax regulations, royal genealogies, and religious endowments, resistant to textual corruption through copying unlike literary manuscripts transmitted through generations, and preserving original language and script enabling linguistic analysis revealing grammatical features, vocabulary, and stylistic conventions providing chronological and regional markers. Bengal's epigraphic corpus particularly rich in copper-plate grants (tamrashasana) recording royal land donations to Brahmin beneficiaries or Buddhist and Hindu religious institutions, documenting administrative structures, territorial boundaries, genealogical relationships, and socio-economic conditions of pre-Islamic period approximately 5th-13th centuries CE. Stone inscriptions including temple foundations, commemorative pillars, and cave dedications supplemented copper-plates, sometimes documenting merchant guilds, local chiefs, and sectarian institutions' activities beyond royal administration. Benoychandra Sen's systematic compilation and analysis represented culmination of earlier epigraphic work by European and Indian scholars including British Archaeological Survey's documentation, Bengali scholars' growing involvement in indigenous source interpretation, and University of Calcutta's institutional support establishing epigraphy as core historical methodology.

## Major Dynasties and Political History from Inscriptions

Sen's comprehensive treatment reconstructed Bengal's pre-Islamic political history through systematic analysis of dynastic inscriptions. **Gupta imperial period** (4th-5th centuries CE) integrated Bengal into north Indian empire, with inscriptions documenting administrative integration while indicating regional chiefs' subordinate status and local governance continuities beneath imperial superstructure. **Post-Gupta fragmentation** (6th-8th centuries) produced multiple regional powers as central authority collapsed: inscriptions documented Gaudas asserting independence, Varmans controlling eastern Bengal, and various local chiefs claiming royal titles and administrative functions previously monopolized by imperial bureaucracy—period characterized by political instability, frequent dynastic changes, and territorial fluidity reflected in inscriptions' limited geographical distribution and sometimes contradictory claims. **Pala dynasty** (c. 750-1161 CE) established stable Buddhist imperial power controlling Bihar and Bengal for four centuries, with extensive inscriptional corpus documenting: genealogical sequences from founder Gopala through imperial zenith under Dharmapala and Devapala to later decline; territorial extent reaching maximum expansion incorporating Assam, Orissa, and northern India before contracting to Bengal-Bihar core; administrative organization including hierarchical officialdom, revenue systems, and military establishments; religious patronage founding and endowing Buddhist universities at Nalanda, Vikramashila, Odantapuri, and Somapura supporting Mahayana and Tantric traditions; cultural achievements including Sanskrit literary production, architectural monuments, and artistic patronage; and eventual territorial losses to Pratihara and Rashtrakuta rivals followed by resurgence under later kings before final displacement by Senas. **Sena dynasty** (c. 1070-1230 CE) marked religious transition from Buddhist to Brahminical rule, with inscriptions documenting: genealogical claims tracing descent from Karnataka before Bengal migration establishing dynasty; territorial control gradually expanding from initial eastern Bengal base to encompass former Pala territories; administrative continuities with Pala predecessors despite religious shift; elaborate Brahminical rituals and temple endowments marking official restoration of orthodox Hinduism; social stratification through emerging kulinism and caste hierarchy formalization; cultural efflorescence in Sanskrit literature especially court poetry; and eventual displacement by Islamic conquest beginning early 13th century. **Minor contemporary dynasties** including Chandras of southeastern Bengal and Kamboja Varmans ruled territories peripheral to main kingdoms, with inscriptions documenting regional diversity, cultural variations, and political fragmentation within broader Bengali identity.

## Copper-Plate Grants and Administrative Documentation

Copper-plate inscriptions constituted primary epigraphic evidence for reconstructing pre-Islamic Bengal's political and administrative history, following formulaic structure enabling comparative analysis while variations revealed individual circumstances and temporal developments. Typical **compositional structure** included: **invocatory verses** (mangalacharana) praising patron deity—Hindu inscriptions invoking Vishnu, Shiva, or Goddess; Buddhist inscriptions venerating Buddha or bodhisattvas—employing elaborate Sanskrit poetry with mythological allusions and religious symbolism; **genealogical preamble** (prasasti) establishing ruler's legitimacy through descent, often tracing ancestry to legendary figures, mythological origins, or prestigious lineages while narrating dynasty's founding, territorial expansion, and illustrious predecessors' achievements through hyperbolic poetic description; **donor's virtues and achievements** (guna-varnan) eulogizing reigning king's personal qualities including valor, learning, generosity, justice, and piety through conventional epithets and sometimes specific military victories or administrative accomplishments; **administrative context** specifying issuing date using regnal years or calendrical systems, administrative division (vishaya, mandala) where donated land located, and officials involved in transaction including ministers, scribes, and local administrators; **grant specification** describing donated land's location, boundaries, area measurement, and agricultural productivity, listing tax exemptions and administrative privileges granted beneficiary including freedom from various impositions and rights to collect certain revenues; **beneficiary identification** naming recipient Brahmin or religious institution with lineage, Vedic school affiliation, or sectarian identity indicating donor's religious patronage preferences; **witnessing and validation** listing officials, local notables, or community representatives attesting transaction's legitimacy; and **imprecatory verses** cursing future rulers who might violate grant, promising hell punishments and karmic retribution while praising those respecting predecessors' donations—conventional formula employing Sanskrit quotations from Puranas and dharmashastra texts establishing religious-legal obligation to maintain charitable endowments.

## Methodological Challenges and Historical Interpretation

Sen necessarily confronted methodological challenges inherent in using epigraphic sources for historical reconstruction. **Fragmentary preservation** meant many inscriptions survived only partially through physical damage, or were known solely through unreliable early transcriptions, or remained undiscovered in private collections or unexplored sites, creating incomplete documentation requiring cautious generalization from available evidence. **Formulaic language** employing conventional epithets, standardized genealogical praise, and hyperbolic description of royal virtues made distinguishing sincere claims from conventional flattery difficult—requiring source criticism evaluating which details represented actual historical facts versus literary embellishment. **Elite bias** reflected donors' and patrons' perspectives: inscriptions documented ruling classes' administrative activities, religious endowments, and self-representation while largely silencing peasant cultivators, artisans, merchants, and marginalized communities lacking resources for permanent commemoration or excluded from Sanskrit literary culture dominating official inscriptions. **Political propaganda** presented idealized rule emphasizing legitimacy, territorial control, and benevolent governance while suppressing failures, defeats, internal conflicts, and oppressive measures—requiring critical evaluation comparing multiple sources and considering what inscriptions' silences might reveal. **Dating uncertainties** complicated chronological reconstruction: many inscriptions lacked absolute dates, using only regnal years without specifying king's accession date; palaeographic dating based on script evolution provided only approximate chronology within century or half-century ranges; and astronomical calculations from mentioned eclipses or planetary positions sometimes yielded multiple possible dates requiring additional evidence for resolution. Sen's analysis presumably addressed these challenges through comparative methods: cross-referencing multiple inscriptions mentioning same rulers, events, or localities; comparing epigraphic evidence with literary sources, numismatic evidence, and archaeological contexts; applying linguistic and palaeographic analysis for internal dating criteria; and maintaining critical skepticism about propagandistic claims while extracting reliable factual information from formulaic conventions.

## Historiographical Significance and Scholarly Legacy

Sen's monumental study established foundational reference for Bengal's pre-Islamic political history, influencing subsequent generations of historians while exemplifying early twentieth-century Indian historical scholarship's methodological rigor and nationalist cultural project. The work's immediate contributions included: comprehensive compilation cataloguing known inscriptions providing essential reference for future research; systematic analysis establishing chronologies, genealogies, and territorial reconstructions forming baseline for Bengal historiography; methodological exemplar demonstrating proper epigraphic techniques for dating, interpretation, and historical synthesis; and assertion of Indian scholarly autonomy as indigenous historian claimed interpretive authority over native sources previously dominated by European Orientalists. Sen's research coincided with Bengal Renaissance and nationalist movements emphasizing ancient India's civilizational achievements, making epigraphic study serve dual purposes: developing professional academic history employing scientific methods comparable to European historical scholarship, and recovering indigenous history suppressed or misrepresented by colonial narratives denying India's historical consciousness and sophisticated pre-colonial polities. Publication by University of Calcutta signaled institutional legitimization of epigraphic studies as core historical methodology warranting university resources and scholarly recognition. Subsequent scholarship built on Sen's foundation while expanding methodologies: Marxist historians analyzing inscriptions for class relations, agrarian structures, and economic exploitation evidence; social historians examining caste formation, gender relations, and marginalized groups' fragmentary traces; archaeological contextualization situating inscriptions within settlement patterns, material culture, and environmental contexts; and postcolonial critique examining how colonial and nationalist historiographies constructed particular narratives emphasizing political centralization, religious tolerance, or civilizational continuity through selective emphasis. Contemporary significance includes continued dependence on Sen's compilation despite theoretical and methodological advances in historiography, epigraphy, and South Asian studies over eight decades since publication—the work remains essential starting point requiring critical engagement rather than uncritical acceptance, providing documentary foundation and analytical framework that subsequent scholarship refines, challenges, and expands rather than replaces entirely.

## About Benoychandra Sen

**Benoychandra Sen** (also Benoy Chandra Sen) emerged as pioneering Bengali epigraphist and historian specializing in medieval Bengal's inscriptional sources. University of Calcutta appointed him lecturer in 1926 teaching epigraphy and palaeography with special reference to pre-Muhammadan Bengal inscriptions in Post-Graduate History department, beginning decade-long research culminating in major publications. European research stay October 1930-December 1932 enabled systematic examination of manuscript collections, archaeological reports, and comparative epigraphic materials in European libraries and museums, contributing to comprehensive mastery of Bengal's inscriptional corpus. His major works including "Some Historical Aspects of the Inscriptions of Bengal: Pre-Muhammadan Epochs" (1942) and companion volume "Inscriptions of Bengal" established him as authoritative interpreter of Bengal's pre-Islamic political history, training subsequent generations of historians in epigraphic methods while contributing to nationalist cultural project of recovering indigenous history through scientific scholarship. Sen's meticulous empirical research combined with interpretive sophistication exemplified mid-twentieth-century Indian historical scholarship's dual commitment to professional academic standards and cultural-political project of establishing Indian civilization's historical depth and sophistication.
