# Gommatsara Jīva-kāṇḍa (Volume 5)

## Overview

The Gommatsara is an encyclopedic Jain work in Prakrit by the great 10th-century systematizer Nemichandra Siddhanta Chakravarti. This fifth volume (440 pages, 1927, Central Jaina Publishing House, Lucknow) of J. L. Jaini's English translation focuses on the nature of the soul (jīva) and advanced karma theory—technical material at the heart of Jain spiritual practice.

## Content & Significance

Covers advanced Jain psychology and soteriology including gunasthānas (14 stages of spiritual development from complete delusion to liberation), detailed classification of karmic bondage types, and systematic exposition of consciousness purification leading to moksha. Represents Digambara tradition's most comprehensive treatment of how souls transmigrate and achieve liberation—essentially a medieval technical manual of spiritual mechanics far removed from popular religious literature. This 1927 translation was among the earliest attempts to render complex Jain karmic theory into English, making obscure technical material accessible to scholars. Essential for understanding Jain soteriology and karma metaphysics. Available through Archive.org (DLI collection), public domain.
