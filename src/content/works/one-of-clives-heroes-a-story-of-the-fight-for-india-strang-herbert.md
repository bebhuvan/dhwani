  Strang is an adventure novel written in the early 20th century. The story revolves
  around Robert Clive, a notable historical figure in Britain''s colonial exploits
  in India, and focuses on a young character named Desmond Burke, who aspires to rise
  above his mundane existence on a farm and emulate Clive''s remarkable life. The
  narrative combines historical events with fiction, aiming to entertain while also
  providing insights into the context of the period.  At the start of the story, readers
  are introduced to Desmond Burke, a young boy living in Market Drayton, who is enraptured
  by tales of Robert Clive''s adventures in India. The proceedings are marked by a
  banquet held in honor of Clive’s return, where Desmond yearns to be a part of the
  excitement. His older brother, Richard, is domineering and critical, which further
  drives Desmond''s dissatisfaction with his life. After a series of interactions,
  including Desmond''s encounter with a mysterious stranger named Marmaduke Diggle,
  who speaks of the wonders of the East Indies, Desmond is determined to pursue an
  adventurous life, setting the stage for his journey. The opening chapters establish
  his longing for adventure and introduce the conflicts that propel him towards a
  decisive turn in his life.'
