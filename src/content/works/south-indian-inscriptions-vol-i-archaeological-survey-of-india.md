  South Indian Inscriptions, Vol. I, published by the Archaeological Survey of India in 1890, represents a critical scholarly documentation of epigraphical records from the southern regions of India during the late 19th century colonial period. Compiled during the British administrative era, this comprehensive volume meticulously transcribes and translates stone and copper plate inscriptions that provide invaluable insights into the socio-political, economic, and cultural landscapes of medieval South Indian kingdoms. The work emerges from the systematic archaeological documentation efforts led by pioneering colonial-era scholars like Epigraphia Indica's editors, who recognized the profound historical significance of preserving indigenous textual heritage. These inscriptions predominantly span the Chola, Pandya, and Chera dynastic periods, offering detailed records of royal genealogies, administrative systems, land grants, religious endowments, and intricate social structures that defined pre-colonial South Indian civilization. The text is particularly significant for its linguistic diversity, featuring inscriptions in Tamil, Sanskrit, and transitional scripts that illuminate the complex linguistic interactions of the medieval period. Scholars of Indian history, anthropology, and linguistics find this volume crucial for understanding state formation, temple economies, agrarian systems, and cultural practices that shaped South Indian societies between the 7th and 14th centuries. By systematically documenting these primary historical sources, the Archaeological Survey of India not only preserved fragile historical records but also provided a foundational scholarly resource for subsequent generations of researchers seeking to comprehend the nuanced cultural and political dynamics of pre-colonial South India.

# South Indian Inscriptions, Vol. I

## Overview

*South Indian Inscriptions, Vol. I* represents the inaugural volume of a foundational epigraphic series published by the Archaeological Survey of India in 1890, edited and translated by Dr. E. Hultzsch, the first Government Epigraphist for India. This 199-page work, published by the Government Press, Madras, contains Tamil and Sanskrit inscriptions from stone and copper-plate edicts at Mamallapuram, Kanchipuram, in the North Arcot District, and other parts of the Madras Presidency, chiefly collected during the systematic survey of 1886-87. The volume emerged from the newly established Epigraphy Branch of the Archaeological Survey of India, founded in 1886 at Bangalore, marking the British administration's recognition of inscriptional evidence as critical primary sources for reconstructing India's historical record.

The publication inaugurated what would become a comprehensive 34-volume series documenting South Indian epigraphy from 1890 through the present. Dr. Hultzsch, a renowned German Indologist equally versed in Dravidian and Sanskritic epigraphy, laid a solid methodological foundation for epigraphical studies in India. His collaboration with V. Venkayya, who assisted with Tamil inscriptions, established systematic protocols for the survey, transcription, and publication of inscriptional materials. The volume includes texts in their original scripts—Tamil and Grantha—accompanied by English summaries and translations, establishing a publishing standard that balanced scholarly accuracy with accessibility.

Volume I focused primarily on Pallava dynasty inscriptions, particularly those from the architectural monuments at Mamallapuram (Mahabalipuram), including inscriptions on the Dharmarāja Ratha and other rock-cut temples constructed during the reigns of kings Simhavishnu (580-600 CE), Mahendravarman I, and Narasimhavarman I (who bore the title Mamalla, from which Mamallapuram derives its name), through Narasimhavarman II Rajasimha (700-728 CE). These inscriptions documented royal patronage, temple dedications, land grants, and religious endowments, providing unprecedented insight into the administrative, economic, and religious life of early medieval South India.

## About the Series

The South Indian Inscriptions series originated from the British colonial administration's initiative to systematically document India's epigraphic heritage, recognizing that inscriptional evidence offered irreplaceable historical data for a civilization whose ancient and medieval periods lacked extensive contemporary chronicles. The Epigraphy Branch, established in 1886, undertook comprehensive surveys across the Indian subcontinent, ultimately copying approximately 73,000 inscriptions from different regions. Of the roughly 100,000 inscriptions documented by the Archaeological Survey of India, approximately 60,000 were located in Tamil Nadu, making it the most densely inscribed region in India and necessitating dedicated publication series for South Indian materials.

Dr. E. Hultzsch's appointment as the first Government Epigraphist marked a professional turn in Indian epigraphy. His expertise in both Sanskrit and Dravidian languages enabled accurate readings and interpretations of multilingual inscriptions. The branch's systematic methodology involved physical survey expeditions, on-site copying of inscriptions, paleographic analysis for dating, comparative philological study, and historical contextualization within dynastic chronologies. Hultzsch and Venkayya rescued South Indian epigraphy from the obscurity to which it had been consigned prior to organized governmental efforts, establishing rigorous academic standards for the field.

The series provided comprehensive documentation including complete transcriptions in original scripts (Tamil, Grantha, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam), paleographic analysis for approximate dating, English summaries and translations, historical introductions contextualizing the inscriptions, and cross-referencing with other epigraphic and literary sources. This multi-layered approach transformed scattered inscriptional fragments into a coherent body of historical evidence, enabling scholars to reconstruct dynastic histories, administrative systems, economic transactions, religious practices, and social structures of medieval South India with unprecedented detail.

## The Work

Volume I concentrated on inscriptions from the Madras Presidency's northern regions, with particular emphasis on the Pallava monuments at Mamallapuram and the ancient capital at Kanchipuram. The inscriptions documented in this volume span approximately two centuries of Pallava rule, from the late 6th through early 8th centuries CE, covering the dynasty's period of greatest architectural and political achievement. The volume included both stone inscriptions carved on temple walls, rock faces, and architectural elements, and copper-plate grants documenting land transfers and royal charters.

The inscriptions employed two primary scripts: Tamil script for recording grants, administrative records, and vernacular religious texts, and Grantha script—developed and popularized by the Pallavas—for writing Sanskrit portions of bilingual inscriptions and Sanskritic technical terminology. The paleography of these inscriptions provided crucial chronological markers; the Grantha script documented in Volume I represented the archaic and ornamental period (6th-8th centuries), characterized by nail-headed letter forms visible in early Rajaraja-period inscriptions at Mahabalipuram. Paleographic analysis allowed Hultzsch to establish relative chronologies even for undated inscriptions by comparing letter forms, orthographic conventions, and stylistic features.

The content of these inscriptions proved invaluable for reconstructing Pallava administration and society. Land grant inscriptions (brahmadeya grants to Brahmin settlements) documented the creation of agrarian villages, taxation systems, irrigation rights, and property boundaries. Temple inscriptions recorded donations of land, gold, and other resources by kings, nobles, and commoners, revealing patronage networks and economic flows. Dedicatory inscriptions identified the deities to whom temples were consecrated, the names and titles of royal patrons, and the circumstances of temple construction. Many inscriptions included dating formulae using regnal years (the nth year of a king's reign), which Hultzsch used to establish precise chronologies for Pallava rulers and to correlate inscriptional evidence with genealogical records from copper-plate grants.

The volume's introduction provided methodological discussion of epigraphic techniques, paleographic principles, and historical interpretation. Hultzsch addressed challenges inherent in South Indian epigraphy: the individual stylistic variations among different scribes working in the same period, regional variations in letter forms within the Tamil and Grantha scripts, the evolution of scripts over time, and the difficulties of reading weathered or damaged inscriptions. His scholarly apparatus included critical notes on alternative readings, discussions of problematic passages, and comparative references to related inscriptions, establishing a standard of philological rigor for subsequent volumes.

## Historical Significance

Volume I of *South Indian Inscriptions* established the empirical foundation for modern historical understanding of early medieval South India, transforming the Pallava dynasty from a shadowy presence known primarily through later literary sources into a well-documented polity with detailed chronological, administrative, and cultural records. The dozen or so copper-plate grants in Sanskrit, all dated in regnal years, provided the chronological skeleton for Pallava dynastic history, while stone inscriptions filled in details of administrative practices, religious patronage, and social organization. This epigraphic evidence allowed historians to establish firm dates for Pallava rulers, identify their territorial extent, document their administrative innovations, and understand their role in the development of South Indian temple culture and Dravidian architecture.

The inscriptions documented in Volume I revealed the Pallava period as formative for South Indian civilization. The land grant records showed the creation of brahmadeya villages, an administrative innovation that became standard practice throughout medieval South India. These grants established patterns of agricultural settlement, taxation, and local governance that persisted through subsequent Chola, Pandya, and Vijayanagara periods. The temple inscriptions documented the emergence of temples as administrative and economic hubs managing land, organizing festivals, supporting artisans, and providing education—functions that expanded dramatically in the 8th-12th centuries but originated in the Pallava period documented in this volume.

The multilingual nature of Pallava inscriptions—employing Sanskrit, Tamil, and both Grantha and Tamil scripts—documented the development of South India's distinctive cultural synthesis. The Pallavas' patronage of both Sanskritic Brahmanical traditions and Tamil devotional movements (early bhakti poetry contemporary with these inscriptions) created the cultural matrix within which South Indian civilization flourished. Volume I provided primary evidence for this cultural formation, showing how royal inscriptions negotiated between Sanskrit cosmopolitan prestige and Tamil regional identity, how temple complexes served as sites where Brahmanical rituals, Shaiva and Vaishnava devotionalism, and royal political authority intersected, and how architectural patronage expressed both religious devotion and political legitimacy.

Beyond Pallava studies, Volume I established methodological principles for South Indian epigraphy as a historical discipline. Hultzsch demonstrated that systematic collection, accurate transcription, paleographic analysis, and careful philological interpretation could extract reliable historical data from inscriptional sources. His work showed that inscriptions provided information unavailable from literary sources: precise dates, economic data (land measurements, tax rates, commodity prices), administrative terminology, social structures (castes, occupational groups, community organizations), and local geographical information (village names, irrigation systems, land classifications). The approximately 3,500 Tamil Chola-period inscriptions published in subsequent volumes, roughly half dealing with agrarian arrangements, built on the foundation Hultzsch established in Volume I.

The series' documentation of approximately 60,000 inscriptions from Tamil Nadu alone transformed South Indian history from a field dependent on legendary materials and later literary sources into a discipline grounded in contemporary primary evidence. For the Chola period, roughly 19,000 epigraphic records allowed researchers to detail landholding-linked transfers to temples, reconstruct trade networks, document taxation systems, and understand the relationship between royal power and local autonomy. Volume I initiated this transformation, demonstrating epigraphy's capacity to illuminate India's dynastic history, which otherwise lacked extensive contemporary historical chronicles. The methodological standards and publication formats established in this inaugural volume guided Indian epigraphy for over a century, making the South Indian Inscriptions series an indispensable resource for historians of medieval South India and a model for epigraphic documentation worldwide.
