  Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan's "Eastern Religions and Western Thought" (1939), published by Oxford's Clarendon Press based on lectures delivered 1936-1938 during his tenure as Spalding Professor of Eastern Religions and Ethics at Oxford University, represents his most sustained engagement with comparative religious philosophy, arguing that Eastern mystical traditions (particularly Hindu Vedantic philosophy) profoundly influenced Western intellectual history from ancient Greece through Christianity, Neoplatonism, and modern philosophy while advocating renewed East-West dialogue transcending colonial-era civilizational hierarchies and religious exclusivism. This 400-page work, appearing shortly before World War II during period of intensifying cultural nationalism and interreligious tension, synthesizes decades of Radhakrishnan's scholarship on Indian philosophy, his neo-Vedantic interpretive frameworks, and his commitment to demonstrating universal spiritual truths underlying diverse religious traditions—positions reflecting his roles as both academic philosopher mediating between Indian and Western intellectual traditions and cultural diplomat promoting India's philosophical heritage on international stages. The book's core thesis traces Indian philosophical influence on Western thought through multiple historical channels: ancient Greek philosophy's encounters with Indian gymnosophists (ascetics) and possible influence on Pythagoreanism, Platonism, and Neoplatonism; Hellenistic period connections through Alexandria where Jewish, Christian, Indian, and Greek traditions intermingled; Indian Buddhist and Hindu influences on Gnosticism, early Christian mysticism, and Neoplatonic philosophy (particularly Plotinus); medieval transmission through Islamic philosophers who engaged Indian materials; Renaissance and Enlightenment thinkers' encounters with Indian texts through colonial contact; and modern Western philosophy's engagement with Vedantic idealism, particularly German idealists and British neo-Hegelians. Radhakrishnan argues these historical connections demonstrate Indian philosophy's sophistication, rationality, and relevance to universal philosophical concerns while challenging Orientalist narratives positioning Indian thought as pre-rational mysticism inferior to Western philosophical rationalism. The work addresses multiple audiences: Western philosophers and theologians seeking understanding of Eastern religions; Indian intellectuals negotiating between tradition and modernity, colonialism and nationalism; and general readers interested in comparative religion, mysticism, and East-West cultural dialogue. Radhakrishnan's methodology integrates historical reconstruction documenting textual and biographical connections; comparative philosophical analysis examining conceptual convergences between Vedantic, Platonic, and Christian mystical traditions; and constructive philosophy proposing mystical experience's universal validity transcending cultural-religious particularities. Core chapters examine Hindu mysticism's philosophical foundations in Upanishadic non-dualism; Greek philosophy's possible Indian connections including Pythagorean transmigration doctrines, Platonic idealism, and Neoplatonic emanation theories resembling Vedantic cosmology; Christian mysticism's development through Gnostic and Neoplatonic influences potentially mediated by Indian thought; and proposals for contemporary religious dialogue recognizing underlying unity while respecting surface diversity. Radhakrishnan emphasizes several interconnected themes: mystical experience as valid epistemological foundation providing direct intuitive apprehension of ultimate reality beyond conceptual-linguistic mediation; underlying metaphysical unity across religious traditions with diverse cultural expressions representing complementary perspectives on single transcendent truth; Western philosophy's dualistic tendencies (matter-spirit, body-mind, finite-infinite) requiring correction through Vedantic non-dual ontology; and spirituality's compatibility with rationality, science, and modern ethical concerns through proper philosophical interpretation transcending literalist dogmatism. The work's publication at Oxford with prestigious Clarendon Press imprint positioned Radhakrishnan as authoritative interpreter of Eastern religions for Western academic audiences while his Spalding Professorship—first non-European holder of this endowed chair—symbolized Indian intellectual achievements' international recognition. The book's reception reflected complex dynamics: Western scholars appreciated systematic presentation making Indian philosophy accessible while some critiqued oversimplifications and questionable historical claims regarding Indian influence on Greek thought; Indian intellectuals celebrated Radhakrishnan's defense of Indian civilization's philosophical sophistication while some criticized neo-Vedantic biases marginalizing Buddhist, Jain, materialist, and popular religious traditions; and Christian theologians engaged his proposals for interreligious dialogue with mixture of interest and defensiveness regarding Christianity's uniqueness claims. Modern scholarly reassessment acknowledges the work's historical significance while noting interpretive limitations: questionable claims about direct Indian influence on Plato and early Christianity lacking documentary evidence; neo-Vedantic frameworks emphasizing underlying unity potentially obscuring genuine philosophical disagreements; modernizing interpretations reading contemporary concerns anachronistically into classical texts; essentializing "Eastern" and "Western" thought as monolithic traditions ignoring internal diversity; and apologetic tendencies prioritizing demonstrating Indian philosophy's value within Western frameworks rather than examining it on own terms. Recent scholarship in comparative philosophy, postcolonial religious studies, and history of philosophy critiques universalist mysticism theories like Radhakrishnan's, emphasizing how claims about underlying unity often privilege particular traditions (in his case Advaita Vedanta) while marginalizing others, how colonial power relations shaped comparative religious scholarship's frameworks and assumptions, and how appeals to universal spiritual experience sometimes mask cultural-political projects of legitimation and resistance. Despite limitations, the work remains significant for understanding mid-twentieth-century comparative religious thought, neo-Vedantic intellectual strategies, and efforts by colonized intellectuals to assert their traditions' sophistication and relevance against dismissive Orientalist narratives. Radhakrishnan's influence extended beyond academic philosophy to popular spirituality, interfaith dialogue movements, and global interest in "Eastern wisdom" where his presentations continue shaping Western perceptions despite scholarly critiques. The book exemplifies challenges facing philosophers negotiating between particular cultural traditions and universal truth claims, between defending marginalized traditions and critically examining them, and between scholarly rigor and public accessibility in making non-Western philosophies legible to Western audiences shaped by different intellectual frameworks and cultural assumptions.

## Oxford Context and Spalding Professorship

"Eastern Religions and Western Thought" emerged from Radhakrishnan's lectures as Spalding Professor of Eastern Religions and Ethics at Oxford University (1936-1952), a position making him the first non-European holder of this endowed chair established to promote understanding of Asian religions and philosophies. His appointment symbolized Indian intellectual achievements' international recognition while placing him at institutional center of Western academic engagement with Eastern thought during crucial period preceding Indian independence and World War II's disruption of colonial systems.

The Spalding Professorship required public lectures accessible to general Oxford audiences alongside scholarly research, shaping the book's combination of academic rigor and readable exposition for educated non-specialists. Radhakrishnan used this platform to challenge prevailing Orientalist narratives dismissing Indian philosophy as pre-rational mysticism while demonstrating its historical influence on Western intellectual traditions—arguments serving both scholarly and political purposes during period when Indian nationalism contested colonial claims about indigenous civilization's inferiority requiring British tutelage.

The 1939 publication timing, shortly before World War II, situated the work within intensifying debates over civilizational values, religious tolerance, and possibilities for East-West dialogue amid rising nationalisms and interreligious tensions. Radhakrishnan's advocacy for recognizing underlying spiritual unity transcending sectarian divisions addressed both Indian contexts (Hindu-Muslim tensions, caste conflicts) and international contexts (Christian-Hindu missionary conflicts, Western-Eastern civilizational confrontations) where religious differences fueled political violence.

## Content and Comparative Methodology

The book traces claimed Indian influences on Western philosophy through ancient Greek contacts with Indian gymnosophists and ascetics; Hellenistic Alexandria's synthesis of Jewish, Christian, Greek, and possibly Indian traditions; Neoplatonism's similarities to Vedantic non-dualism; Christian mysticism's development through Gnostic and Neoplatonic channels; Islamic philosophy's transmission of Indian materials; and modern Western philosophy's engagement with Vedantic idealism. Each chapter combines historical reconstruction, textual analysis, and comparative philosophical examination of conceptual convergences.

Core philosophical arguments emphasize mystical experience's universal validity providing direct intuitive knowledge of ultimate reality; metaphysical non-dualism resolving Western philosophy's problematic dualisms; spirituality's compatibility with rationality and science through proper interpretation; and ethical universalism grounded in recognizing divine presence in all beings. Radhakrishnan positions Hindu Vedantic philosophy as offering resources for addressing modern philosophical problems while demonstrating its historical relevance to Western intellectual development.

The comparative methodology identifies structural similarities between Vedantic and Western mystical traditions (Plotinus, Meister Eckhart, Christian mystics) regarding ultimate reality's ineffability, individual souls' essential unity with divine, and contemplative practices for direct spiritual realization. These parallels serve arguments for underlying truth transcending cultural-religious particularities—claims supporting both scholarly thesis about historical influence and normative proposal for contemporary interfaith dialogue.

## Scholarly Impact and Critical Reception

The work established Radhakrishnan as preeminent interpreter of Indian philosophy for Western audiences, influencing academic comparative religion, popular spirituality movements, and interfaith dialogue initiatives. His arguments for recognizing universal mystical experience underlying diverse religious expressions shaped perennial philosophy traditions, comparative mysticism studies, and pluralist religious theology throughout mid-twentieth century.

Critical reception reflected complex dynamics. Western scholars appreciated systematic presentation but questioned historical claims about Indian influence on Plato and early Christianity lacking documentary support. Indian intellectuals celebrated defense of Indian philosophical sophistication while some critiqued neo-Vedantic biases marginalizing non-Brahmanical traditions. Christian theologians engaged proposals for dialogue with mixture of interest and defensiveness regarding uniqueness claims.

Modern scholarship critically reassesses universalist mysticism theories, emphasizing how claims about underlying unity privilege particular traditions while marginalizing others, how colonial contexts shaped comparative frameworks, and how essentializing "Eastern" and "Western" thought ignores internal diversity. Recent postcolonial and comparative philosophy work examines power relations embedded in cross-cultural interpretation, challenges about representing alien traditions within different conceptual frameworks, and politics of legitimation where colonized intellectuals assert their traditions' value within colonial epistemic systems.

Despite limitations, the work remains significant for understanding mid-twentieth-century comparative religious thought, neo-Vedantic intellectual strategies, and colonized intellectuals' negotiations between defending marginalized traditions and critically examining them, between particular cultural commitments and universal philosophical claims, between scholarly rigor and public accessibility in making non-Western philosophies intelligible to Western audiences.
