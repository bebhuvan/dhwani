# Conference of Orientalists: Simla, July 1911

## Overview

These 174-page proceedings document an international conference of Orientalists, including museum and archaeology professionals, held in Simla (now Shimla) during July 1911. The gathering brought together British and Indian scholars, civil servants, archaeologists, and museum curators to discuss Eastern languages, Indian cultural institutions, archaeological discoveries, and administrative policies affecting scholarship and cultural preservation. The conference reflects the institutional landscape of Oriental studies in colonial India at its administrative zenith, documenting both scholarly achievements and the colonial frameworks shaping knowledge production.

## Historical Context

By 1911, British India had developed substantial infrastructure for Oriental studies: the Archaeological Survey of India (reorganized 1901 under John Marshall), numerous regional museums, university Oriental departments, learned societies, and government support for textual editing and archaeological excavation. Simla, as the summer capital of British India, hosted administrative and intellectual gatherings during hot season months when officials relocated from Calcutta.

The conference occurred during a period of intense archaeological activity, with major excavations at Taxila, Sanchi, and other sites revealing ancient Indian civilizations. Museums were expanding collections and developing conservation techniques. Oriental scholarship was professionalizing, with academic standards replacing earlier amateur orientalism.

## Conference Topics

Proceedings likely covered:
- **Languages and Philology**: Research on Sanskrit, Persian, Arabic, and regional Indian languages
- **Museums and Collections**: Curation practices, conservation techniques, acquisitions
- **Archaeology**: Recent discoveries, excavation methods, site preservation
- **Administrative Matters**: Government support for scholarship, civil service training in languages
- **Cultural Institutions**: Libraries, learned societies, publication initiatives
- **Education**: Oriental studies in universities and schools

The interdisciplinary nature reflected Oriental studies' breadth, encompassing philology, history, archaeology, art history, and anthropology.

## Participants

Attendees included British ICS officers with scholarly interests, professional archaeologists and museum curators, university professors, Indian scholars (pandits and professors), and independent researchers. The mix of officials and academics reflected how colonial administration and scholarship intersected, with many British officials pursuing Oriental research alongside administrative duties.

## Significance

These proceedings document the institutional maturity of Oriental studies in colonial India. They reveal scholarly priorities, methodological debates, and the relationships between government administration and academic research. The conference also shows Indian scholars' participation in institutionalized Oriental studies, though often in subordinate positions to British colleagues.

## Digital Preservation

These 174-page proceedings have been digitized from the University of Toronto library and are freely accessible through the Internet Archive, providing scholars insight into early 20th-century Oriental studies, museum practices, and archaeological work in colonial India.
