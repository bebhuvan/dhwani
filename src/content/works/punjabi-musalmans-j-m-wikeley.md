# Punjabi Musalmans

## Overview
Originally printed in Lahore, *Punjabi Musalmans* profiles the region’s Muslim clans for officials managing recruitment, revenue, and education. Wikeley outlines migration stories, genealogies, and religious affiliations—from Sayyids and Pathans to agricultural tribes such as the Jats and Rajputs—and links each group to its role within the colonial state.

## Highlights
The report collates statistics from settlement reports and regimental muster rolls, recording enlistment patterns during the 1857 uprising and subsequent frontier campaigns. Wikeley discusses pirs, shrines, and Sufi lineages that shaped local authority, while appendices reproduce tables comparing agricultural output, village locations, and martial reputations used in “class” recruitment policies.

## Access Notes
The Internet Archive scan delivers clear text and fold-out tables, making it straightforward to search for particular biradaris or tehsils when studying the Punjab’s socio-religious landscape under British rule.
