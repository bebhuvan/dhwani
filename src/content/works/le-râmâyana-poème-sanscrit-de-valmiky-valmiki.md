description: 'Compiled around 500-400 BCE during the post-Vedic period in ancient
  India, Valmiki''s Râmâyana emerged as a seminal work during a transformative era
  of Sanskrit literary and philosophical development, reflecting the socio-cultural
  transitions of the early classical Indian civilization. Valmiki, traditionally considered
  the first Sanskrit poet and often referred to as the "Adi Kavi" (first poet), composed
  this epic during a time of significant religious and social restructuring, when
  Brahmanical traditions were being codified and complex philosophical and ethical
  frameworks were taking shape. Valmiki''s Râmâyana, one of the world''s greatest
  epics and a foundational text of Indian literature and Hindu religious tradition,
  translated into French from the original Sanskrit. This complete work encompasses
  both volumes (tomes) of the French translation, tracing the entire epic from Rama''s
  divine birth and royal lineage through his exile, Sita''s abduction by the demon
  king Ravana, the formation of alliances with Sugriva and the monkey army, and the
  climactic battle for Sita''s rescue. The epic interweaves mythology, religious instruction,
  and profound literature, exploring dharma (righteous duty), virtue, and the proper
  conduct of life while combining lyrical beauty with philosophical depth.

# Le Râmâyana: Poème sanscrit de Valmiky

## Overview

Valmiki's Râmâyana, one of the world's greatest epics, stands as a foundational text of Indian literature and Hindu religious tradition. This French translation from the original Sanskrit makes this masterpiece accessible to francophone readers, presenting the complete epic narrative across both volumes (tomes).

## Tome Premier: The Divine Origins

The first volume establishes the mythological foundations and genealogical context essential to understanding Rama's extraordinary life and destiny. Opening in the prosperous kingdom of Koçala and the splendid city of Ayodhyâ, ruled by King Daçaratha, the narrative traces the sacred circumstances surrounding Rama's birth as an incarnation of Vishnu. The opening books introduce the royal lineage, divine revelation, and the interplay between human desire and divine will that characterizes the entire epic.

Valmiki's masterful narrative interweaves genealogy, mythology, and human emotion, creating a richly layered account that functions simultaneously as religious instruction and profound literature. The first volume establishes Rama not merely as an exceptionally gifted human but as divine manifestation taking human form, a theological framework essential for understanding subsequent events.

## Tome Second: Alliance and Conflict

The second volume advances the epic narrative toward its climactic confrontation, tracing Rama's alliance with the monkey king Sugriva and the mobilization of forces opposing Ravana's demon kingdom. This portion concentrates on the formation of political and military alliances essential to Rama's quest to rescue his beloved wife Sita from Ravana's captivity.

The volume opens with Lakshmana, Rama's devoted brother, confronting Sugriva about his delayed assistance, establishing the emotional tension driving this section. The narrative then chronicles the gathering of Sugriva's vast monkey army, revealing sophisticated understanding of logistics, strategy, and military organization. Rather than depicting simple hero-versus-villain conflict, Valmiki presents complex relationships, competing loyalties, and the difficult process of creating unity among disparate forces.

## Literary and Spiritual Significance

Valmiki's epic transcends simple narrative through its sophisticated exploration of dharma, virtue, and the proper conduct of life. Characters are portrayed not as simple good or evil but as individuals navigating complex obligations and competing values. The epic suggests that true heroism involves not merely individual courage but the ability to inspire others to extraordinary effort in service of just causes.

The verses combine lyrical beauty with philosophical depth, creating a work that functions as entertainment, religious instruction, and meditation on fundamental human concerns. This French translation extends the epic's reach to readers unable to engage with the original Sanskrit, making accessible one of humanity's great literary and spiritual treasures.
