description: "Jaimini's Mimamsa Sutras constitute the foundational text of Purva Mimamsa, one of six orthodox Hindu philosophical systems, establishing systematic hermeneutics for interpreting Vedic ritual injunctions and their philosophical implications. Composed between 300-200 BCE, this work of approximately 2,700 sutras across twelve chapters (adhyayas) addresses fundamental questions: How do we know Vedic injunctions are valid? What constitutes proper ritual action (dharma)? How do scriptural commands relate to philosophical knowledge? The text develops sophisticated philosophy of language, epistemology of testimony (shabda-pramana), theory of meaning and sentence unity, and metaphysics of action and its unseen results (apurva). Beyond ritual exegesis, Mimamsa contributed crucial philosophical innovations: establishing Vedic texts as self-validating eternal knowledge (apaurusheya), analyzing imperative versus descriptive language, and theorizing how linguistic meaning arises. Ganganath Jha's and Mohan Lal Sandal's English translations made this philosophically dense text accessible to global scholarship on Indian epistemology and philosophy of language."
