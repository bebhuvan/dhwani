# Gold, Sport, and Coffee Planting in Mysore: With chapters on coffee planting in Coorg, the Mysore representative assembly, the Indian congress, caste and the Indian silver question, being the 38 years' experiences of a Mysore planter

## Overview

"Gold, Sport, and Coffee Planting in Mysore" by Robert H. Elliot is a historical account written in the late 19th century. The work chronicles the author's extensive experiences over 38 years as a planter in the Mysore region of India, detailing observations on coffee cultivation, the impact of European settlers, and local socio-economic conditions, particularly during periods of famine.

## Historical Journey

The opening introduces Elliot's journey to Mysore in 1855, describing significant changes in both travel experience and the region since then. He reflects on the pioneering days of coffee planting, the isolation felt by early European settlers, and the transformative effects of British capital and governance on the local economy and infrastructure. Elliot's narrative reveals keen appreciation for Mysore's countryside and commitment to exploring both the challenges and triumphs of agricultural life in the region.

## Broader Context

The work provides valuable insights into not only practical coffee cultivation but also the complexities of cultural interactions and the evolution of Mysore's landscape over time, documenting the profound socio-economic transformations of the era.
