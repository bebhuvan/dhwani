  During the early fifth century CE, the Chinese Buddhist monk Faxian (also known as Fa-hien) embarked on one of the most remarkable journeys in religious history—a fifteen-year pilgrimage from China to India and Ceylon (modern-day Sri Lanka) in search of complete Buddhist texts and monastic codes. His "A Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms," translated into English by the distinguished Victorian sinologist James Legge in 1886, stands as the earliest surviving Chinese account of travel to India and provides an invaluable first-hand witness to Buddhism during the Gupta period (circa 320-550 CE), often regarded as the golden age of classical Indian civilization. Departing from Chang'an (modern Xi'an) in 399 CE at approximately sixty years of age, Faxian traveled overland through the treacherous Taklamakan Desert, crossed the formidable Pamir mountains, and traversed the Indian subcontinent from the northwest frontier kingdoms through the Ganges valley to the Buddhist heartlands of Magadha and beyond. His pilgrimage was motivated by the perceived incompleteness of Buddhist disciplinary texts (Vinaya) available in China; he sought authoritative Sanskrit manuscripts to ensure proper monastic practice. The narrative meticulously documents the geography, political conditions, Buddhist institutions, monastic communities, and religious practices he encountered across Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent. Faxian's observations of stupas, monasteries, festivals, and pilgrimage sites associated with the Buddha's life provide crucial historical evidence for understanding fifth-century Indian Buddhism, corroborating and supplementing archaeological and epigraphic sources. His descriptions of flourishing Buddhist monasticism, royal patronage, elaborate festivals, and peaceful coexistence among diverse religious communities paint a vivid picture of Gupta-era religious culture. James Legge's 1886 translation, published by Oxford's Clarendon Press, made this foundational text accessible to English-speaking scholars, establishing it as an essential primary source for historians of Buddhism, South Asian studies, and Sino-Indian cultural exchange. Legge, first Professor of Chinese at Oxford University and a pioneering translator of Chinese classics, brought rigorous philological expertise to rendering Faxian's classical Chinese into scholarly English, complete with extensive annotations identifying locations, explaining Buddhist terminology, and correlating Faxian's account with other historical sources. The work's significance transcends religious history, offering insights into ancient trade routes, political geography, material culture, and cross-cultural transmission during a formative period of Asian civilization.

# A Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms

## Overview

"A Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms" (Chinese: 佛國記, *Foguo Ji*) represents one of the most significant primary sources for understanding early medieval Buddhism and Sino-Indian cultural exchange. Composed by the Chinese Buddhist monk Faxian following his extraordinary fifteen-year pilgrimage (399-414 CE) from China to India and Ceylon, the text provides an eyewitness account of Buddhist religious life, monastic institutions, and sacred geography during the Gupta period, widely considered the classical age of Indian civilization. Unlike the later, more famous account by Xuanzang (seventh century), Faxian's narrative offers a unique window into fifth-century Buddhism at a critical transitional moment when the religion flourished across the Indian subcontinent but had not yet experienced the transformations wrought by the rise of Tantric Buddhism and the eventual decline of Buddhism in its Indian homeland.

James Legge's 1886 English translation, published as part of the Clarendon Press series on Chinese Buddhist texts, made Faxian's account accessible to Western scholars and established the work as foundational reading for students of Buddhist history, Asian religious studies, and ancient travel literature. Legge titled the work "A Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms: Being an Account by the Chinese Monk Fâ-Hien of His Travels in India and Ceylon, A.D. 399-414, in Search of the Buddhist Books of Discipline," clearly signaling both the text's documentary nature and its author's religious motivations.

## Faxian's Pilgrimage Journey

Faxian departed from Chang'an (modern Xi'an), then capital of the Later Qin dynasty, in 399 CE, accompanied by several fellow monks. Already approximately sixty years old, an advanced age for undertaking such hazardous travel, Faxian was driven by profound concern over the incomplete and unreliable Buddhist texts, particularly monastic disciplinary codes (Vinaya), available in China. The journey westward took the pilgrims through Gansu province, across the harsh Gobi Desert, along the northern rim of the Taklamakan Desert through oasis kingdoms including Dunhuang, Khotan, and Kashgar, then over the treacherous Pamir mountains into the Indian subcontinent.

The route Faxian describes corresponds to portions of what would later be known as the Silk Road, the network of trade routes connecting China with Central Asia, India, Persia, and ultimately the Mediterranean world. However, Faxian's interest was not commercial but religious—he sought the sacred sites of Buddhism and the scriptural treasures preserved in Indian monasteries. His account provides valuable geographical and ethnographic information about the Central Asian kingdoms, many of which were Buddhist at this time, documenting their political organization, economic activities, and religious practices.

Upon reaching the northwestern frontiers of the Indian subcontinent (in regions corresponding to modern Afghanistan and Pakistan), Faxian visited kingdoms including Udyana (Swat valley) and Gandhara (Peshawar region), centers of Buddhist art and learning. He then traveled southward and eastward through the Ganges valley, visiting the great cities and pilgrimage sites of Mathura, Kanauj, Kapilavastu (the Buddha's birthplace), Vaishali, Pataliputra (modern Patna, capital of the Mauryan and Gupta empires), Rajagriha, Bodh Gaya (site of the Buddha's enlightenment), Sarnath (where the Buddha delivered his first sermon), and numerous other locations central to Buddhist sacred history.

After approximately six years traveling through northern India, Faxian journeyed to Ceylon (Sri Lanka), where he spent two years studying and collecting Buddhist texts, particularly complete versions of the Vinaya. The return journey took him by sea via Southeast Asia, a voyage fraught with storms and dangers that Faxian vividly describes, eventually reaching the Chinese coast in 412 CE. He arrived back in the Chinese capital around 414 CE, having completed one of the longest and most perilous journeys recorded in premodern history.

## Content and Structure

The "Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms" comprises forty brief chapters organized geographically, tracing Faxian's route from China westward through Central Asia, throughout India, to Ceylon, and back to China. The narrative style is terse and factual, focused on practical information about distances, routes, monastic communities, and sacred sites rather than personal reflection or literary embellishment. This documentary quality makes the text particularly valuable as a historical source.

Faxian systematically records:

**Geographical Information**: Distances between locations, descriptions of terrain and climate, names of kingdoms and their capitals, and routes traveled. These details have enabled modern scholars to reconstruct fifth-century political geography and identify many ancient sites.

**Buddhist Sacred Geography**: Detailed descriptions of stupas, monasteries, caves, and pilgrimage sites associated with events from the Buddha's life and the lives of early Buddhist saints. Faxian notes which sites were marked by Emperor Ashoka (third century BCE) with pillars and stupas, providing evidence for the extent of Ashokan monuments centuries after their construction.

**Monastic Life**: Observations on the size and organization of Buddhist monasteries, the number of monks residing in them, whether they followed Mahayana or Hinayana (Theravada) traditions, and details of monastic discipline and daily routines.

**Religious Practices**: Descriptions of Buddhist festivals, processions, image-worship, offerings, and devotional practices observed among both monastics and lay communities.

**Buddhist Relics and Images**: Accounts of famous relics (such as the Buddha's tooth, alms bowl, and fragments of bone) and celebrated images, including details of materials, artistic style, and miraculous qualities attributed to them.

**Texts and Scriptures**: Information about which Buddhist texts were studied in different regions, what manuscripts Faxian obtained, and the state of Buddhist learning in various centers.

## Historical and Religious Significance

Faxian's account constitutes an invaluable primary source for reconstructing fifth-century Buddhism and Indian history. Archaeological excavations, epigraphic evidence, and numismatic data can be correlated with Faxian's descriptions to create a comprehensive picture of Gupta-era civilization. His observations that Buddhism flourished under royal patronage, that monasteries possessed substantial landholdings and wealth, that elaborate festivals attracted large crowds, and that Buddhist institutions coexisted peacefully with Brahmanism (early Hinduism) and Jainism align with evidence from inscriptions and other sources.

Particularly significant are Faxian's descriptions of Buddhist sites that were later destroyed, abandoned, or substantially altered, preserving information about monuments that no longer survive or exist only as ruins. His account of the great monastery at Pataliputra with 600-700 monks, his description of the magnificent festivals at Khotan involving elaborate processions with decorated elephants and image-cars, and his observations on the different schools of Buddhism practiced in different regions provide details found nowhere else in the historical record.

The text also illuminates the international character of fifth-century Buddhism. Faxian encountered monks from many regions, notes the presence of foreign merchants and pilgrims at Buddhist sites, and describes a cosmopolitan religious culture spanning from Central Asia to Ceylon. This evidence of Buddhist networks across vast distances, facilitated by pilgrimage and the circulation of texts, demonstrates the religion's success as a trans-regional cultural force.

From the Chinese perspective, Faxian's pilgrimage and the texts he brought back had profound impact. The complete Vinaya texts he obtained enabled Chinese Buddhism to establish orthodox monastic discipline, while his eyewitness accounts of Indian Buddhism lent authority and prestige to Buddhist institutions in China. Subsequent Chinese pilgrims, most famously Xuanzang in the seventh century, followed Faxian's precedent of traveling to India to obtain authentic texts and visit sacred sites.

## James Legge's Translation

James Legge (1815-1897) was among the most accomplished nineteenth-century translators of Chinese classics. A Scottish Congregationalist missionary who spent nearly thirty years in Hong Kong (1843-1873) before becoming the first Professor of Chinese at Oxford University (1876-1897), Legge produced authoritative English translations of the Confucian classics, Daoist texts, and Buddhist scriptures. His linguistic expertise, scholarly rigor, and access to Chinese textual traditions through collaboration with Chinese scholars enabled translations that remained standard for generations.

Legge's 1886 translation of Faxian's "Record" was published by Oxford's Clarendon Press as part of efforts to make important Chinese Buddhist texts available to Western scholars. The work appeared with the full title "A Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms: Being an Account by the Chinese Monk Fâ-Hien of His Travels in India and Ceylon (A.D. 399-414), in Search of the Buddhist Books of Discipline, Translated and Annotated with a Corean Recension of the Chinese Text." Legge worked from both Chinese editions and a Korean recension of the text, employing comparative textual methods to establish reliable readings.

The translation includes extensive footnotes providing:
- Identifications of place names with modern locations
- Explanations of Buddhist technical terminology
- Cross-references to other historical sources
- Discussions of textual variants and translation challenges
- Geographical and historical context

Legge's annotations draw on classical Chinese commentaries, the accounts of later Chinese pilgrims (particularly Xuanzang), European geographical scholarship, British colonial surveys of India, and archaeological discoveries. This scholarly apparatus makes the translation valuable not merely as an English rendering but as a comprehensive historical and geographical commentary on Faxian's text.

The translation's prose style reflects Victorian scholarly conventions—clear, dignified, and somewhat formal—prioritizing accuracy over literary grace. Legge translated Buddhist terms using established English equivalents ("Law" for Dharma, "Buddha" rather than transliterations of Chinese forms), explained Chinese administrative terminology, and clarified elliptical constructions to produce readable English while preserving the original's documentary character.

## Digital Access and Contemporary Relevance

Legge's translation has entered the public domain and is widely available through digital repositories. Project Gutenberg offers the complete text in multiple electronic formats, while the Internet Archive provides scanned copies of the original 1886 Oxford edition, preserving the historical typography and scholarly apparatus. These digital versions ensure continued accessibility for scholars, students, and general readers interested in Buddhist history, ancient travel literature, and Sino-Indian cultural exchange.

The text remains relevant for contemporary scholarship in multiple fields:
- **Buddhist Studies**: As primary evidence for Gupta-period Buddhism
- **Indian History**: For information on political geography, social conditions, and religious culture
- **Chinese History**: Documenting early Sino-Indian contact and Chinese Buddhist development
- **Travel Literature**: As an early example of religious pilgrimage narrative
- **Comparative Religion**: Illustrating Buddhist sacred geography and pilgrimage traditions

Modern translations directly from Chinese have supplemented Legge's Victorian rendering, but his translation endures both as a scholarly achievement and as a historical document reflecting nineteenth-century orientalist engagement with Asian religious texts.
