# Bibliotheca Indica, Volume 96

## Overview

Bibliotheca Indica represents a groundbreaking scholarly publication series launched in 1849 by the Asiatic Society of Bengal (founded 1784 by Sir William Jones). The series published original Sanskrit, Pali, Tibetan, Arabic, and Persian texts along with translations, bibliographies, dictionaries, and grammars, making South Asian literature accessible to scholars worldwide. This digitized collection encompasses multiple works (numbers 17-308) from the series spanning 1848-1979, documenting over a century of Orientalist scholarship and textual preservation efforts in India.

## The Asiatic Society of Bengal

Founded in Calcutta by Sir William Jones, the Asiatic Society pioneered systematic study of Asian languages, literature, history, and sciences. The society's journal, *Asiatic Researches*, and its Bibliotheca Indica series established standards for scholarly editing and publication of Asian texts. Members included European scholars and educated Indians, fostering collaborative research and preserving manuscripts that might otherwise have been lost.

## Bibliotheca Indica: Purpose and Scope

The series aimed to:
- Publish critical editions of Sanskrit and other Asian texts
- Provide scholarly apparatus (introductions, notes, indices)
- Make rare manuscript materials accessible to international scholars
- Support philological and historical research on South Asian cultures
- Preserve texts facing deterioration or neglect

Works published included religious texts, classical literature, scientific treatises, historical chronicles, grammatical works, and philosophical texts representing diverse South Asian intellectual traditions.

## 19th-Century Orientalist Scholarship

Bibliotheca Indica exemplifies 19th-century Orientalist scholarship's dual character: genuine scholarly interest in Asian civilizations combined with colonial frameworks shaping knowledge production. European scholars recovered and edited texts while often imposing Western philological methods and interpretive frameworks. Indian scholars (pandits) collaborated in these projects, contributing textual expertise and traditional learning.

The series influenced European academic disciplines including comparative philology, comparative religion, and Indo-European studies, while providing primary sources for research on ancient and medieval South Asian history, philosophy, and literature.

## Digital Preservation

This collection has been digitized and is freely accessible through the Internet Archive, providing contemporary scholars access to this important series documenting South Asian texts and early Orientalist scholarship in India.
