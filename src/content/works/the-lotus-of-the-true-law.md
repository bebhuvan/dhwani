description: "Hendrik Kern's landmark 1884 English translation of the Lotus Sutra from Sanskrit manuscript, making one of Mahayana Buddhism's most influential scriptures accessible to Western scholarship. The sutra's revolutionary teachings—universal potential for Buddhahood, eternal Buddha transcending historical manifestation, skillful means (upaya) doctrine—profoundly shaped East Asian Buddhism including Tiantai, Nichiren, and Pure Land schools. Combines doctrinal exposition with vivid parables and cosmic imagery that influenced Buddhist art and literature throughout East Asia."
