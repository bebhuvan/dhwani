  The Persian Mystics: Jámí by F. Hadland Davis represents a comprehensive English-language introduction to Maulānā Nūr al-Dīn 'Abd al-Raḥmān Jāmī (1414-1492), the last great classical poet of Persian literature and one of the most significant Sufi masters of the Timurid period. Published in 1907 as part of Davis's series on Persian mysticism, this biographical and literary study examines Jami's extraordinary contributions to Persian poetry, Sufi philosophy, and Islamic scholarship during the cultural renaissance centered in Herat under Timurid patronage. The work presents selections from Jami's major compositions including the mystical allegory Salámán and Absál, the metaphysical treatise Lawá'ih (Flashes), the romance Yúsuf and Zulaikha retelling the Quranic story of Joseph and Potiphar's wife, and the ethical compendium Baháristán (The Abode of Spring), each demonstrating Jami's mastery of diverse Persian poetic forms and his sophisticated integration of Sufi doctrine with classical Persian literary conventions. Davis's analysis illuminates how Jami synthesized earlier Persian mystical traditions—particularly drawing on Ibn Arabi's doctrine of waḥdat al-wujūd (Unity of Being) and the poetic heritage of Rumi, Hafiz, and Sa'di—while developing his own distinctive philosophical approach that balanced orthodox Islamic theology with esoteric Sufi interpretation. The study examines Jami's role as both a creative poet and a scholarly systematizer who produced influential commentaries, biographical dictionaries of Sufi saints, and theoretical works that helped codify and preserve the Persian Sufi literary tradition at a crucial historical moment when Persian cultural influence extended from Ottoman Anatolia to Mughal India. This work is particularly significant for understanding Indo-Iranian cultural connections, as Jami enjoyed enormous prestige throughout the Indian subcontinent where his poetry was studied, memorized, and imitated by generations of Indo-Persian poets and Sufi practitioners, and his works became canonical texts in Mughal courtly education and Sufi spiritual training. The transmission of Jami's sophisticated literary and philosophical works to South Asia contributed to the development of distinctive Indo-Persian poetic traditions that synthesized Persian classical forms with Indian cultural sensibilities, while his mystical romances and allegorical narratives influenced vernacular devotional poetry movements across multiple Indian languages. By presenting Jami's life, thought, and literary achievement to English-speaking audiences, Davis's study illuminates the final flowering of classical Persian literary culture and documents the sophisticated intellectual and spiritual traditions that connected Persian and Indian cultural worlds through shared mystical vocabulary, poetic conventions, and philosophical frameworks that continued to shape South Asian literary and religious culture long after Jami's death.

# The Persian Mystics: Jámí

## Overview

"The Persian Mystics: Jámí" by F. Hadland Davis is a comprehensive study of Maulānā Nūr al-Dīn 'Abd al-Raḥmān Jāmī (1414-1492), the last great classical poet of Persian literature and one of the most significant Sufi masters of the Timurid period. Published in 1907, this work examines Jami's extraordinary contributions to Persian poetry, Sufi philosophy, and Islamic scholarship.

## About F. Hadland Davis

**Frederick Hadland Davis** (1882-1956) was a British scholar who specialized in Persian literature and mysticism. His series of studies on Persian mystics provided English-speaking audiences with accessible introductions to the rich tradition of Sufi thought and the masterworks of Persian literary culture.

## About Jami

**Jami** (1414-1492) was the last of the great classical Persian poets, living during the cultural renaissance of Herat under Timurid patronage. He was both a creative genius and a scholarly systematizer who helped codify and preserve the Persian Sufi literary tradition at a crucial historical moment.

## Content and Analysis

The work presents selections from Jami's major compositions including:
- **Salámán and Absál**: A mystical allegory
- **Lawá'ih (Flashes)**: A metaphysical treatise
- **Yúsuf and Zulaikha**: A romance retelling the Quranic story of Joseph
- **Baháristán (The Abode of Spring)**: An ethical compendium

Davis illuminates how Jami synthesized earlier Persian mystical traditions—particularly Ibn Arabi's doctrine of waḥdat al-wujūd (Unity of Being) and the poetic heritage of Rumi, Hafiz, and Sa'di—while developing his own distinctive philosophical approach.

## Indo-Iranian Cultural Connections

This work is particularly significant for understanding how Jami's poetry profoundly influenced the Indian subcontinent. His works became canonical texts in Mughal courtly education and Sufi spiritual training, studied and imitated by generations of Indo-Persian poets. The transmission of Jami's sophisticated literary and philosophical works contributed to distinctive Indo-Persian poetic traditions that synthesized Persian classical forms with Indian cultural sensibilities.

## Significance

Davis's study documents the final flowering of classical Persian literary culture and illuminates the sophisticated intellectual and spiritual traditions that connected Persian and Indian cultural worlds through shared mystical vocabulary, poetic conventions, and philosophical frameworks.

## Legacy

This early English-language study remains valuable for understanding Jami's pivotal role in Persian literary history and the cultural exchange that made Persian Sufi poetry a foundation of South Asian literary and spiritual traditions.
