# A Grammar of the Persian Language

## Overview

Sir William Jones' grammar of Persian, published posthumously in 1804 (first edition 1771), represents one of the foundational works of modern Oriental philology. The 236-page work systematically describes Persian grammatical structure for English-speaking learners, demonstrating the scholarly rigor Jones brought to language study. Though some pages are missing in this digitized scan (113, 114, 119, 120), the work remains significant as an early scientific approach to Persian linguistics by the scholar who would later identify the Indo-European language family relationship.

## About Sir William Jones

Sir William Jones (1746-1794) was a Welsh philologist and scholar whose work transformed understanding of language relationships and Asian cultures. After studying at Oxford, he mastered numerous languages including Latin, Greek, Arabic, Persian, and Sanskrit. Appointed judge to the Supreme Court of Bengal in 1783, he founded the Asiatic Society in Calcutta (1784), pioneering systematic study of Asian languages, literature, history, and sciences. His 1786 assertion of kinship among Sanskrit, Latin, and Greek languages laid foundations for Indo-European comparative linguistics.

## Persian in India

Persian served as the language of administration, literature, and elite culture in Mughal India and continued as an official language under early British rule. British administrators, judges, and scholars required Persian knowledge for governance, diplomacy, and accessing Indo-Persian literature and historical chronicles. Jones' grammar facilitated British officials' language learning while contributing to philological understanding of Persian.

## Content and Approach

The grammar systematically presents:
- Persian alphabet and pronunciation
- Grammatical gender, number, and case
- Verb conjugations and tenses
- Syntax and sentence structure
- Morphological patterns
- Examples from Persian literature

Jones combined practical pedagogy with analytical rigor, describing Persian's structure rather than merely providing vocabulary lists or phrase books. His approach reflected Enlightenment linguistic methods applying systematic analysis to non-European languages.

## Historical Significance

Jones' Persian grammar exemplifies his broader scholarly project: treating Asian languages with the same intellectual seriousness as classical European languages. His work challenged European prejudices viewing non-European cultures as intellectually inferior, demonstrating the sophistication of Persian literature and linguistic structures. The grammar influenced subsequent Persian instruction and contributed to emerging comparative philology.

Jones' later work on Sanskrit, building on methods developed in his Persian studies, revolutionized understanding of language relationships and historical linguistics. His recognition of systematic correspondences among languages established methodological foundations for comparative-historical linguistics.

## Legacy

Jones used the pen name "Youns Uksfardi" (یونس اوکسفردی, "Jones of Oxford") in his Persian works, demonstrating his integration into Indo-Persian scholarly traditions. His translations of Persian and Sanskrit literature, alongside linguistic works, shaped European orientalism for generations. While later scholars refined his analyses, Jones' systematic approach and respect for Asian intellectual traditions established enduring methodological principles.

## Digital Preservation

This 236-page posthumous edition has been digitized and is freely accessible through the Internet Archive, providing scholars access to this foundational work of Persian linguistics by one of the most influential figures in the history of philology and Oriental studies.
