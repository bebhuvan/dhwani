# 1. Bhikshu-pratimoksha, 2. Bhikshuna Pratimoksha, 3. Mahabagga, 4. Chullabagga

## Overview

This 1934 publication comprises four essential Vinaya texts from the Buddhist Pali canon: Bhikshu Pratimoksha (monastic code for monks), Bhikshuna Pratimoksha (monastic code for nuns), Mahabagga (major division containing ordination procedures and seasonal observances), and Chullabagga (minor division covering disciplinary procedures). Translated into Hindi by Rahul Sankrityayan, the work made these foundational Buddhist monastic regulations accessible to Hindi readers during the modern Buddhist revival in India.

## About Rahul Sankrityayan

Rahul Sankrityayan (1893-1963), born Kedarnath Pandey in Azamgarh district, was a polyglot scholar, Buddhist monk, and pioneering Hindi travel writer who transformed Indian Buddhist studies through his recovery of ancient manuscripts from Tibet. Awarded the honorific "mahapandit" during his lifetime, he knew approximately 30 languages including Sanskrit, Pali, Tibetan, Russian, and Arabic.

After an early engagement with the Arya Samaj and the independence movement, Sankrityayan turned to Buddhism in the 1920s. He studied at Vidyalankara Parivena in Sri Lanka from 1927, where he mastered the Tripitaka and earned the title Tripitakacharya. Ordained as a Buddhist monk in 1930, he took the monastic name Rahul Sankrityayan, by which he became renowned.

Between 1929 and 1938, Sankrityayan made four expeditions to Tibet, bringing back over 360 Sanskrit and Tibetan manuscripts that had been preserved in Tibetan monasteries after fleeing Buddhist monks carried them from Nalanda and Vikramshila universities during the 12th century Muslim invasions. These manuscripts, now housed in Indian institutions, proved invaluable for reconstructing India's Buddhist intellectual heritage.

Known as the "father of Hindi travel literature," Sankrityayan spent forty-five years traveling across Russia, Tibet, China, and Central Asia, documenting his journeys in vivid travelogues. He authored over 100 books spanning Indology, Buddhism, Communism, and philology, along with novels, short stories, and plays. His two-volume "Madhya Asia ka Itihaas" (History of Central Asia) earned him the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1958.

The Government of India awarded him the Padma Bhushan in 1963, months before his death in Darjeeling on April 14, 1963. Modern scholars recognize Sankrityayan as among the most widely traveled and prolific Indian intellectuals of the 20th century, whose work fundamentally reshaped understanding of Buddhist history and Sanskrit literature.

## The Pratimoksha and Vinaya Tradition

The Pratimoksha ("code of liberation") constitutes the core monastic discipline within Buddhist Vinaya literature. Recited fortnightly during posadha ceremonies, the Pratimoksha lists offenses and corresponding penances for ordained monastics. The separate codes for bhikshus (monks) and bhikshunis (nuns) reflect the distinct regulations governing each sangha.

The Mahabagga and Chullabagga, forming the Khandhaka division of the Vinaya Pitaka, provide procedural guidelines for communal monastic life. The Mahabagga covers ordination ceremonies, the rainy-season retreat (vassa), robe-making, and medicine regulations. The Chullabagga addresses disputes, schisms, minor rules, and the organization of communal property.

## Historical Significance

Published during a period when Indian Buddhism was experiencing renewed scholarly and popular interest, Sankrityayan's Hindi translation made these Pali canonical texts accessible beyond specialist circles. The work reflects his broader mission to restore Indian awareness of the country's Buddhist heritage, which had largely disappeared from the subcontinent after the 12th century.

The 1934 publication coincided with the Dalit Buddhist movement's early stirrings and preceded B.R. Ambedkar's mass conversion by two decades. By providing Hindi-speaking audiences access to fundamental Buddhist monastic texts, Sankrityayan contributed to the intellectual foundations for Buddhism's 20th-century Indian revival.
