## Historical Context and Publication

Published in 1894, *A History of Hindu Civilisation During British Rule* emerged during a period of intense intellectual activity among educated Indians responding to colonial governance and social transformation. Pramatha Nath Bose (1855-1934), primarily known as India's pioneering geologist and mining engineer, wrote this historical work during his tenure with the Geological Survey of India. The work reflects late 19th-century efforts by Indian scholars to document and interpret their own society's evolution, countering exclusively European perspectives on Indian civilization. The multi-volume format allowed Bose to examine diverse aspects of Hindu society across several decades of British administration.

## Content and Structure

The work systematically examines institutional and cultural changes in Hindu society from the late 18th century through the late 19th century. Bose organizes his analysis around key social domains: the transformation of indigenous education systems and the introduction of Western-style schools and universities; changes in religious institutions and reform movements; modifications to land tenure and agricultural systems; alterations in caste practices and social hierarchies; and shifts in economic organization and traditional industries.

Bose employs statistical data from government census reports, administrative records, and economic surveys to document demographic and material changes. He analyzes educational statistics showing the decline of traditional pathshalas and the rise of English-medium institutions, examines revenue records documenting changes in landholding patterns, and uses census data to track occupational shifts. The text also engages with contemporary reform movements, including the Brahmo Samaj and Arya Samaj, evaluating their impact on religious practice and social customs.

The work includes discussion of intellectual currents, examining the emergence of Indian-language printing, the development of vernacular journalism, and changes in literary production. Bose addresses the tension between traditional Sanskrit learning and modern Western education, documenting the experiences of Indians navigating both systems.

## Significance and Impact

This work represents an important example of indigenous historical writing during the colonial period, demonstrating Indian scholars' active engagement with social documentation and historical analysis. Unlike many contemporary British accounts that focused primarily on administrative or political history, Bose's approach emphasized social and cultural dimensions of change, centering Indian institutions and practices as subjects worthy of systematic study.

The text provides valuable documentation of 19th-century social conditions from an Indian perspective, offering insights into how educated Indians interpreted the transformations occurring in their society. Bose's use of empirical data and government records reflects the influence of Western historical methodology while applying these tools to indigenous subject matter.

For historians of colonial India, the work serves as a primary source revealing late 19th-century Indian intellectual perspectives on social change, reform, and tradition. It documents specific institutional transformations that affected millions of Indians during this period.

## Author and Background

Pramatha Nath Bose, educated at Presidency College, Calcutta, became one of India's first professional geologists, serving with the Geological Survey of India and later advising princely states on mining development. His scientific training influenced his approach to social history, emphasizing data collection and empirical observation. Bose's diverse intellectual interests extended beyond geology to economics, history, and social analysis, reflecting the broad scholarly engagement characteristic of many Indian intellectuals of his generation. His position within the colonial administrative structure while maintaining critical perspectives on social issues exemplifies the complex positioning of Indian professionals during this period.
