# An Introduction to the Hindustani Language

## Overview

John Shakespear's 564-page instructional work, published in 1845, provides comprehensive grammatical instruction in Hindustani alongside bilingual vocabulary, short stories, dialogues in both Persian and Nagari scripts, and military terminology. Designed for British military officers and civil servants requiring Hindustani proficiency for service in India, the work reflects early 19th-century approaches to language pedagogy and the practical needs of colonial administration. Shakespear's earlier Hindustani Grammar (1813) had replaced John Gilchrist's work as the standard reference; this introduction provided more accessible instruction for students.

## About John Shakespear

John Shakespear (1774-1858) was Professor of Hindustani at the East India Company's Addiscombe Military Seminary (1809-1829), training officer cadets in Indian languages before their deployment. He also published a Hindustani-English Dictionary (1817). His pedagogical works shaped how generations of British officials learned Hindustani, influencing both language learning methodology and British perceptions of Indian languages and culture.

## Hindustani Language

Hindustani emerged as a lingua franca across northern India, combining elements of Hindi and Urdu while being written in both Devanagari (Nagari) and Persian (Nastaliq) scripts. British administrators adopted Hindustani as the primary language for official communication with Indian populations, making its mastery essential for military and civil service personnel.

The linguistic diversity of India required British officials to learn regional languages, but Hindustani served as a common medium across much of northern and central India, enabling basic administration, military command, and judicial proceedings.

## Pedagogical Approach

Shakespear's introduction provided:
- **Grammar**: Systematic presentation of Hindustani grammatical structures
- **Vocabulary**: Bilingual word lists organized by topic
- **Reading Exercises**: Stories and dialogues in both scripts for practice
- **Military Terminology**: Specialized vocabulary for military commands, equipment, and administration
- **Script Instruction**: Guidance for reading both Persian and Nagari characters

The inclusion of military terminology reflected the work's primary audience: officers requiring language skills for commanding Indian troops and administering military affairs.

## Historical Significance

Shakespear's works represent early British engagement with Indian languages as practical necessities rather than scholarly curiosities. His pedagogical methods influenced language instruction at military and civil service training institutions. The work also documents 19th-century Hindustani vocabulary and usage, providing linguistic historians with evidence of language change over time.

## Digital Preservation

This 564-page work has been digitized and is freely accessible through the Internet Archive, providing scholars of linguistic history, colonial education, and Indo-British relations access to this influential language instruction manual.
