# Modern Religious Movements in India

## Overview

J.N. Farquhar's *Modern Religious Movements in India* (1915) remains the most comprehensive contemporary analysis of Hindu reform and revival movements that emerged during the 19th and early 20th centuries in response to colonial encounter, Western criticism, and Christian missionary challenge. This systematic survey documents how Hinduism transformed itself through internal reform, rationalization of practices, articulation as coherent "world religion," and connection with emerging nationalism—processes that fundamentally shaped modern Hindu identity.

Farquhar examines major reform organizations (Brahmo Samaj, Arya Samaj, Ramakrishna Mission, Theosophical Society), social reform campaigns (against sati, child marriage, caste discrimination), religious revival movements (cow protection, Hindu nationalism), and educational initiatives—showing how these diverse efforts collectively modernized Hindu self-understanding and practice. While written from a Christian missionary perspective that views these movements as stepping stones toward Christianity, Farquhar's scholarship demonstrates remarkable comprehensiveness, fairness in representing reform leaders' views, and detailed documentation of organizations, publications, and ideologies.

The work's value lies in its contemporary documentation—Farquhar observed these movements while they actively developed, interviewed leaders, collected publications, analyzed organizational structures—providing primary source material on processes reshaping Hinduism and contributing to Indian nationalism. Despite colonial frameworks and evolutionary assumptions, the work remains essential for understanding how modern Hinduism emerged from 19th-century reformist crucible.

## About J.N. Farquhar (1861-1929)

John Nicol Farquhar served as YMCA educational missionary in India (1891-1923), working particularly in intellectual and educational spheres rather than popular evangelism. Unlike many missionaries dismissing Hinduism entirely, Farquhar seriously engaged Hindu philosophy and reform movements, learning Sanskrit and studying Hindu texts to understand and constructively engage Indian religious thought.

His approach, called "fulfillment theology," viewed Hinduism as preparatory revelation finding completion in Christianity—patronizing from modern perspective but enabling more sympathetic engagement than outright condemnation. This framework allowed Farquhar to appreciate Hindu reformers' achievements while maintaining Christian superiority assumptions.

Beyond this work, Farquhar produced scholarly studies on Gita, Hindu mysticism, and comparative religion, contributing significantly to Western understanding of Hinduism despite missionary agenda.

## Historical Context

### Colonial Encounter and Religious Challenge

Nineteenth-century India experienced unprecedented religious upheaval:

**British Political Dominance**: Colonial rule challenged traditional authority structures and indigenous institutions.

**Christian Missions**: Aggressive evangelism criticized Hindu "idolatry," caste, sati, child marriage, producing defensive Hindu responses.

**Western Education**: English-educated Indians absorbed Western rationalism, science, and critique of tradition, creating internal pressure for reform.

**Print Culture**: Newspapers, pamphlets, books enabled new forms of religious debate and organization.

**Legal Reforms**: Colonial legislation banning sati (1829), permitting widow remarriage (1856), raising marriage age challenged religious authority over social practices.

### Hindu Responses

Hindu leaders responded through multiple strategies:

**Reform**: Eliminating practices vulnerable to criticism while claiming to return to pure original Hinduism.

**Revival**: Asserting Hinduism's superiority to Christianity through renewed emphasis on Vedantic philosophy, yoga, spiritual achievements.

**Synthesis**: Incorporating Western values (rationalism, social reform) while maintaining Hindu framework.

**Nationalism**: Connecting religious identity with political resistance to colonialism.

## Major Movements Documented

### Brahmo Samaj

Founded by Ram Mohan Roy (1828), reformed by Debendranath Tagore and Keshub Chunder Sen:

**Monotheistic Reform**: Rejected polytheism, image worship, focusing on formless Brahman.

**Scriptural Rationalism**: Emphasized Upanishadic philosophy over ritual and mythology.

**Social Reform**: Opposed sati, promoted women's education, challenged caste.

**Institutional Innovation**: Created modern organizational structures, regular worship services resembling Christian practice.

**Internal Divisions**: Splits between conservative and radical reformers, debates over how far reform should extend.

Farquhar traces Brahmo Samaj evolution through its divisions and declining influence by 1915.

### Arya Samaj

Founded by Swami Dayananda Saraswati (1875):

**Vedic Revivalism**: Claimed Vedas contained all truth, rejecting later Hindu developments as corruptions.

**Iconoclasm**: Opposed image worship, pilgrimage, priestly ritualism.

**Social Reform**: Attacked caste by birth, promoted women's education, supported widow remarriage.

**Militant Assertion**: More aggressive toward Christianity and Islam than Brahmo Samaj's reconciliation.

**Mass Appeal**: Unlike elite Brahmo Samaj, Arya Samaj gained broader support, particularly in Punjab.

**Shuddhi**: Conversion/reconversion programs bringing Muslims and Christians "back" to Hinduism.

Farquhar documents Arya Samaj's educational work, social service, and growing political significance.

### Ramakrishna Movement

Centered on mystic Ramakrishna Paramahamsa (1836-1886) and his disciple Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902):

**Mystical Universalism**: All religions as paths to same truth; Ramakrishna practiced Hindu, Islamic, Christian paths.

**Vedantic Philosophy**: Neo-Vedanta emphasizing Advaita's universal spiritual message.

**Social Service**: Ramakrishna Mission combining monasticism with education, healthcare, disaster relief.

**Global Outreach**: Vivekananda's 1893 Chicago Parliament address proclaimed Hinduism as world religion.

**Nationalist Spirituality**: Connected spiritual rejuvenation with national regeneration.

Farquhar analyzes the movement's transition from Ramakrishna's charismatic mysticism to Vivekananda's organized mission and neo-Vedantic ideology.

### Theosophical Society

Founded by Blavatsky and Olcott (1875), gaining Indian following through Annie Besant:

**Esoteric Synthesis**: Blended Hinduism, Buddhism, Western occultism into elaborate cosmology.

**Ancient Wisdom**: Claimed secret knowledge preserved by Eastern adepts.

**Social Reform**: Besant promoted women's education, labor rights, Home Rule movement.

**Cultural Nationalism**: Celebrated Indian spiritual superiority while supporting social modernization.

Farquhar treats Theosophy somewhat skeptically but documents its significant Indian influence.

### Social Reform Movements

**Women's Education**: Efforts by Pandita Ramabai, Ramabai Ranade, and others.

**Widow Remarriage**: Challenging orthodox prohibition.

**Anti-Caste Reform**: Movements questioning caste validity while maintaining Hindu identity.

**Temple Entry**: Campaigns allowing "untouchables" temple access.

**Age of Consent**: Raising marriage age, restricting child marriage.

### Political-Religious Movements

**Cow Protection**: Mobilizing Hindu sentiment around sacred cow, becoming communal flashpoint.

**Hindu Nationalism**: Movements connecting religious identity with political resistance.

**Extremist Politics**: Religious idiom in anti-colonial agitation.

## Farquhar's Analytical Framework

### Evolutionary Perspective

Farquhar employs evolutionary framework viewing religious development as progression from primitive to advanced:

**Stage 1**: Original pure Hinduism (Vedic monotheism)
**Stage 2**: Degradation (polytheism, caste, ritual)
**Stage 3**: Reform (return toward monotheism, ethics)
**Stage 4**: (Implicit) Fulfillment in Christianity

This framework, though problematic, structures his sympathetic engagement with reform.

### Classification System

Movements categorized as:

**Defense**: Efforts preserving traditional Hinduism against criticism
**Reform**: Internal transformation addressing vulnerabilities
**Revival**: Asserting Hindu superiority through renewed emphasis on spiritual achievements
**Syncretism**: Incorporating Western or Christian elements

### Assessment Criteria

Farquhar evaluates movements on:
- Theological sophistication (monotheism valued over polytheism)
- Ethical standards (social reform appreciated)
- Rationality (rejection of "superstition")
- Organizational effectiveness
- Educational contributions

##encing and Impact

Despite missionary perspective, Farquhar's work influenced:

**Academic Study**: Provided foundation for scholarly analysis of Hindu reform.

**Hindu Self-Understanding**: Reform leaders engaged Farquhar's analysis, sometimes responding to his critiques.

**Western Perception**: Shaped Western understanding of Hinduism as dynamic, reforming tradition rather than static.

**Nationalist Thought**: Documented religious reform's connection to emerging nationalism.

## Modern Scholarship

Contemporary historians use Farquhar critically:

**Primary Source**: His contemporary documentation of movements, leaders, publications valuable despite interpretive frameworks.

**Colonial Discourse Analysis**: Examining how missionary scholarship constructed "Hinduism" and "reform."

**Nationalist Connections**: His documentation helps trace religion-nationalism linkages.

**Organizational History**: Details on reform organizations' structures, publications, activities.

**Contemporary Documentation**: Observed movements while active.

**Detailed Information**: Specific data on organizations, leaders, publications.

**Relatively Fair**: Despite bias, Farquhar represents reformers' views accurately.

### Limitations

**Christian Supremacy**: Assumes Christianity's superiority and reform as preparation for conversion.

**Evolutionary Framework**: Problematic hierarchical categorization of religions.

**Elite Focus**: Emphasizes educated reform movements over popular religious life.

**Colonial Perspective**: Views reform through Western frameworks rather than indigenous logic.
