  During the late 19th century, when colonial archaeological research was systematically documenting South Indian historical records, *Epigraphia Carnatica, Volume 4* emerged as a critical scholarly compilation that preserved intricate historical documentation from the Hassan district of Karnataka. Edited by B. Lewis Rice for the Mysore Department of Archaeology, the volume represents a pivotal scholarly intervention in understanding medieval Karnataka's complex sociopolitical landscape through meticulously transcribed and translated inscriptions. Rice, a British colonial administrator and pioneering epigraphist, compiled lithographed facsimiles, romanised texts, and English translations that captured administrative, religious, and cultural records from the Hoysala and Vijayanagara periods (circa 12th-16th centuries). The work provides unprecedented linguistic and archaeological evidence of medieval administrative practices, land grants, temple endowments, and royal proclamations, offering scholars unprecedented insights into the region's sophisticated bureaucratic and cultural systems. By systematically documenting inscriptions in multiple scripts—Kannada, Sanskrit, and occasionally Tamil—Rice's volume bridges linguistic and historical research methodologies, serving as a crucial archival resource for understanding Karnataka's medieval social structures, economic interactions, and religious institutions. Published during the reign of Krishnaraja Wadiyar III and at the height of colonial-era archival preservation efforts, this scholarly work represents a landmark contribution to Indian historical scholarship, demonstrating the complex interactions between colonial research practices and indigenous historical documentation. Beyond its immediate scholarly value, *Epigraphia Carnatica* exemplifies the sophisticated intellectual and administrative traditions of medieval South Indian kingdoms, challenging contemporary colonial narratives about indigenous governance and cultural complexity.

# Epigraphia Carnatica, Volume 4

## Overview
Issued from the Mysore Government Central Press in 1894, this instalment of *Epigraphia Carnatica* catalogues inscriptions from the Hassan district. Rice supplies lithographic facsimiles, transliterations into Roman script, and English renderings that contextualise dynastic grants, temple dedications, and civic charters spanning several centuries.

## Highlights
The volume documents Hoysalas, Nolambas, and other regional powers, noting paleographic shifts and calendrical formulae that anchor inscriptions in time. Detailed site descriptions and cross-references to Gazetteer entries make the set indispensable for historians tracing settlements, irrigation works, and religious endowments in south-western Karnataka.

## Access Notes
The University of Toronto copy retains plates and fold-outs that reproduce original stone inscriptions. Researchers can download the full PDF or inspect high-resolution page images, which preserve diacritics essential for reading Old Kannada and Sanskrit names.
