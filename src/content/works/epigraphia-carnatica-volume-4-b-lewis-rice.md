# Epigraphia Carnatica, Volume 4

## Overview
Issued from the Mysore Government Central Press in 1894, this instalment of *Epigraphia Carnatica* catalogues inscriptions from the Hassan district. Rice supplies lithographic facsimiles, transliterations into Roman script, and English renderings that contextualise dynastic grants, temple dedications, and civic charters spanning several centuries.

## Highlights
The volume documents Hoysalas, Nolambas, and other regional powers, noting paleographic shifts and calendrical formulae that anchor inscriptions in time. Detailed site descriptions and cross-references to Gazetteer entries make the set indispensable for historians tracing settlements, irrigation works, and religious endowments in south-western Karnataka.

## Access Notes
The University of Toronto copy retains plates and fold-outs that reproduce original stone inscriptions. Researchers can download the full PDF or inspect high-resolution page images, which preserve diacritics essential for reading Old Kannada and Sanskrit names.
