## Historical Context and Publication

Published in 1914 under the Archaeological Survey of India's Calcutta Superintendence series, this work represents early systematic documentation of Buddhist heritage in the Western Himalayas. A. H. Francke, a Moravian missionary and self-taught scholar, conducted fieldwork in Ladakh between 1896 and 1908, learning Tibetan and studying local history while stationed at the Leh mission. The publication emerged from his archaeological surveys commissioned by ASI director John Marshall, who recognized the need to document threatened monuments in these remote border regions. Part 1 focuses on sites in the Indus valley and its tributaries, covering monuments from approximately the 10th to 16th centuries CE.

## Content and Structure

The volume opens with extensive documentation of Shey Palace, approximately 15 kilometers from Leh, including measurements of the building complex and translations of foundation inscriptions. Francke provides detailed analysis of the Alchi monastery complex, considered the work's centerpiece, with chapters devoted to the Dukhang (assembly hall), Sumtsek (three-story temple), and smaller shrines. He describes wall paintings showing Kashmiri artistic influence, including depictions of bodhisattvas, mandalas, and narrative scenes from Buddhist texts. The Sumtsek chapter includes analysis of the famous large-scale bodhisattva figures with elaborate clothing patterns.

Subsequent chapters document rock carvings at Mulbekh, including the large Maitreya Buddha relief, and inscriptions at Khalatse, Lamayuru, and other sites along trade routes. Francke provides Tibetan transcriptions alongside English translations, attempting to date monuments through paleographic analysis and historical references. Photographs and line drawings illustrate architectural features, sculpture styles, and epigraphic details. The work includes appendices with genealogies of Ladakhi royal families reconstructed from inscriptions and oral traditions.

## Significance and Impact

This volume established foundational documentation for studying Western Himalayan Buddhist art at a time when many monuments faced deterioration. Francke's transcriptions of inscriptions provide primary source material for understanding regional history, as several sites have since suffered damage. His observations on artistic connections between Kashmir and Western Tibet influenced later scholarship on the transmission of Buddhist artistic styles. The work remains cited in studies of early medieval Himalayan Buddhism, particularly regarding the Alchi complex, which Francke first brought to scholarly attention.

The documentation reflects early 20th-century archaeological methods, combining empirical observation with interpretive historical analysis, though subsequent scholarship has revised some of Francke's chronological conclusions. His linguistic work on Tibetan dialects, evident in the transcriptions, contributed to broader Tibetan studies.

## Author and Background

August Hermann Francke (1870-1930) arrived in Ladakh as a missionary but devoted much of his work to linguistic and historical research. He compiled a Ladakhi-English dictionary, collected oral traditions published as "A History of Western Tibet" (1907), and studied Tibetan dialects. His archaeological work for ASI spanned 1902-1914, producing two volumes on Ladakhi antiquities. Francke's dual role as missionary and scholar was typical of early Himalayan studies, though his documentation work has proven more enduring than his missionary activities.
