# A Diary Kept by Mrs. R. C. Germon, at Lucknow, Between the Months of May and December, 1857

## Description

Mrs. Maria Germon's personal diary documents the siege of Lucknow during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, capturing the intimate experiences of a military family under extreme duress. Her daily entries reveal the mounting anxiety, community dynamics, and survival strategies of British and European civilians and military personnel. The narrative spans from the initial warning signs through months of siege warfare, providing a first-hand account of civilian suffering.

## Historical Context

The Lucknow siege (1857-1858) was one of the most significant engagements during the Indian Mutiny, with British forces and European civilians enduring a prolonged attack by rebel forces. Mrs. Germon's account uniquely presents the civilian perspective, recording family interactions, military operations, and the psychological impact of prolonged conflict.

## Personal Testament

The diary functions as both historical document and human testimony, detailing ordinary routines transformed by crisis—preparations for attack, concerns for her husband's safety, and relationships forged under siege conditions. Her voice provides direct evidence of how the Rebellion's violence affected the British community in India.
