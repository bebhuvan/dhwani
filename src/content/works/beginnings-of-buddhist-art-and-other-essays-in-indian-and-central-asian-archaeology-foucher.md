# The Beginnings of Buddhist Art and Other Essays in Indian and Central-Asian Archaeology

## Overview

Published in 1917 by P. Geuthner in Paris, this 552-page volume translated by L.A. Thomas and F.W. Thomas compiles nine essays originally appearing in French serial publications between 1908 and 1913. The collection emerged during a formative period of French Indological scholarship, when the École française d'Extrême-Orient (EFEO) established systematic archaeological methodologies for studying Asian civilizations. Foucher's work synthesized field observations from major Buddhist art centers across the subcontinent and Central Asia, examining sculptural evidence from Gandhara in the northwest, Mathura in the central plains, and Amaravati in the Deccan, alongside comparative material from Java.

The volume addresses fundamental questions about Buddhist iconographic development through archaeological analysis of stupas at Barhut and Sanchi, Gandharan relief sculptures, and narrative jataka representations. Foucher's essays interrogate the chronological and geographical distribution of Buddhist artistic motifs, employing epigraphic evidence from Satavahana and Indo-Greek contexts to establish dating frameworks. The work includes fifty plates documenting sculptural fragments, architectural details, and comparative iconographic sequences, providing visual evidence for Foucher's interpretative arguments about stylistic transmission and iconographic innovation.

Beyond cataloguing artistic remains, Foucher advanced theoretical frameworks for understanding how Buddhist communities visualized sacred narratives and developed canonical iconographies. His comparative approach positioned Indian Buddhist art within broader Hellenistic artistic traditions, arguing for substantial Western influence on representational conventions that emerged during the first centuries CE. This interpretive stance generated immediate scholarly controversy while establishing parameters for subsequent debates about indigenous versus foreign contributions to Buddhist visual culture.

## About the Author — Alfred Foucher

Alfred Charles Auguste Foucher (1865-1952) occupied a central position in early twentieth-century Buddhist art history, earning recognition as the "father of Gandhara studies" for his systematic investigation of Greco-Buddhist sculptural traditions. His initial 1895 expedition to northeastern India inaugurated four decades of fieldwork across the subcontinent, Afghanistan, and Central Asia. In 1922, the French and Afghan governments commissioned Foucher to establish the Délégation Archéologique Française en Afghanistan (DAFA), which conducted excavations at Hadda, Bamiyan, and other sites crucial to understanding Buddhist artistic diffusion along Silk Road networks.

Foucher's academic training combined classical archaeology with Sanskrit philology, enabling him to correlate textual sources with material remains. His magnum opus, "L'Art Gréco-Bouddhique du Gandhara" (published in two volumes, 1905 and 1918-1951), originated as his doctoral thesis and established the terminology "art du Gandhara," despite initial collegial resistance to the designation. As a senior figure at EFEO, Foucher mentored subsequent generations of scholars while developing methodological approaches that privileged stylistic analysis and cross-cultural artistic transmission. His work extended beyond strictly archaeological concerns to encompass numismatic evidence, architectural reconstruction, and iconographic interpretation, though his 1910 conclusions about Great Zimbabwe's origins were subsequently discredited.

## The Work

The collection's nine essays address discrete archaeological and art-historical problems while advancing Foucher's overarching thesis about Hellenistic contributions to Buddhist iconography. The title essay, originally appearing in "Journal Asiatique" (1911), articulates Foucher's argument that early Buddhist art prior to Hellenistic contact remained principally aniconic, representing the Buddha through symbolic substitutes—empty thrones, Bodhi trees, riderless horses with parasols, footprints, and dharmachakras—rather than anthropomorphic figures. Foucher contended that the absence of Buddha images before the first century BCE reflected cultural convention rather than religious prohibition, asserting that figurative representation emerged only after Greek sculptural models provided formal precedents.

Dedicated essays examine jataka narrative cycles on Barhut balustrade reliefs and the eastern gateway of Sanchi stupa, both dated through epigraphic references to Sunga-period rulers Brahmamitra and Indramitra (second-first centuries BCE). Foucher characterized these labeled bas-reliefs as "documents of the very highest rank" for reconstructing early Buddhist iconographic vocabularies, analyzing how sculptors encoded story identification through compositional formulas and symbolic attributes. His study "Greek Origin of the Image of Buddha" explicitly attributed the development of anthropomorphic Buddha representations to Gandharan workshops operating under Hellenistic aesthetic influence, assigning the earliest free-standing Buddha sculptures to the first century BCE and identifying them as prototypes for subsequent South and Southeast Asian developments.

Additional essays explore comparative iconography ("The Tutelary Pair in Gaul and India"), specific miracle narratives ("The Great Miracle at Sravasti"), animal symbolism ("The Six-Tusked Elephant"), and geographic extensions of Buddhist artistic traditions ("Buddhist Art in Java," "The Buddhist Madonna"). Throughout, Foucher employs stylistic comparison to trace formal transmission while remaining attentive to local adaptations and indigenous iconographic innovations. His analytical framework prioritizes identifying Western sculptural techniques—drapery conventions, contrapposto poses, physiognomic ideals—within Buddhist contexts, constructing evolutionary narratives that positioned Greek artistic influence as catalytic for Buddhist figurative art.

## Significance

**Contemporary Reception:** Foucher's arguments encountered immediate scholarly resistance, particularly from Ananda Coomaraswamy, who published sustained critiques beginning in 1927 challenging the primacy of extra-Indian sources for Buddha imagery. Coomaraswamy and subsequent scholars argued for indigenous Indian origins of anthropomorphic Buddhist representation, rejecting Foucher's characterization of Greek influence as determinative. The polarization between Foucher's Hellenistic thesis and Coomaraswamy's Indianist position dominated Buddhist art-historical discourse for six decades, generating extensive literature on the aniconic-to-iconic transition and the geographic origins of Buddha imagery. Despite contestation, Foucher's systematic documentation of Gandharan material established foundational datasets for comparative analysis.

**Later Assessment:** Mid-twentieth-century discoveries of Roman trading settlements in South India prompted revisions to Foucher's framework, with scholars increasingly attributing Gandharan sculptural characteristics to Roman rather than strictly Greek prototypes. The 1960s-1970s excavation of Ai-Khanoum in Afghanistan provided archaeological confirmation of substantial Hellenistic presence in regions Foucher had identified, partially vindicating his emphasis on Western influence while complicating his chronological schema. John Huntington's 1985 proposal dating Buddha images to shortly after the Buddha's parinirvana (fifth century BCE) represented a radical challenge to Foucher's timeline, though this early dating has not achieved scholarly consensus. Contemporary assessment recognizes Foucher's pioneering systematization of Gandharan material while critiquing his hierarchical privileging of Hellenistic aesthetics and underestimation of indigenous artistic developments at Mathura and other non-Gandharan centers.

**Value for Researchers:** The volume remains essential for Gandhara studies, preserving detailed observations of sculptures subsequently damaged or destroyed, particularly material from Afghanistan and the Northwest Frontier. Foucher's plates document iconographic variants and epigraphic inscriptions that constitute primary evidence for dating and provenance arguments. His comparative iconographic analyses, though methodologically dated, established research questions about symbolic transmission and regional variation that continue to structure scholarly inquiry. Researchers consulting this work engage critically with Foucher's interpretive framework while extracting his empirical documentation of site conditions, sculptural details, and epigraphic data. The text's influence persists through subsequent scholarship either building upon or reacting against its central thesis regarding Classical contributions to Buddhist visual traditions.
