description: "Sharangadeva's Sangita Ratnakara represents medieval India's most comprehensive treatise on music theory, systematizing Hindustani and Carnatic traditions before their divergence while preserving ancient musical knowledge. Composed in 1240 CE at the Yadava court in Devagiri (modern Daulatabad), this monumental work of seven adhyayas covers: svara (notes) and their microtonal variations (shrutis), raga classification and characteristics, tala (rhythmic cycles), musical instruments, dance, dramaturgy, and performance aesthetics. The text documents 264 ragas (including many now extinct), elaborate tala systems, and instrument construction/playing techniques for veena, mridangam, and others. Beyond technical instruction, Sharangadeva presents sophisticated aesthetic philosophy: rasa theory applied to music, performer-audience relationship, and music's spiritual dimensions. The work influenced both Hindustani and Carnatic traditions, serving as authoritative reference for later musicologists while preserving pre-Islamic invasion musical practices. This treatise demonstrates Indian music's theoretical sophistication rivaling any world tradition."
