## Historical Context

Produced during the late British colonial period, this seminal ethnographic survey represents a critical documentation of Indian social structures at the turn of the 20th century, emerging from the 1901 census conducted under British administrative governance. Sir Jervoise Athelstane Baines, a distinguished colonial civil servant and ethnographer who served in the Indian Administrative Service between 1872-1912, compiled this comprehensive work during a transformative era of scholarly engagement with India's complex social landscape. The work provides a meticulously detailed examination of India's diverse caste and tribal communities, capturing a pivotal moment of social documentation when colonial administrative practices intersected with emerging anthropological methodologies. By systematically cataloging social groups, kinship structures, occupational patterns, and cultural practices, Baines's work offers an unprecedented cross-sectional view of Indian social organization, reflecting both colonial administrative imperatives and nascent scholarly interests in understanding indigenous social formations. The ethnography is particularly significant for its granular documentation of regional variations, occupational specializations, and intricate social hierarchies that characterized Indian society during a period of profound social transition. While inherently shaped by colonial perspectives, the work nonetheless provides invaluable ethnographic data that continues to be critically referenced by contemporary scholars of Indian social history, anthropology, and cultural studies. It represents a complex historical document that simultaneously reveals colonial administrative strategies and captures the nuanced social realities of early 20th-century Indian communities, serving as a critical source for understanding the intricate social architectures that defined Indian cultural identity during a period of significant historical transformation.

# Ethnography: Castes and Tribes

## Overview

Sir Jervoise Athelstane Baines' 240-page ethnographic survey, published in 1912 by K.J. Trübner in Strassburg, provides a descriptive analysis of India's castes and tribes based on data from the 1901 Census of India. As Census Commissioner for the 1891 census and a recognized authority on Indian demographics, Baines synthesized census data with ethnographic observations to document the diversity of social communities across the subcontinent. The work exemplifies early 20th-century colonial ethnography's attempts to systematically classify and understand Indian social structures.

## About Sir Jervoise Athelstane Baines

Sir Jervoise Athelstane Baines CSI FRGS (1847-1925) served as Census Commissioner for India's 1891 census and was widely recognized as a brilliant ethnographer and statistician. After a career in Indian civil administration, he brought methodological rigor to demographic and ethnographic studies. Knighted in 1905, his work shaped colonial understanding of Indian social organization and influenced subsequent census operations and ethnographic surveys.

## The 1901 Census

The 1901 Census of India represented the most comprehensive demographic survey yet conducted, collecting data on population, caste, religion, occupation, literacy, and numerous other categories across British India and princely states. The census operation involved thousands of enumerators and generated massive datasets that colonial administrators used for policy formation and resource allocation.

Baines' analysis synthesized census data to identify patterns, document social diversity, and classify communities according to various criteria including occupation, religious practice, endogamy patterns, and social status.

## Content and Approach

The work examines:
- Caste hierarchy and varna system
- Occupational castes and their distributions
- Tribal populations and their characteristics
- Regional variations in social organization
- Religious communities and sectarian groups
- Marriage practices and kinship systems
- Social mobility and status changes

Baines attempted systematic classification while acknowledging the complexity and regional variation of Indian social structures that often defied neat categorization.

## Colonial Ethnography

This work exemplifies colonial ethnography's characteristics: systematic data collection, classificatory ambitions, and the assumption that indigenous societies could be objectively documented and understood through Western social scientific methods. While Baines demonstrated genuine intellectual curiosity and respect for Indian social complexity, his work inevitably reflected colonial perspectives and served administrative purposes.

Modern scholars recognize both the historical value of such ethnographic surveys as documentation of early 20th-century social conditions and their limitations in representing dynamic, contested social realities through rigid colonial categories.

## Digital Preservation

This 240-page work has been digitized and is freely accessible through the Internet Archive, providing scholars of South Asian social history, colonial ethnography, and demographic studies access to this early 20th-century survey based on census data.
