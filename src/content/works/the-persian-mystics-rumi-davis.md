  The Persian Mystics: Jalálu'd-dín Rúmí by F. Hadland Davis represents a pioneering early 20th-century English-language study of the 13th-century Persian Sufi master whose mystical poetry and spiritual teachings profoundly shaped Islamic mysticism across the Persian-speaking world and beyond. Published in 1907 as part of a series introducing major figures of Persian mysticism to Western audiences, this biographical and literary study examines Rumi's life, spiritual development, and extraordinary poetic corpus—including selections from the ecstatic lyrical poetry of the Divani Shamsi Tabriz and the vast didactic narrative of the Masnavi, often described as the "Quran in Persian" for its comprehensive exposition of Sufi philosophy. Davis provides accessible English translations alongside analytical commentary that illuminates Rumi's central themes: the transformative power of divine love, the doctrine of fanā (annihilation of the ego in divine union), the rejection of religious formalism in favor of direct spiritual experience, and the use of dance, music, and poetry as vehicles for mystical ecstasy. The work situates Rumi within the broader tradition of Persian Sufism, examining his relationship with his spiritual teacher Shams-i Tabriz whose mysterious disappearance catalyzed Rumi's poetic outpouring, and analyzing how his teachings synthesized earlier Sufi thought while developing distinctive approaches to mystical pedagogy that would influence centuries of subsequent Islamic spirituality. This study holds particular significance for understanding Indo-Iranian cultural exchange, as Rumi's works achieved enormous popularity throughout the Indian subcontinent, where they were studied in Sufi khanqahs, recited in qawwali performances, and deeply influenced Indo-Persian literary culture from the Delhi Sultanate through the Mughal Empire and into the modern period. Persian Sufi poetry traditions, epitomized by Rumi, profoundly shaped vernacular devotional poetry movements across South Asia, inspiring parallel mystical literary expressions in languages including Urdu, Punjabi, Sindhi, and Bengali that adapted Sufi themes and imagery to local cultural contexts. By introducing Rumi's mystical philosophy and poetic genius to English-speaking audiences, Davis's work contributes to broader understanding of the sophisticated theological and literary traditions that connected Persian and Indian intellectual worlds, demonstrating how mystical poetry served as a universal language transcending ethnic, linguistic, and sectarian boundaries to express the timeless human quest for divine union and spiritual transformation.
