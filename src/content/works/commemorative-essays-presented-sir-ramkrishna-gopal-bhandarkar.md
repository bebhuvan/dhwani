This distinguished collection of scholarly essays represents an international academic tribute to Sir Ramkrishna Gopal Bhandarkar, one of India's most influential Oriental scholars and social reformers. Compiled by his friends, pupils, and admirers from different lands, the volume spans diverse fields including Indo-Iranian philology, Indian history, Sanskrit literature, and Buddhist studies, reflecting the remarkable breadth of Bhandarkar's scholarly influence and mentorship.

## About the Authors

**Sir Ramkrishna Gopal Bhandarkar** (1837-1925) was a pioneering Oriental scholar, educator, and social reformer whose work fundamentally shaped modern understanding of Indian history, philosophy, and literature. As Vice Chancellor of Bombay University and member of the Imperial Legislative Council, he combined academic excellence with educational leadership. His groundbreaking research reconstructed the political history of the Satavahanas and advanced the study of Vaishnavism and religious sects in India.

The **various contributing scholars** represent an international community of academics who recognized Bhandarkar's profound influence on Oriental studies. Their essays demonstrate the global respect he earned through his participation in international conferences and his pioneering scholarship that bridged Indian and Western academic traditions.

## Significance

This commemorative volume reflects Bhandarkar's dual legacy as both a scholar and social reformer who used academic excellence to advance progressive causes. His work in Sanskrit scholarship, Indo-Iranian philology, and Indian history established new standards for rigorous research while his advocacy for women's education, widow remarriage, and opposition to the caste system demonstrated how scholarship could serve social transformation.

The international nature of this tribute illustrates how Bhandarkar's influence extended far beyond India, helping establish Indian scholarship's place in global academic discourse during a crucial period of cultural renaissance and independence movement.
