# Algebra, with Arithmetic and Mensuration, from the Sanscrit of Brahmegupta and Bháscara

## Overview

Henry Thomas Colebrooke's 1817 translation of mathematical treatises by Brahmagupta and Bhaskara II represents a landmark in the Western discovery of Indian mathematical achievements. Published when Sanskrit mathematics remained largely unknown in Europe, this work introduced European scholars to sophisticated algebraic methods and computational techniques that had been developed in India centuries before similar discoveries in the West.

## The Mathematicians

### Brahmagupta (c. 598 - c. 668 CE)

Brahmagupta composed the Brahmasphutasiddhanta ("The Opening of the Universe") in 628 CE, a foundational work covering both astronomy and mathematics. His mathematical contributions include:

- Rules for arithmetic operations with zero and negative numbers
- The famous Brahmagupta formula for the area of cyclic quadrilaterals
- Methods for solving quadratic equations
- Techniques for finding integer solutions to indeterminate equations (Pell's equation)

### Bhaskara II (b. 1114 - c. 1185 CE)

Known as Bhaskaracharya ("Bhaskara the Teacher"), he composed several influential mathematical works:

**Lilavati** ("The Beautiful"): A comprehensive treatise on arithmetic and geometry, covering:
- Arithmetic operations and fractions
- Rules of three and proportions
- Geometric progressions
- Plane and solid geometry
- Permutations and combinations

**Bijaganita** ("Seed Counting" or Algebra): Advanced algebra including:
- Equations with multiple unknowns
- Quadratic and higher-order equations
- The chakravala method for solving Pell's equation
- Surds and irrational numbers

## The Translator: Henry Thomas Colebrooke

Henry Thomas Colebrooke (1765-1837) was a pioneering British Orientalist and Sanskrit scholar who served in the East India Company. His work on Indian mathematics came relatively late in his career but proved immensely influential.

Colebrooke spent years studying Sanskrit mathematical manuscripts, comparing different versions, and working to understand technical terminology. His translation made Indian mathematical works accessible to European mathematicians and historians of science for the first time.

## Content and Significance

The volume presents:

### From Bhaskara's Lilavati:
- Systematic treatment of arithmetic operations
- Methods for calculating square and cube roots
- Problems involving mixtures, partnerships, and interest
- Geometric mensuration of areas and volumes
- Shadow problems (early trigonometry)

### From Bhaskara's Bijaganita:
- Theory of positive and negative quantities
- Algebraic equations and their solutions
- Operations with surds (irrational numbers)
- The "pulverizer" method for indeterminate equations
- Combinations and permutations

### From Brahmagupta's Brahmasphutasiddhanta:
- Rules for arithmetic with zero
- Operations with negative numbers
- Geometry of triangles and quadrilaterals
- Astronomical calculations involving algebra

## Mathematical Innovations

The Indian mathematicians presented in this work made several contributions that were novel to European mathematics:

**Zero as a Number:** While zero as a placeholder appeared in various cultures, Indian mathematicians treated zero as a full-fledged number with defined operations.

**Negative Numbers:** Systematic rules for operations with negative quantities, conceptualized as debts.

**Indeterminate Equations:** The chakravala method for solving Pell's equation was more efficient than methods later discovered in Europe.

**Syncopated Notation:** While not fully symbolic like modern algebra, Indian mathematical writing used abbreviations and conventions that moved beyond purely rhetorical mathematics.

## Historical Impact

Colebrooke's translation had far-reaching effects:

**Recognition of Indian Mathematics:** Demonstrated that sophisticated mathematical development had occurred outside the Greco-Roman-Islamic-European tradition.

**Historical Revaluation:** Prompted historians to reconsider the transmission of mathematical knowledge from India to the Islamic world and Europe.

**Nationalist Significance:** In India, the work contributed to 19th-century nationalist pride in indigenous intellectual achievements.

**Scholarly Foundation:** Established a basis for subsequent study of Sanskrit mathematical and astronomical texts.

## Publication Context

Published by John Murray in London in 1817, the work appeared during a period of growing British interest in Sanskrit literature and Indian civilization. The translation formed part of a broader Orientalist project to document Indian intellectual traditions, though Colebrooke's mathematical focus was more specialized than the literary and philosophical works that dominated Sanskrit studies.

## Mathematical Examples

The text includes numerous worked problems that reveal the practical orientation of Indian mathematics:

- Calculating the height of a pillar from its shadow
- Dividing inheritance fairly among heirs with different claims
- Finding the diagonal of a rectangle given area and perimeter
- Determining interest on loans under various conditions

These problems show mathematics embedded in commercial, astronomical, and administrative contexts.

## Legacy

Colebrooke's translation remained the primary English-language source for Lilavati and Bijaganita throughout the 19th century. While subsequent scholarship has refined understanding of Indian mathematical development and provided more literal translations, this work's historical importance endures as the text that first revealed the sophistication of medieval Indian mathematics to the Western world.

## How to Access

Available through Internet Archive as a digitized scan from the University of Toronto library collection. Public domain, freely accessible for research and education. The work remains valuable both for understanding Indian mathematical traditions and as a historical document in the transmission of mathematical knowledge across cultures.
