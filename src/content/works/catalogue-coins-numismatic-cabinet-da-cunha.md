# Catalogue of the Coins in the Numismatic Cabinet, Parts I-IV

## Overview

This comprehensive four-part catalogue compiled by J. Gerson Da Cunha and published in 1888 documents an extensive collection of Indian coins housed in a numismatic cabinet. The work represents 19th-century efforts to systematically study and catalog India's rich numismatic heritage, providing detailed technical descriptions and historical context for coins spanning multiple dynasties, regions, and periods.

## Historical Context

The late 19th century saw growing scholarly interest in Indian numismatics as a source for reconstructing history, chronology, and economic systems. Coins provided concrete evidence for dating dynasties, mapping trade routes, and understanding political relationships—especially for periods lacking extensive textual sources. J. Gerson Da Cunha was among the scholars contributing to systematic numismatic documentation, creating reference works essential for subsequent research.

## Content

**Scope**: Multi-volume catalogue covering extensive coin collection representing various periods of Indian history, from ancient punch-marked coins through medieval Islamic and regional coinages.

**Technical Documentation**: For each coin or coin type, provides:
- Physical description (size, weight, metal composition)
- Obverse and reverse designs and inscriptions
- Script and language of inscriptions
- Iconographic elements and their interpretation
- Attribution to dynasty, ruler, or period
- Comparative references to similar coins
- Historical and archaeological context

**Organization**: Systematically arranged by dynasty, region, or chronological period to facilitate research and comparison.

**Research Value**: Essential for:
- Chronological reconstruction and dating of dynasties
- Understanding monetary systems and economic history
- Tracing political relationships and territorial extent
- Studying religious iconography and royal titulature
- Analyzing trade patterns and cultural exchanges
- Paleographic study of scripts on coins

## Significance

**Historical Reconstruction**: Coins often provide the primary evidence for existence of rulers, extent of kingdoms, and chronological sequences, especially for periods with limited textual sources.

**Economic History**: Documents evolution of Indian monetary systems, standards of coinage, metal usage, and economic organization across different periods and regions.

**Art Historical**: Preserves documentation of numismatic art, iconography, and aesthetic traditions, reflecting religious beliefs, political ideologies, and artistic conventions.

**Methodological**: Represents development of scientific numismatic methodology in 19th-century Indian archaeology and historiography.

The catalogue remains a valuable reference for researchers, enabling identification of coins, comparative study, and access to 19th-century numismatic scholarship.
