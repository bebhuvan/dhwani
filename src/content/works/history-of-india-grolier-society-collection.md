# History of India (Grolier Society Edition)

## Overview
Issued around 1906 for the New York–based Grolier Society, this multi-volume series commissions prominent scholars to present a sweeping history of the subcontinent. From R. C. Dutt’s survey of Vedic and Mauryan eras to Vincent Arthur Smith’s analysis of classical empires and Sir Alfred Lyall’s account of British consolidation, the set reflects early twentieth-century historiography aimed at general readers.

## Highlights
Each volume combines narrative chapters with translated primary sources, portraits, and maps. Contributions by Stanley Lane-Poole recount Delhi Sultanate and Mughal politics, Henry Miers Elliot reproduces Persian chronicles, and William Wilson Hunter examines European rivalries before Company rule. Photogravures and engraved plates illustrate archaeological discoveries, royal courts, and landscapes.

## Access Notes
The Internet Archive digitisation offers high-resolution scans of the deluxe edition, including fold-out maps and tissue-guarded plates, making it a valuable resource for tracing how imperial-era historians framed India’s past.
