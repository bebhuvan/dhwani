description: |
  The History of India (Grolier Society Edition) represents a pivotal scholarly compilation of early 20th-century historiographical perspectives on the Indian subcontinent, synthesizing the intellectual contributions of prominent colonial and indigenous historians during a critical period of historical interpretation. Published in 1906 at the zenith of British colonial scholarship, the work integrates detailed historical analysis by leading intellectuals like Romesh Chunder Dutt, Vincent Arthur Smith, and Sir Alfred Comyn Lyall, who collectively mapped India's complex political and cultural transformations from ancient civilizations through the early modern colonial period. The volume critically examines India's historical trajectory through multiple scholarly lenses, balancing empirical colonial documentation with emerging indigenous historical methodologies. Significantly, the work captures a nuanced moment of intellectual exchange where Indian scholars were simultaneously collaborating with and critically challenging British historiographical narratives, reflecting the sophisticated scholarly dialogues of the late colonial era. The compilation provides comprehensive coverage of political developments, cultural transformations, dynastic successions, and socio-economic structures across diverse historical epochs, from Vedic civilizations through Mughal imperial systems to early 20th-century colonial administrations. Its methodology represents an important transitional scholarship that bridged indigenous historical understanding with systematized colonial research techniques, offering unprecedented depth in documenting India's multifaceted historical experiences. The work's significance extends beyond mere historical documentation, serving as a critical intellectual artifact that illuminates the complex scholarly negotiations of knowledge production during a pivotal period of cultural and academic transformation in the Indian subcontinent.

# History of India (Grolier Society Edition)

## Overview
Issued around 1906 for the New York–based Grolier Society, this multi-volume series commissions prominent scholars to present a sweeping history of the subcontinent. From R. C. Dutt’s survey of Vedic and Mauryan eras to Vincent Arthur Smith’s analysis of classical empires and Sir Alfred Lyall’s account of British consolidation, the set reflects early twentieth-century historiography aimed at general readers.

## Highlights
Each volume combines narrative chapters with translated primary sources, portraits, and maps. Contributions by Stanley Lane-Poole recount Delhi Sultanate and Mughal politics, Henry Miers Elliot reproduces Persian chronicles, and William Wilson Hunter examines European rivalries before Company rule. Photogravures and engraved plates illustrate archaeological discoveries, royal courts, and landscapes.

## Access Notes
The Internet Archive digitisation offers high-resolution scans of the deluxe edition, including fold-out maps and tissue-guarded plates, making it a valuable resource for tracing how imperial-era historians framed India’s past.
