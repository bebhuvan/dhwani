# Rig-Veda Sanhita, Volume I

## Overview

Horace Hayman Wilson's *Rig-Veda Sanhita, Volume I* (1850, 1946 reprint) presents pioneering English translation of Rigveda's opening mandala. Drawing on Sayana's 14th-century Sanskrit commentary, Wilson made foundational Vedic texts accessible to Western scholarship during formative period of comparative philology and religious studies.

## About the Author

Horace Hayman Wilson (1786-1860), British Orientalist, surgeon with East India Company, first Boden Professor of Sanskrit at Oxford (1832-1860). Pioneered English translations of Sanskrit texts including Vishnu Purana, Meghaduta, and Rigveda. Founded Royal Asiatic Society, advanced Sanskrit studies in Britain.

## The Rigveda

Composed c. 1500-1200 BCE in Vedic Sanskrit, Rigveda comprises 1,028 hymns (suktas) in ten books (mandalas) addressed to Vedic deities. First Mandala: 191 hymns primarily to Agni (fire god), Indra (warrior god), other deities. Meters: Gayatri, Trishtubh, Jagati. Composers: Ancient rishi families (Gotamas, Kanvas). Themes: Cosmogony, ritual sacrifice, natural phenomena, divine praise, philosophical speculation.

## Wilson's Translation Method

Based on Sayana's commentary (Rigvedabhashya), reflecting traditional Indian interpretation. Literal approach prioritizing accuracy over literary elegance. Extensive footnotes explaining Vedic concepts, ritual contexts, linguistic features. Reflects 19th-century Orientalist perspectives and limitations.

## Significance

First complete English Rigveda translation, profoundly influenced Indo-European philology (Max MÃ¼ller, comparative linguistics), shaped Western understanding of Hinduism and Vedic religion, provided textual basis for comparative mythology and religion, established Sanskrit studies in British academia, influenced Transcendentalists and Western engagement with Indian philosophy.

## Modern Assessment

Superseded by later translations (Griffith, Jamison-Brereton) incorporating improved linguistic understanding and non-Sayanachara perspectives. However, remains historically significant for transmission of Vedic knowledge westward and development of Indological scholarship.

## How to Access

Available through Internet Archive, public domain, freely accessible. Volume I covers first mandala; complete translation spans multiple volumes.
