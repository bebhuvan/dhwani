The Milindapanha purports to record philosophical dialogues between King Menander I (Pali: Milinda), the Indo-Greek ruler who reigned circa 155-130 BCE, and the Buddhist monk Nagasena. The text dates from approximately 100 BCE to 200 CE, with scholarly consensus indicating composition around the beginning of the Common Era. The work is composite, with additions accumulated over time.

King Menander I governed territories spanning parts of modern Afghanistan, Pakistan, and northwestern India during the Indo-Greek period. According to the text, Milinda embraced Buddhism following his exchanges with Nagasena. The monk Nagasena remains otherwise unattested in historical sources beyond this text, and scholars note the absence of Greek philosophical influence in the dialogues, which instead trace their intellectual lineage to the Upanishads.

The text exists in Pali, though possibly derived from an earlier Sanskrit original. Its canonical status varies across Theravada traditions. Burmese Buddhism includes the Milindapanha in the Khuddaka Nikaya of the Pali Canon. Thai and Sri Lankan Buddhism do not grant it canonical status, despite the surviving text being preserved in Sinhalese script. Nevertheless, influential commentators such as Buddhaghosa accepted its authority implicitly and quoted it frequently.

The Milindapanha addresses core Buddhist doctrines through dialectical inquiry. The text explores anatta (no-self), impermanence (anicca), suffering (dukkha), the Five Aggregates (skandhas), karma, rebirth, and the path to nibbana. The dialogues employ analogical reasoning and logical argumentation to clarify complex philosophical positions.

The chariot metaphor constitutes the text's most renowned philosophical exposition. Nagasena asked Milinda how he arrived, and the king replied by chariot. Nagasena then inquired whether the chariot was the wheels, axles, reins, frame, seat, or draught pole. When Milinda answered negatively to each component, Nagasena declared there was no chariot. The king acknowledged "chariot" designated a conceptual assemblage dependent on constituent parts—a mere name. Nagasena applied this logic to personal identity: "Nagasena" is likewise a designation for something conceptual. When the five skandhas (form, feeling, perception, mental formations, consciousness) are present, we conventionally speak of a being. The simile demonstrates anatta by showing that no permanent essence underlies personal identity; beings are composite processes subject to continuous change.

The text systematically examines impermanence through multiple frameworks. It analyzes the momentary nature of mental and physical phenomena, the conditioned arising (pratityasamutpada) of all compounded things, and the necessity of perceiving impermanence to abandon craving and realize nibbana. The dialogues elucidate the relationship between conventional truth (sammuti-sacca) and ultimate truth (paramattha-sacca).

Thomas William Rhys Davids characterized the Milindapanha as "the greatest work of classical Indian prose" and "undoubtedly the masterpiece of Indian prose." The text has received three major English translations: Rhys Davids' 1890 translation (reprinted by Dover Publications in 1963), Isaline Blew Horner's 1969 translation (reprinted by the Pali Text Society in 1990), and Maria Heim's 2025 translation published in the Murty Classical Library of India.

The Milindapanha influenced Theravada Buddhist philosophy by providing accessible expositions of difficult doctrines. Its dialectical method, combining systematic questioning with analogical reasoning, became a model for philosophical instruction. The text's treatment of anatta, particularly through the chariot metaphor, established a paradigmatic explanation of no-self doctrine that subsequent commentators and teachers repeatedly employed.

The work represents a significant document of Greco-Buddhist cultural exchange, though its philosophical content remains firmly within Indian Buddhist traditions rather than synthesizing Greek and Buddhist thought. The dialogue format reflects both Buddhist pedagogical practices and Hellenistic philosophical conventions, yet the arguments and conclusions derive from Buddhist sources.

Modern scholarship recognizes the text's composite nature and includes anachronisms, indicating layers of composition and redaction. Despite questions regarding historical accuracy, the Milindapanha preserves valuable insights into early Buddhist philosophical discourse and the articulation of Buddhist doctrine in dialogical form during the post-Mauryan period.
