description: |
  Richard Morris's critical Pali edition of the Buddhavaṃsa and Cariyāpiṭaka represents a seminal scholarly intervention in late 19th-century Buddhist textual scholarship during the colonial period of systematic Indological research. Published in 1882 through the Pali Text Society, this work comprises two significant canonical texts from the Khuddaka Nikaya, offering profound insights into Theravada Buddhist cosmological and philosophical traditions. The Buddhavaṃsa meticulously chronicles the lineage of Gautama Buddha, detailing the lives and spiritual achievements of twenty-four predecessor Buddhas, thereby illuminating the complex Buddhist conception of successive enlightened beings across cosmic time. Complementing this, the Cariyāpiṭaka presents thirty-five Jātaka stories that exemplify the ten pāramitās (perfections), providing a comprehensive narrative exploration of the Bodhisattva path of spiritual development. Morris's scholarly edition was crucial in preserving and interpreting these texts during a critical period of emerging Western academic engagement with Buddhist literature, making these traditionally orally transmitted narratives accessible to global scholarly discourse. The work significantly contributes to understanding the intricate philosophical and narrative traditions of Indian Buddhist thought, revealing the sophisticated literary and spiritual methodologies of Theravada Buddhist intellectuals. By meticulously translating and annotating these texts, Morris facilitated a deeper cross-cultural comprehension of Buddhist cosmology, ethical philosophy, and narrative traditions, bridging medieval South Asian religious scholarship with emerging comparative religious studies in the late 19th century.

# The Buddhavaṃsa and the Cariyā-piṭaka

## Overview

The Buddhavaṃsa and the Cariyā-piṭaka (1882) presents Richard Morris's critical edition of two canonical texts from the Khuddaka Nikāya of the Pali Canon, transliterated from manuscripts in the University of California collection. The Buddhavaṃsa chronicles the lives of Gautama Buddha and the twenty-four Buddhas who preceded him, establishing the canonical framework for understanding Buddha-nature and the lineage of enlightened beings. The Cariyāpiṭaka recounts thirty-five Jātaka stories (birth tales) illustrating the ten perfections (pāramitās)—generosity, morality, renunciation, wisdom, energy, patience, truthfulness, determination, loving-kindness, and equanimity—practiced by the Bodhisattva across former lives.
