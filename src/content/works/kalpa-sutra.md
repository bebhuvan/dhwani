description: "The Kalpa Sutra is one of the most important texts in Svetambara Jainism, traditionally attributed to Acharya Bhadrabahu (4th century BCE). This sacred text comprises three distinct sections: biographies of the twenty-four Tirthankaras (especially Mahavira and Parshvanatha), the lineage of early Jain teachers, and detailed monastic regulations for the rainy season retreat. Recited annually during the Paryushana festival, it holds both scriptural authority and liturgical centrality in Jain religious life."
