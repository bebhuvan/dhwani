description: '"The Bombay City Police: A Historical Sketch, 1672-1916" by S. M. Edwardes
  is a historical account written in the early 20th century. The book chronicles the
  evolution of the Bombay Police Force over nearly two and a half centuries, detailing
  the changes in its structure, organization, and the societal context within which
  it operated. The author draws upon his own experience as a former Commissioner of
  Police in Bombay, providing readers with an authoritative glimpse into the founding
  and development of policing in the city.  At the start of the work, Edwardes sets
  the stage by outlining the origins of the Bombay Police during the late 17th century,
  notably under Governor Gerald Aungier’s administration. Aungier''s establishment
  of an early militia tasked with crime prevention and civil protection is highlighted,
  as well as the challenges posed by various external threats and internal lawlessness
  that characterized the period. The opening chapters convey a sense of the tumultuous
  environment facing the police, detailing the militia system''s complexities, the
  evolving nature of law enforcement, and the social dynamics at play, ultimately
  framing the police force as a critical element in the historical narrative of Bombay''s
  development.'
