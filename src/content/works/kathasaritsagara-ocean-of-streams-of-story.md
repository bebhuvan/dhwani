# The Kathá Sarit Ságara: Or, Ocean of the Streams of Story

## Overview

The Kathasaritsagara (कथासरित्सागर, literally "Ocean of the Streams of Story") is one of the most magnificent collections of stories in world literature. Composed in the 11th century by the Kashmiri court poet Somadeva Bhaṭṭa, this monumental Sanskrit work contains over 350 tales woven into an intricate narrative framework. C. H. Tawney's pioneering English translation (1880-1884) made this treasure trove of Indian storytelling accessible to the Western world, revealing a sophisticated literary masterpiece that preserves ancient Indian folk traditions, mythology, and cultural wisdom spanning centuries of oral and written narrative tradition.

## About the Author and Translator

### Somadeva Bhaṭṭa (11th century)
**Somadeva Bhaṭṭa** was a Kashmiri Brahmin poet who served at the court of King Ananta of Kashmir (1028-1063 CE) and later under Queen Sūryamatī. Writing during Kashmir's golden age of Sanskrit literature, Somadeva was commissioned to create an entertaining work for the queen's amusement. He drew upon the now-lost Bṛhatkathā ("Great Story") by Guṇāḍhya, a much earlier collection in Paisācī Prakrit, and expanded it into the elaborate Sanskrit masterpiece we know today. Somadeva's genius lay in his ability to weave disparate tales into a coherent narrative structure while preserving the oral storytelling traditions of ancient India.

### Charles Henry Tawney (1837-1922)
**C. H. Tawney** was a distinguished British orientalist and Sanskrit scholar who spent much of his career as a judge in British India. His deep knowledge of Sanskrit literature and Indian culture, combined with his literary sensibility, made him ideally suited to translate this complex work. Tawney's translation, completed over several years, remains the standard English version, praised for its readability while maintaining fidelity to the original's style and meaning. His extensive notes and commentary provide invaluable cultural and historical context for Western readers.
