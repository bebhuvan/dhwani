# Gandhi and Anarchy

## Overview
Written after the 1921 Moplah uprising and the suspension of Gandhi’s civil disobedience campaign, Nair’s essays analyse the constitutional limits of satyagraha. A senior moderate nationalist and jurist, he reviews Congress resolutions, government ordinances, and communal tensions to caution against strategies he believed endangered the rule of law.

## Highlights
Nair dissects Gandhi’s speeches, examines the Khilafat alliance, and documents how volunteer corps and boycott tactics affected schools, courts, and revenue offices. He proposes alternative reforms grounded in legislative representation and safeguards for minorities, offering insight into debates that split the Indian National Congress.

## Access Notes
The Internet Archive copy is text-searchable and includes appendices reproducing official correspondence and statistical tables cited in Nair’s argument.
