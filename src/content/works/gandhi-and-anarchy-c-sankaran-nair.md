description: |
  In the critical period of India's nationalist struggle against British colonial rule, C. Sankaran Nair's "Gandhi and Anarchy" represents a significant intellectual intervention challenging Mahatma Gandhi's non-violent resistance strategies. Published in 1922, the work emerges from a pivotal moment in the Non-Cooperation Movement, offering a nuanced critique of Gandhi's political methodologies from the perspective of an insider to colonial administrative structures. Nair, a distinguished Kerala-born lawyer and former member of the Viceroy's Council (1915-1920), brought considerable administrative experience and legal expertise to his analysis of nationalist politics. The text systematically examines the potential sociopolitical consequences of Gandhi's civil disobedience campaign, arguing that unstructured agitation could precipitate communal tensions, administrative paralysis, and potentially destabilize India's fragile social fabric. Drawing on his extensive administrative background, Nair contends that constitutional safeguards and structured political negotiation were more viable pathways to independence than mass mobilization without clear institutional frameworks. The work is particularly significant in Indian intellectual history as an early, sophisticated critique of Gandhian strategies from within the nationalist movement, demonstrating the intellectual diversity and complex debates characterizing India's independence struggle. By challenging prevailing narratives of unified resistance, Nair's text illuminates the sophisticated political discourse emerging during a transformative period of Indian nationalism, revealing the nuanced intellectual negotiations underlying the country's decolonization process and highlighting the multifaceted intellectual traditions that shaped modern Indian political thought.

# Gandhi and Anarchy

## Overview
Written after the 1921 Moplah uprising and the suspension of Gandhi’s civil disobedience campaign, Nair’s essays analyse the constitutional limits of satyagraha. A senior moderate nationalist and jurist, he reviews Congress resolutions, government ordinances, and communal tensions to caution against strategies he believed endangered the rule of law.

## Highlights
Nair dissects Gandhi’s speeches, examines the Khilafat alliance, and documents how volunteer corps and boycott tactics affected schools, courts, and revenue offices. He proposes alternative reforms grounded in legislative representation and safeguards for minorities, offering insight into debates that split the Indian National Congress.
