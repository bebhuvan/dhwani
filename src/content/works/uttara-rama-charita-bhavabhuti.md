description: "Bhavabhuti's Uttara Rama Charita stands as Sanskrit drama's most emotionally profound work, a seven-act play continuing the Ramayana narrative beyond Valmiki's account to explore Rama's agonizing choice between kingly duty (rajadharma) and conjugal devotion when forced to abandon pregnant Sita due to public rumor. Composed in 8th century CE, this nataka revolutionizes the Rama story: rather than triumphant hero, Rama appears torn by ethical dilemmas; Sita transcends patient wife stereotype to embody dignified suffering; and the play's tragic tonality challenges epic conventions. The plot spans Rama's reluctant abandonment of Sita in Valmiki's ashram, their twin sons' upbringing, Lava and Kusha performing the Ramayana before unknowing father Rama, Earth-goddess reclaiming Sita, and Rama's reunion with Sita in the heavenly realm after twelve years. Bhavabhuti's poetic genius appears in heart-wrenching separation scenes, exquisite nature descriptions serving emotional purposes, and karuna rasa (compassion) sustained throughoutâ€”making this perhaps Sanskrit theater's most moving tragedy while technically maintaining happy ending conventions."
