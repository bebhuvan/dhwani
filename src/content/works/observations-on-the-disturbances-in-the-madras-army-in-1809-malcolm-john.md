description: '"Observations on the Disturbances in the Madras Army in 1809" by John
  Malcolm is a historical account written in the early 19th century. The work provides
  a detailed examination of the conflicts and unrest within the Madras Army, reflecting
  on complex political, military, and social dynamics during a tumultuous period in
  British India. Malcolm, a lieutenant colonel in the Honourable East India Company’s
  Madras Army, seeks to clarify his own role and defend his character against perceived
  injustices stemming from government decisions.  The opening of the work establishes
  Malcolm''s intent to address the controversies that followed the unrest among army
  officers. He explains the backstory of discontent that had been brewing within the
  Madras Army, rooted in issues of unequal allowances and perceived favoritism toward
  British officers. It highlights a significant incident involving Major Boles and
  Colonel Capper, whose suspensions sparked widespread indignation and ultimately
  led to a violent uprising. Malcolm meticulously lays out key events, illustrating
  the breakdown of trust and communication between the officers and the government,
  while calling attention to the need for greater understanding and negotiated resolutions
  in military governance.'
