  Ten years after the remarkable success of her pioneering "Jataka Tales" (1912), Ellen C. Babbitt published "More Jataka Tales" in 1922, continuing her mission to introduce American children to the ethical wisdom of Buddhist literature through carefully adapted animal fables and moral stories. This sequel, published again by The Century Company and illustrated by Ellsworth Young, presented an additional selection of tales from the vast corpus of 547 canonical Jatakas—stories of the Buddha's previous lives preserved in Pali Buddhist tradition—retold in clear, engaging prose suitable for young readers. The collection demonstrates Babbitt's continued mastery of cross-cultural adaptation, selecting stories that emphasize universal virtues particularly resonant with early twentieth-century American progressive education ideals: compassion toward all living beings, wisdom in practical affairs, selfless service to others, honesty despite temptation, and the transformative power of kindness. Stories such as "The King's White Elephant" (teaching that true greatness lies in character rather than circumstance), "The Ox Who Envied the Pig" (warning against envying others' apparent fortune without understanding their fate), "The Giant Crab" (illustrating wise problem-solving), and "The Princes and the Water-Sprite" (demonstrating how wisdom and virtue protect from danger) continue the first volume's tradition of using animal characters and memorable narratives to convey profound moral lessons. By 1922, Babbitt's earlier collection had become established in American schools and libraries, creating demand for additional material from the same source tradition. The sequel arrived during the height of the moral education movement in American public schools, when educators sought character-building literature transcending denominational Christianity while maintaining clear ethical content. Buddhist Jataka tales, with their emphasis on observable cause-and-effect moral reasoning and virtues recognized across cultures, provided ideal material for this pedagogical approach. The stories' settings in ancient India, featuring elephants, monkeys, water buffaloes, and other Asian animals, also served geographical and cultural education purposes, expanding American children's awareness of non-Western civilizations during a period of increasing global interconnection following World War I. "More Jataka Tales" extended Babbitt's influence as a pioneering figure in multicultural children's literature, demonstrating that wisdom traditions from distant cultures and ancient times could speak meaningfully to modern American children when skillfully adapted with respect for both source material and young audiences. The work's continued availability over a century after publication—remaining in print through various editions and freely accessible through digital libraries—testifies to the enduring relevance of these ancient Buddhist tales and their effective communication of timeless ethical lessons about compassion, wisdom, honesty, and the virtuous life.

# More Jataka Tales

## Overview

"More Jataka Tales," published in 1922 by The Century Company of New York, represents Ellen C. Babbitt's continuation of her successful project to adapt ancient Buddhist wisdom literature for American children. Building upon the remarkable reception of her 1912 "Jataka Tales," which had become widely adopted in schools, libraries, and homes across the United States, Babbitt selected additional stories from the Pali Buddhist canon's 547 Jatakas—narratives recounting the Buddha's previous lives and the virtues he perfected across countless rebirths. Once again illustrated by Ellsworth Young, whose evocative images of Indian animals, landscapes, and characters enhanced both the literary and educational value, the volume continued introducing young Western readers to Buddhist ethical teachings through engaging animal fables and moral tales.

The sequel appeared at a significant cultural moment. By 1922, the United States had emerged from World War I with expanded global awareness and influence. Progressive education was at its zenith, emphasizing character development, experiential learning, and universal ethical values over sectarian religious instruction. Babbitt's adaptations of Buddhist stories—emphasizing compassion, wisdom, honesty, and selflessness—aligned perfectly with these educational ideals, providing moral instruction that transcended Christian denominationalism while conveying virtues recognized across cultures and traditions.

The work's enduring availability, remaining in print through numerous editions and freely accessible through digital libraries over a century after publication, demonstrates both the timeless appeal of the ancient Jataka stories and Babbitt's skill in adapting them for modern Western children without sacrificing their essential ethical content or cultural authenticity.

## Context: Success of the First Volume

Babbitt's 1912 "Jataka Tales" had achieved remarkable success in American publishing and education. The book's clear prose, engaging narratives, beautiful illustrations, and profound yet accessible moral lessons made it a favorite among teachers, librarians, parents, and children. Reviews praised the work for introducing American children to Asian wisdom traditions, expanding cultural horizons, and providing character education grounded in universal ethics rather than specific religious doctrine.

Elementary schools incorporated the stories into reading curricula, moral instruction, and cultural studies. Public libraries acquired multiple copies to meet demand for both home reading and classroom use. The book's commercial success and educational impact demonstrated that American audiences welcomed carefully adapted Asian religious literature, creating favorable conditions for a sequel.

By 1922, Babbitt had become established as a pioneering voice in multicultural children's literature. Her success with the Jatakas encouraged other authors and publishers to explore world folklore and religious literature as sources for children's moral education, contributing to gradual diversification of American children's literature beyond its predominantly European and Anglo-American focus.

## Selected Stories and Their Lessons

"More Jataka Tales" presents additional narratives, each teaching specific virtues through memorable characters and compelling plots:

### "The King's White Elephant"

This story recounts a magnificent white elephant, treasured by the king, who is captured by enemies and forced into hard labor. The elephant maintains noble bearing and gentle conduct despite changed circumstances, eventually being recognized for his true character and restored to honor. The tale teaches that genuine nobility resides in character rather than external status, that virtue shines through adversity, and that maintaining integrity despite misfortune ultimately brings recognition and reward.

### "The Ox Who Envied the Pig"

A hard-working ox envies a pig who receives abundant food and enjoys apparent ease while the ox labors pulling heavy loads. The ox wishes to trade places, not realizing the pig is being fattened for slaughter. When the pig is killed for a festival feast, the ox understands the wisdom of his own life of useful labor. The story warns against envying others' circumstances without understanding their full situation, teaches gratitude for one's own blessings, and illustrates that apparent hardship may be preferable to apparent ease when long-term consequences are considered.

### "The Giant Crab"

In this tale, an otters' community faces a crisis when a giant crab blocks their access to fish. The clever chief otter devises a plan to make the crab believe the ocean is drying up, causing the crab to flee in fear. The story demonstrates the power of intelligence over brute strength, teaches creative problem-solving, and shows how wit can overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles.

### "The Princes and the Water-Sprite"

Several princes travel through a desert haunted by a water-sprite who devours unwary travelers. The virtuous, wise prince recognizes the sprite's deception and protects himself through mindfulness and knowledge of proper conduct, while less wise travelers fall victim. The tale illustrates that wisdom and virtue provide protection from danger, that knowledge and careful attention prevent harm, and that ethical conduct has practical as well as moral value.

### Additional Stories

The volume includes other memorable tales: "The Measure of Rice" (teaching generosity and trust), "The Quarrel of the Quails" (showing how unity provides strength while division brings vulnerability), "Granny's Blackie" (demonstrating loyalty and the bonds between humans and animals), "The Wise Goat and the Jackal" (illustrating that wisdom prevents falling into traps), and several others, each conveying distinct moral lessons through engaging narratives featuring Indian animals and settings.

## Buddhist Virtues in Accessible Form

As with her first collection, Babbitt skillfully presents core Buddhist ethical principles in forms accessible to children from any cultural or religious background:

**Prajna (Wisdom)**: Stories like "The Ox Who Envied the Pig" and "The Princes and the Water-Sprite" demonstrate that wisdom involves understanding deeper realities beneath surface appearances, thinking ahead to consequences, and making sound judgments based on knowledge rather than emotion.

**Metta (Loving-kindness)**: Tales emphasizing gentle treatment of others, compassion toward all beings, and the transformative power of kindness continue the first volume's emphasis on benevolence as both moral virtue and practical wisdom.

**Sila (Ethical Conduct)**: The stories consistently show that honesty, integrity, self-control, and right conduct lead to positive outcomes while dishonesty and vice bring negative consequences, teaching ethical cause-and-effect in concrete, observable terms.

**Dana (Generosity)**: Several narratives show characters sharing resources, helping others in need, and sacrificing personal advantage for the greater good, teaching selflessness and concern for others' welfare.

**Viriya (Effort)**: Stories featuring hard work, perseverance, and dedication to worthy goals teach the value of sustained effort and refusal to give up despite difficulties.

**Ahimsa (Non-harm)**: The emphasis on kindness to animals and all living beings reflects Buddhism's extension of moral consideration beyond human relationships, teaching children to treat all creatures with compassion.

These values are presented as universal wisdom rather than specifically Buddhist doctrine, making the stories appropriate for diverse audiences while maintaining fidelity to their Buddhist ethical foundations.

## Educational Philosophy and Progressive Era Context

"More Jataka Tales" exemplifies progressive education principles dominant in early 1920s American schooling:

**Character Education**: The stories provide moral instruction focused on developing virtuous character—compassion, honesty, wisdom, self-control—rather than mere rule-following or fear of punishment.

**Universal Ethics**: By drawing from Buddhist rather than Christian sources, the tales offer ethical teaching accessible to children from all religious backgrounds, supporting the public schools' need for inclusive moral education.

**Experiential Learning**: The narrative form allows children to experience moral dilemmas and consequences vicariously through engaging stories, making ethical lessons more memorable and meaningful than abstract preaching.

**Cultural Education**: The Indian settings, animal characters, and cultural details expand children's geographical and cultural awareness, supporting progressive education's emphasis on global perspective and appreciation for diverse civilizations.

**Reasoning Over Authority**: The stories demonstrate observable cause-and-effect moral reasoning ("kindness produces cooperation; cruelty produces resistance") rather than requiring obedience to arbitrary commands, encouraging children to understand ethical principles rationally.

These pedagogical alignments explain the book's warm reception among progressive educators and its successful integration into school curricula across the United States.

## Literary Quality and Adaptational Skill

Babbitt's second collection demonstrates her continued mastery of cross-cultural literary adaptation. She achieved successful adaptation through:

**Narrative Clarity**: Each story moves forward with clear plot development, maintaining children's engagement while avoiding unnecessary complexity.

**Accessible Language**: The prose employs vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for elementary readers or parent read-alouds, making the stories comprehensible without condescension.

**Memorable Characters**: Animal protagonists—elephants, oxen, crabs, goats, quails—are vividly depicted with distinct personalities, making the tales engaging and characters memorable.

**Clear Moral Focus**: Each story concludes with a clear moral lesson, ensuring children understand the intended ethical teaching without heavy-handed didacticism.

**Cultural Authenticity**: While adapting for Western audiences, Babbitt retained Indian settings, animals, and cultural contexts, respecting the stories' origins rather than inappropriately Westernizing them.

**Age-Appropriate Content**: Babbitt selected and adapted stories suitable for children, avoiding tales with violence, complex theology, or themes beyond young readers' understanding.

This careful craftsmanship demonstrates respect for both the Buddhist source tradition and the children who constitute her audience, achieving successful cross-cultural literary communication.

## Illustrations and Visual Appeal

Ellsworth Young's illustrations continued the artistic quality established in the first volume, providing visual representation of Indian landscapes, animals, and scenes that enhanced both literary enjoyment and educational value. The images depicted elephants, water buffaloes, monkeys, crabs, and other creatures in recognizably Indian settings, helping American children visualize unfamiliar environments and species.

In an era before widespread photographic reproduction in children's books and long before digital media, these illustrations served important educational functions: they introduced children to the appearance of Asian animals, depicted Indian architectural elements and landscape features, and created visual associations that made the stories more memorable. The artistic quality also added prestige to the volume, signaling that these ancient Asian tales merited the same careful presentation as European fairy tales and classical literature.

## Reception and Legacy

"More Jataka Tales" enjoyed success comparable to its predecessor, though the first volume remained the more widely known work. Together, the two books established Babbitt as a pioneering figure in multicultural children's literature and secured the Jatakas as established elements in American elementary education and children's library collections.

The work's influence extended beyond immediate readership:

**Educational Adoption**: Schools and libraries across the United States acquired the volume, making it accessible to generations of children from the 1920s through subsequent decades.

**Publishing Model**: Babbitt's success encouraged other publishers to commission adaptations of world religious and folklore literature for children, gradually diversifying American children's literature.

**Cultural Bridge**: The book continued introducing Western children to Buddhist ethics and Asian cultural traditions, fostering cross-cultural appreciation during a period of increasing global interconnection.

**Enduring Availability**: The work remained in print through numerous editions from various publishers, demonstrating sustained demand across generations. Its entry into public domain has enabled continued accessibility through digital platforms.

The stories' timeless moral lessons—wisdom sees beyond appearances, unity provides strength, kindness transforms others, virtue protects from danger—remain as relevant to contemporary children as to 1920s readers, explaining the work's persistent appeal across a century of social and cultural change.

## Digital Access and Contemporary Relevance

"More Jataka Tales" is freely available as a public domain work through multiple digital repositories. Project Gutenberg offers the complete text in various electronic formats suitable for modern devices, while the Internet Archive provides scanned copies of early editions, preserving original illustrations, typography, and historical bibliographic features. An audio version is also available through LibriVox, making the stories accessible to visually impaired readers and those who prefer auditory learning.

These digital versions ensure the work remains accessible to educators, families, and readers worldwide, continuing Babbitt's century-old project of sharing Buddhist wisdom with new generations. In an era of increasing interest in mindfulness, cross-cultural education, and character development programs in schools, these ancient Buddhist tales adapted for children remain remarkably relevant, offering time-tested ethical wisdom in engaging, accessible form.
