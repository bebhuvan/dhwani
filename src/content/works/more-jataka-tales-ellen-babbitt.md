## Overview

Ellen C. Babbitt's *More Jataka Tales* (1922), sequel to her 1912 collection, continues adapting Buddhist jātaka stories from the Pali Canon for American children. Illustrated by Ellsworth Young, the work presents additional moral fables demonstrating Buddhist ethical principles through animal protagonists.
