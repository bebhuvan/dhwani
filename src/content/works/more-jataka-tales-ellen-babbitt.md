description: |
  Ellen C. Babbitt's *More Jataka Tales* (1922) emerges as a significant scholarly and pedagogical intervention in early 20th-century cross-cultural literary translation, representing a pivotal moment in Western intellectual engagement with Buddhist narrative traditions. Published during the Progressive Era's heightened transnational cultural exchange, the work meticulously adapts canonical jātaka stories from the Pali Buddhist textual corpus, transforming complex philosophical narratives into accessible children's literature. These stories, originally composed between 300 BCE and 400 CE, traditionally served as didactic parables illustrating Buddhist ethical principles through anthropomorphic animal protagonists, demonstrating sophisticated moral philosophies embedded in narrative form. Babbitt, an educator associated with Teachers College at Columbia University, participated in a broader intellectual movement that sought to introduce Eastern philosophical traditions to American audiences, contributing to nascent comparative religious and cultural studies. Her careful translations preserve the intricate moral architectures of the original texts while rendering them comprehensible to young Western readers, effectively functioning as a scholarly-pedagogical bridge between Indian philosophical heritage and American cultural understanding. The collection, illustrated by Ellsworth Young, includes narratives that explore themes of compassion, wisdom, self-sacrifice, and ethical behavior, reflecting core Buddhist philosophical concepts. By presenting these stories to children, Babbitt not only expanded cross-cultural literary dialogue but also contributed to a more nuanced, empathetic understanding of Indian philosophical and narrative traditions during a period of intense colonial scholarly interest in Asian religious texts.
