# A Vedic Reader for Students

## Overview
Designed to accompany Macdonell’s *Vedic Grammar for Students*, this reader introduces intermediate Sanskrit students to authentic Vedic texts. The selections illustrate poetic meters, archaic verb forms, and religious vocabulary, providing a bridge between elementary Sanskrit study and direct engagement with the Rigveda, Atharvaveda, and Brāhmaṇa prose.

## Highlights
Each passage is followed by detailed grammatical commentary, cultural context, and cross-references to Whitney and Delbrück. The vocabulary list at the end consolidates core roots and compounds, while an index of verb forms helps learners navigate the older language stage compared with Classical Sanskrit.

## Access Notes
The Internet Archive reproduction offers clear scans of the Devanagari and transliterated text, supported by OCR that simplifies searching for individual hymns or grammatical constructions.
