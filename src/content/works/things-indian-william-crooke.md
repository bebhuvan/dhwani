description: |
  William Crooke's "Things Indian" (1906) represents a pivotal anthropological and ethnographic exploration of Indian cultural landscape during the late British Colonial period. Published at the height of the British Raj, the work provides a comprehensive scholarly examination of Indian social structures, cultural practices, religious traditions, and indigenous knowledge systems through a colonial scholarly lens. Crooke, a distinguished British administrator and ethnographer serving in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, brought meticulous scholarly observation and extensive archival research to documenting the nuanced complexities of Indian society. The text is particularly significant for its detailed ethnographic documentation of regional customs, folklore, social hierarchies, and cultural practices across multiple Indian provinces, offering contemporary scholars a critical primary source for understanding late 19th and early 20th-century Indian sociocultural dynamics. Drawing from extensive fieldwork, administrative interactions, and local informants, Crooke's work transcends mere colonial documentation by providing granular insights into indigenous social systems, religious practices, linguistic diversity, and community structures. His methodology, while inherently influenced by colonial perspectives, nonetheless represents an early systematic attempt at comprehensive cultural documentation. The work becomes especially valuable in understanding the intricate social fabric of Indian communities during a transformative historical period marked by colonial administrative interventions, emerging nationalist sentiments, and significant cultural transitions. For contemporary scholars of Indian studies, colonial historiography, and anthropological research, "Things Indian" remains a crucial text that bridges metropolitan scholarly perspectives with localized cultural understanding, offering nuanced glimpses into complex Indian social realities of the early 20th century.

# Things Indian

## Overview

*Things Indian: Being Discursive Notes on Various Subjects Connected with India* (1906) represents William Crooke's most accessible contribution to colonial-era reference literature on the Indian subcontinent. Published by John Murray, London, this 570-page encyclopedic work synthesized three decades of ethnographic observation from Crooke's tenure in the Indian Civil Service. Unlike his earlier four-volume *Tribes and Castes of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh* (1896), which served official administrative purposes within the Ethnographic Survey of India, *Things Indian* addressed a broader educated readership seeking comprehensive information about Indian culture, religion, customs, and material life organized in discursive alphabetical entries.

The work emerged from Crooke's extensive administrative experience as Magistrate and Collector across multiple districts of the North-Western Provinces—including Etah, Saharanpur, Gorakhpur, and Mirzapur—where he exercised judicial and revenue authority over approximately 300,000 people. This administrative positioning provided unprecedented access to local informants, religious practices, caste structures, agricultural systems, and folk traditions that formed the empirical basis for his ethnographic documentation. *Things Indian* distilled these observations into alphabetically arranged essays covering subjects ranging from festivals, marriage customs, and superstitions to economic practices, architecture, and mythology, each entry combining administrative data with folklore materials.

The subtitle "discursive notes" signals Crooke's methodology: rather than brief dictionary definitions, entries provide extended explanatory essays synthesizing ethnographic observation, administrative records, and materials contributed by Indian collaborators. This approach reflected Crooke's distinctive focus on contemporary rural culture as lived and practiced, distinguishing his work from antiquarian reconstructions or Brahmanical textual traditions favored by orientalist scholars. The volume included bibliographical references and an index, establishing scholarly apparatus appropriate for colonial administrators, missionaries, and metropolitan readers seeking authoritative information about Indian society.

## About the Author — William Crooke

William Crooke (1848–1923) was born in Macroom, County Cork, Ireland, and educated at Trinity College Dublin before joining the Indian Civil Service in 1871. He spent his entire 25-year ICS career in the North-Western Provinces and Oudh (modern Uttar Pradesh), serving continuously until 1896 when personality conflicts ended his advancement. Contemporary H.A. Rose characterized Crooke as "too outspoken a critic of the mechanically efficient 'Secretariat' system" to progress further within colonial bureaucracy, suggesting his ethnographic interests conflicted with administrative priorities.

Crooke's major scholarly output concentrated during and after his ICS years. He transformed Richard Carnac Temple's journal into *North Indian Notes and Queries* (1891–1896), narrowing geographical focus to North India and Aryan-language regions while publishing contributions primarily from Indian informants. His two-volume *Popular Religion and Folklore of Northern India* (1894, revised 1896) examined practical Hinduism in rural contexts, moving beyond missionary perspectives and Vedic scholarship to document living traditions and local deity worship. The government-commissioned *Tribes and Castes of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh* established Crooke as Herbert Hope Risley's "principal rival" in debates about caste definition, with Crooke advocating occupational theories against Risley's racial classifications.

After retiring from India in 1896, Crooke maintained scholarly engagement through the Folklore Society, serving as president (1911–1912) and editor of *Folk-lore* journal (1915–1923). He received honorary doctorates from Oxford (1919) and Dublin (1920), and election as Fellow of the British Academy (1923). Richard Mercer Dorson later identified him as "the central figure in Anglo-Indian folklore," though scholars have noted his editorial interventions sometimes imposed interpretive frameworks on source materials. Crooke died at Cheltenham on 25 October 1923.

## The Work

**Scope and Methodology:**

*Things Indian* organized encyclopedic coverage of Indian subjects through alphabetized discursive entries addressing caste structures, religious festivals, agricultural practices, architectural forms, marriage customs, mythology, superstitions, economic systems, and material culture. Each entry synthesized multiple sources: Crooke's direct administrative observations, ethnographic data collected through official channels, folklore materials contributed by Indian informants (particularly Pandit Ram Gharib Chaube, who provided approximately one-third of Crooke's journal content), and comparative references to existing scholarly literature. The "discursive notes" format allowed extended explanatory essays rather than brief definitions, reflecting Crooke's preference for contextual documentation over taxonomic classification.

Crooke's methodology emphasized contemporary rural practice over historical reconstruction, placing ethnographic subjects "in the rural society—its everyday culture, its age-old customs" rather than privileging Brahmanical texts or Vedic sources. This represented a methodological advance within colonial ethnography: Crooke acknowledged folklore sources with precise geographical locations and identified informant contributions, unusual transparency for the period. His approach documented living traditions as practiced in North Indian villages during the 1870s–1890s, capturing ritual observances, seasonal festivals, craft techniques, kinship patterns, and popular religious beliefs as encountered through administrative governance.

The work's organization facilitated quick reference for colonial administrators, missionaries, and educated metropolitan readers seeking authoritative information about specific Indian subjects. Bibliographical references and indexing established scholarly apparatus supporting the volume's claim to comprehensive coverage, while the discursive entry format accommodated Crooke's observational style and accumulation of administrative experience across multiple districts. The alphabetical structure, however, fragmented systemic analysis, presenting Indian culture as discrete topics rather than integrated social formations.

**Historical Context:**

*Things Indian* emerged within the institutional framework of late nineteenth-century colonial anthropology, shaped by administrative requirements for ethnographic knowledge. The Government of India's Ethnographic Survey program, initiated in the 1860s and formalized through the 1901 Census operations under Herbert Risley, aimed to systematically document India's "tribes and castes" for administrative governance. Crooke's earlier four-volume handbook served this official program, while *Things Indian* represented a parallel commercial publication addressing broader metropolitan audiences increasingly interested in imperial subjects.

Colonial anthropology of this period served multiple functions: facilitating administrative control through classification systems, satisfying metropolitan curiosity about imperial territories, providing intelligence for missionary activity, and establishing intellectual frameworks justifying British rule through evolutionary theories. Crooke's work participated in these projects while reflecting tensions between administrative ethnography (focused on contemporary governance needs) and antiquarian scholarship (privileging textual traditions and historical reconstruction). His emphasis on living rural culture rather than Sanskrit literature positioned him within practical administrative anthropology, though his folklore interests extended beyond purely governmental applications.

The 1906 publication coincided with intensifying debates about Indian nationalism, social reform movements, and emerging criticisms of colonial ethnographic representation. While Crooke documented contemporary practices, his interpretive frameworks reflected evolutionary assumptions about "primitive" survivals and civilizational hierarchies common to British anthropology. The alphabetical encyclopedia format itself embodied colonial knowledge organization: fragmenting Indian culture into discrete, manageable entries suitable for administrative reference rather than recognizing complex historical dynamics or Indian intellectual traditions.

## Significance

**Contemporary Reception:**

*Things Indian* functioned as standard reference material for colonial administrators, missionaries, and metropolitan readers seeking comprehensive information about Indian subjects during the early twentieth century. The work's encyclopedic scope, alphabetical organization, and Crooke's established reputation through the ICS and Folklore Society positioned it as authoritative documentation within colonial knowledge systems. Contemporary reception valued the volume's synthesis of administrative experience with ethnographic observation, providing practical information about customs, festivals, and social structures encountered in governance and missionary work. The commercial publication by John Murray, London's prominent publisher, ensured metropolitan circulation beyond official administrative channels.

**Later Assessment:**

Subsequent scholarship has identified significant colonial biases structuring Crooke's ethnographic documentation while recognizing the historical value of his observational data. Modern anthropologists of India rarely consult Crooke's handbooks, which have been criticized as colonialist misrepresentation reflecting elitist biases and orientalist frameworks. Shahid Amin noted how Crooke and George Grierson presented static views of Indian society, ignoring rural social change and historical dynamics. Critical assessments emphasize how colonial ethnography, including Crooke's work, entrenched stereotypes and justified policies of social division while claiming objective documentation.

Reassessments by scholars including C.J. Fuller have examined Crooke's contributions as products of specific institutional contexts, noting that his handbooks "were arguably the best ethnographic accounts produced in the British Empire" before 1899, superior to metropolitan armchair ethnology because authors possessed extensive direct experience. Sadhana Naithani identified Crooke's *North Indian Notes and Queries* as demonstrating "the emergence and growth of that brand of ethnography for which Crooke should be better known," emphasizing his focus on contemporary popular culture rather than antiquarian reconstruction. However, such reassessments acknowledge fundamental limitations: colonial power relations structured informant interactions, evolutionary frameworks distorted cultural interpretation, and administrative purposes shaped documentation priorities.

**Value for Researchers:**

*Things Indian* retains documentary value as historical evidence of early twentieth-century colonial knowledge production and as a snapshot of North Indian rural culture during the 1870s–1890s as filtered through administrative observation. Researchers studying the history of anthropology, colonial governance, folklore studies, and orientalist representation utilize Crooke's work to analyze how British administrators constructed ethnographic knowledge and disseminated it through reference publications. The volume documents specific festivals, customs, material culture, and social practices observed during Crooke's tenure, providing comparative data for historical studies of cultural change despite interpretive limitations.

The work also illuminates collaborative dimensions of colonial ethnography: Crooke's reliance on Indian informants, particularly Pandit Ram Gharib Chaube, demonstrates how ethnographic knowledge resulted from unequal collaborative relationships rather than solely European observation. This raises questions about authorship, intellectual labor, and knowledge extraction within colonial contexts. For contemporary researchers, *Things Indian* functions less as reliable ethnographic authority than as primary source material requiring critical analysis of its colonial frameworks, assumptions, and silences while extracting specific observational data about late nineteenth-century North Indian society.
