# The Bengal Tenancy Act (Annotated Edition)

## Overview
Published four years after the landmark Act VIII of 1885, Rampini’s manual collates the statute alongside the 1886 amending act, government notifications, and High Court circulars. It was intended for district officers administering rent law in Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa, providing immediate access to authoritative interpretations.

## Highlights
Extensive footnotes extract decisions from the Calcutta High Court that clarify occupancy rights, enhancement suits, and procedures for recording raiyats. Appendices compile rules issued by the Board of Revenue, specimen registers for village officers, and schedules detailing court fees, making the volume a working handbook for settlement staff.

## Access Notes
The University of Toronto scan supplies clear text and OCR, enabling quick navigation between statutory clauses, judicial rulings, and administrative forms for researchers studying colonial agrarian policy.
