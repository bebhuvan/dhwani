# Maratha Rajas of Tanjore

## Overview

K. R. Subramanian's 119-page work (1928) documents the Bhonsle Maratha dynasty of Tanjore (Thanjavur), a fascinating case of cultural synthesis. This cadet branch of Shivaji's family, founded by his half-brother Venkoji (Ekoji) in 1676, ruled Tamil-speaking territories until 1855, creating unique blend of Maratha and Tamil cultures.

The chronicle spans from Venkoji's establishment of the kingdom through the culturally prolific reign of Serfoji II (1798-1832), noted patron of Carnatic music, arts, and sciences. It documents how these Maratha rulers adopted Tamil language and cultural practices while maintaining Marathi administrative traditions, their conflicts with remnant Nayak powers, complex relationships with the Nawab of Arcot, evolution into British subsidiary alliance, and extraordinary cultural patronage that made Thanjavur a major center of South Indian arts. Drawing on Marathi inscriptions and Tamil chronicles, the work illuminates this unique regional synthesis. Essential for Tamil Nadu history, Maratha studies, and understanding cultural adaptation by migrant ruling dynasties. Available through Archive.org (DLI collection), public domain.
