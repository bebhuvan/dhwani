# The History of the Bengali Language

## Overview

Published as a series of lectures delivered at the University of Calcutta's Post-Graduate Department, this work examines Bengali language origins and historical development from ancient times to modern usage. Majumdar challenges Sir George Grierson's theories on Aryan vernacular origins while analyzing Dravidian linguistic influences, phonological evolution, and the relationships between Pali, Prakrit dialects, and modern Bengali. Majumdar revised and delivered these lectures after losing his eyesight in 1914, relying on his memory to produce this work in Bengali historical linguistics.

## About Bijay Chandra Majumdar

Bijay Chandra Majumdar (1861-1942) was a Bengali poet, linguist, archaeologist, anthropologist, and researcher. Despite losing his eyesight in 1914, he joined the University of Calcutta as a professor in 1918, demonstrating remarkable dedication to scholarship. He is particularly known for his linguistic studies on Charyapada and received Nobel Prize nominations for Literature in 1937 and 1939. His multidisciplinary expertise encompassed literature, linguistics, archaeology, and cultural studies.

## Historical Context

The work emerged in 1920 during a period of intensive linguistic research in Bengal and India more broadly. As part of the University of Calcutta's Post-Graduate Department lecture series, these presentations contributed to academic debates about Indo-Aryan language development and the role of Dravidian substrata in Bengali evolution. The lectures engaged with contemporary linguistic theories, particularly those advanced by Sir George Grierson in the Linguistic Survey of India.

## Academic Significance

This 328-page work provides systematic examination of Bengali language development through historical and comparative linguistic methods. Majumdar's analysis of Dravidian influences on Bengali phonology and his examination of the evolutionary relationships between Pali, various Prakrit dialects, and modern Bengali contributed to understanding the complex linguistic history of Eastern India. His challenge to prevailing theories represented independent Indian scholarly engagement with linguistic questions during the colonial period.

## Content and Structure

The lectures examine:
- Origins of the Bengali language in ancient linguistic traditions
- Dravidian linguistic influences on Bengali development
- Phonological evolution from ancient to modern Bengali
- Relationships between Pali, Prakrit dialects, and Bengali
- Critique of Sir George Grierson's theories on Aryan vernacular origins
- Historical development through various periods

## Digital Preservation
