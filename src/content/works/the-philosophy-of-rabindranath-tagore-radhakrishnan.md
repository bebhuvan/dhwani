  Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan's "The Philosophy of Rabindranath Tagore" (1918), published by Macmillan in London and Calcutta while Radhakrishnan taught at Madras Presidency College, represents one of the earliest systematic English-language expositions demonstrating that Tagore (1861-1941)—internationally celebrated as Nobel laureate poet (1913), Bengali Renaissance polymath, educator, social reformer, and cultural nationalist—articulated sophisticated philosophical positions integrating Vedantic metaphysics, humanistic ethics, aesthetic theory, and spiritual universalism beyond his literary achievements. This 300-page study, Radhakrishnan's third book following his M.A. thesis "The Ethics of the Vedanta" (1908) and "The Philosophy of the Upanishads" (1914), emerged from the young philosopher's engagement with Tagore's English-language works available by 1918: poetry collections including "Gitanjali" (1912), "The Gardener" (1913), "Fruit-Gathering" (1916), and "Stray Birds" (1916); essay compilations "Sadhana: The Realisation of Life" (1913) and "Personality" (1917); dramas including "The King of the Dark Chamber" (1910); and Tagore's English translations of his Bengali writings. Radhakrishnan analyzes these literary and philosophical texts to extract systematic philosophical positions on metaphysics (reality's ultimate nature), epistemology (knowledge and intuition), aesthetics (beauty's relationship to truth), ethics (love, service, and individual-social relationships), and soteriology (spiritual realization through divine-human unity) demonstrating Tagore's thought's coherence despite its expression through poetry, drama, and essays rather than systematic philosophical treatises. The study addresses Western audiences increasingly interested in Indian philosophy following Tagore's 1913 Nobel Prize but often perceiving his work primarily as mystical poetry rather than serious philosophical reflection, while also engaging Bengali intellectual circles debating Tagore's relationship to traditional Hindu philosophy and his innovations departing from classical systems. Radhakrishnan interprets Tagore's philosophy largely through Advaita Vedanta frameworks emphasizing non-dual ultimate reality (Brahman), individual souls' essential identity with universal consciousness, and spiritual realization through transcending empirical limitations—an interpretive strategy aligning with Radhakrishnan's own neo-Vedantic commitments while potentially minimizing Tagore's departures from classical Advaita including his greater emphasis on divine personality, human relationships' intrinsic value, and social-ethical dimensions beyond individual moksha. The work's five chapters systematically examine: Tagore's philosophical worldview integrating Vedantic monism with dynamic evolutionary cosmos and divine creativity; poetry-philosophy relationships where aesthetic experience provides immediate intuitive access to ultimate reality complementing discursive reason; Tagore's message to India emphasizing cultural nationalism, educational reform, rural reconstruction, and spiritual renaissance over political nationalism or wholesale Westernization; and his universal message to humanity advocating spiritual unity transcending sectarian divisions while respecting cultural diversity. Radhakrishnan extensively quotes Tagore's English works, analyzing passages for philosophical implications regarding consciousness, freedom, beauty, love, divinity, and human purpose, demonstrating how poetic language expresses profound metaphysical insights through symbol, metaphor, and emotional resonance rather than abstract conceptual analysis. The philosophical reconstruction emphasizes several interconnected themes: ultimate reality's personal-impersonal dual aspects reconciling Vedantic Brahman with devotional theism; finite individuals' participation in infinite consciousness through creative expression, love, and service; beauty's metaphysical significance as manifestation of divine harmony; intuitive knowledge's primacy over purely rational intellection for grasping ultimate truth; and spiritual life's integration of contemplation, aesthetic creativity, ethical action, and social engagement rather than ascetic renunciation. Radhakrishnan positions Tagore within Indian philosophical traditions while emphasizing his innovations: criticizing caste hierarchy, challenging sectarian orthodoxy, advocating women's education and social participation, promoting interfaith dialogue, and integrating Western humanistic values with Vedantic spirituality. The work appeared at crucial moment in Indian cultural nationalism when Bengali intellectuals negotiated between tradition and modernity, colonial and indigenous knowledge systems, spiritual identity and material progress—contexts making systematic articulation of Tagore's philosophical contributions politically and culturally significant beyond purely academic philosophy. Tagore's response to the book, expressed in December 1918 letter to Radhakrishnan, acknowledged being "pleasantly surprised at the earnestness of endeavour" while noting interpretive differences: "Though my criticism of a book may not be seriously accepted, I can say that it surpassed my expectation." This diplomatic praise with implicit reservation reflected Tagore's awareness that Radhakrishnan's systematic Vedantic framework potentially constrained his more fluid, poetic, humanistic philosophical approach resisting reduction to classical philosophical categories. The study established Radhakrishnan's reputation as interpreter capable of making Indian thought accessible to Western philosophical audiences while defending its sophistication—skills later demonstrated in his monumental "Indian Philosophy" (1923-1927) establishing him as preeminent twentieth-century authority on Indian philosophical traditions. For Tagore studies, the work's significance lies partly in establishing philosophical interpretation traditions influencing subsequent scholarship while also documenting early tensions between systematic philosophical reconstruction and Tagore's literary-philosophical hybrid expressions resisting conventional categorization. Modern scholarship critically assesses Radhakrishnan's Advaita-centric interpretation, noting how his neo-Vedantic frameworks potentially obscured Tagore's departures from classical non-dualism including his greater emphasis on relational ontology, divine personality, human love's intrinsic rather than merely instrumental value, and socio-political engagement's spiritual significance. Recent Tagore studies emphasize his philosophical innovations beyond traditional Indian systems: integrating Western Romanticism and humanism with Vedantic and Vaishnava traditions; developing relational ontology where individuals' distinctiveness persists within ultimate unity; advocating engaged spirituality through education, artistic creation, and social reform rather than ascetic withdrawal; and articulating cosmopolitan cultural nationalism transcending both parochial traditionalism and uncritical Westernization. Despite interpretive limitations, Radhakrishnan's study remains valuable for documenting early twentieth-century reception of Tagore's thought, demonstrating how neo-Vedantic intellectuals framed his contributions for academic philosophical discourse, and preserving contemporary analysis of works later overshadowed by focus on Tagore's Bengali writings unavailable to English readers in 1918.

## Publication Context and Early Career

"The Philosophy of Rabindranath Tagore" appeared in 1918 when Radhakrishnan (thirty years old) taught at Madras Presidency College, establishing his emerging reputation as philosopher capable of systematic exposition making Indian thought accessible to Western philosophical audiences. The work followed his M.A. thesis on Vedanta ethics (1908) and "The Philosophy of the Upanishads" (1914), documenting his developing expertise in Vedantic philosophy and neo-Vedantic interpretation strategies positioning classical Indian traditions as addressing universal philosophical concerns through culturally specific vocabularies.

The study addressed multiple audiences: Western readers intrigued by Tagore's 1913 Nobel Prize recognition but often perceiving him primarily as mystical poet rather than serious philosopher; Indian intellectuals debating Tagore's relationship to traditional Hindu philosophy and assessing his innovations; and Bengali cultural nationalists seeking systematic articulation of Tagore's contributions to demonstrate Indian civilization's philosophical sophistication. Publishing with Macmillan—major academic press with both London and Indian operations—positioned the work for international scholarly circulation while establishing Radhakrishnan's authority as interpreter mediating between Indian and Western intellectual traditions.

Tagore's December 1918 response acknowledged the book's merit while implicitly noting interpretive tensions. His praise for Radhakrishnan's "earnestness of endeavour" combined with observation that results "surpassed my expectation" suggested both appreciation for serious philosophical engagement and awareness that systematic Vedantic reconstruction potentially constrained his more fluid literary-philosophical approach resisting conventional philosophical categorization.

## Interpretive Approach and Content

Radhakrishnan analyzes Tagore's English-language works—poetry collections, essay compilations, dramas—extracting systematic philosophical positions on metaphysics, epistemology, aesthetics, ethics, and spiritual realization. His methodology involves extensive quotation followed by philosophical explication demonstrating how poetic language expresses profound metaphysical insights through symbol, metaphor, and emotional resonance complementing abstract conceptual analysis.

The interpretation emphasizes Tagore's integration of Vedantic non-dualism with dynamic evolutionary cosmos, divine creativity, and human relationships' intrinsic value. Radhakrishnan frames this as reconciling Advaita's impersonal Brahman with devotional theism's personal deity, individual souls' essential unity with universal consciousness alongside their distinct finite perspectives, and spiritual realization through engaged worldly activity rather than ascetic renunciation.

Five chapters examine: Tagore's systematic worldview; poetry-philosophy relationships where aesthetic experience provides immediate intuitive access to ultimate reality; his message to India emphasizing spiritual renaissance, cultural nationalism, and educational-social reform; and his universal message advocating spiritual unity transcending sectarian divisions. Throughout, Radhakrishnan positions Tagore as both continuing classical Vedantic traditions and innovating beyond them through greater emphasis on divine personality, creative expression, social ethics, and humanistic values.

## Significance and Critical Assessment

The work established important precedents: demonstrating Tagore's philosophical significance beyond literary achievements; providing systematic reconstruction accessible to academic philosophical discourse; and documenting early twentieth-century neo-Vedantic interpretive strategies. Radhakrishnan's success launching his distinguished career partly derived from effectively presenting Indian thought—whether classical Upanishadic philosophy or contemporary Tagore's innovations—as sophisticated, systematic, and relevant to modern philosophical concerns.

Modern Tagore scholarship critically reassesses Radhakrishnan's Advaita-centric interpretation, noting potential tensions with Tagore's own philosophical emphases: his relational ontology preserving individual distinctiveness within ultimate unity; his greater stress on divine personality and devotional love; his integration of social-political engagement with spiritual life; and his resistance to systematic philosophical categorization preferring literary-philosophical hybrid expressions. Recent studies emphasize Tagore's innovations beyond both classical Indian systems and Western philosophical traditions, his integration of Romantic aesthetics with Vedantic-Vaishnava spirituality, and his cosmopolitan cultural nationalism transcending parochial traditionalism and uncritical Westernization.

Despite interpretive limitations, the work remains valuable for historians examining early twentieth-century Tagore reception, documenting neo-Vedantic intellectual strategies, and preserving contemporary analysis of English works later overshadowed by focus on Bengali writings unavailable to international audiences in 1918.
