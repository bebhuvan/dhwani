  Here's an enhanced scholarly description:
  
  Prabhakara Misra's Bṛhatī represents a seminal scholarly intervention in classical Indian philosophical discourse, emerging during the intellectually fertile post-Gupta period characterized by systematic philosophical consolidation. Composed as a comprehensive commentary on Sabarasvamin's Bhashya of Jaimini's Purva Mimamsa Sutras, the work critically examines Vedic hermeneutics, epistemology, and ritual interpretation within the Mimamsa philosophical tradition. Situated in the 7th-8th centuries CE, a period of significant scholastic innovation, the text establishes the Prabhakara sub-school of Mimamsa, distinguished by its nuanced epistemological framework and rigorous philosophical methodology. Prabhakara Misra's distinctive contribution lies in his theory of triputipratyaksha (threefold immediate cognition), which elaborates a sophisticated model of perceptual knowledge that challenges contemporaneous philosophical paradigms. The commentary systematically interrogates fundamental philosophical questions regarding the nature of knowledge, perception, and ritual injunctions, positioning itself at the intersection of Brahmanical hermeneutic traditions and epistemological inquiry. By developing a robust theoretical apparatus that emphasizes the self-validity of knowledge and the primacy of Vedic scriptural injunctions, Bṛhatī significantly influenced subsequent Indian philosophical discourse, particularly within the Mimamsa and Vedanta schools. The work exemplifies the intellectual sophistication of medieval Indian philosophical scholarship, demonstrating the complex theoretical negotiations undertaken by scholar-philosophers in interpreting religious, linguistic, and metaphysical phenomena. Its meticulous analytical approach and conceptual depth continue to represent a critical resource for understanding the sophisticated intellectual traditions of classical Indian philosophy.

# Bṛhatī: Commentary on Śābara Bhāṣya

## Overview

The Bṛhatī is Prabhakara Misra's foundational commentary on Śābarasvāmin's Bhāṣya, which itself comments on Jaimini's Pūrva Mīmāṃsā Sūtras. This 107-page 1932 edition (Vidyavilas Press, Benares) preserves a work that established one of the two major sub-schools of Mīmāṃsā philosophy, fundamentally shaping how Vedic texts were interpreted and how epistemological questions were addressed in medieval Indian thought.

## Historical Context

Prabhakara Miśra (7th-8th century CE) founded the Prābhākara school of Mīmāṃsā, which competed with Kumārila Bhaṭṭa's Bhāṭṭa school for philosophical supremacy within the Mīmāṃsā tradition. While both sub-schools agreed on the eternality and authority of the Vedas and the primacy of dharma determined through Vedic injunctions, they differed significantly on epistemological questions, theory of error, and the nature of cognition.

## Content

**Epistemological Innovations**:
- **Triputipratyaksha**: Theory of "threefold immediate cognition" where every act of knowing immediately reveals three elements: the knower (pramatṛ), the known object (prameya), and the act of knowing itself (pramāṇa)
- **Akhyāti**: Distinctive theory of error rejecting the concept of erroneous cognition—what others call "error" is actually non-apprehension of distinction

**Theory of Knowledge**:
- Svataḥ prāmāṇya: Self-validity of knowledge—cognitions are intrinsically valid unless defeated
- Defense against skepticism and Buddhist epistemological challenges
- Analysis of six pramāṇas (means of valid knowledge): perception, inference, verbal testimony, comparison, postulation, and non-apprehension

**Vedic Hermeneutics**:
- Vidhi (injunction) as primary meaning of Vedic sentences
- Complex rules for interpreting ritual prescriptions
- Resolution of apparent contradictions in Vedic texts
- Theory of śabda (verbal testimony) as independent means of knowledge

**Philosophy of Action**:
- Bhāvanā (productive force) as key concept—the power that injunctions have to produce action
- Analysis of how Vedic commands generate obligation
- Relationship between knowledge and action

## Significance

**Philosophical School Formation**: The Bṛhatī established Prābhākara as an independent philosophical lineage within Mīmāṃsā, creating a tradition that maintained vitality through centuries of scholarship in India's traditional educational institutions.

**Epistemological Contributions**: Prabhakara's theories, especially his analysis of immediate cognition and rejection of error as a category, represent sophisticated contributions to epistemology, offering alternatives to both Buddhist and Nyāya positions.

**Influence**: The Prābhākara-Bhāṭṭa divide became one of the standard philosophical divisions in medieval Indian thought. Later philosophers had to position themselves relative to these sub-schools, and their debates animated philosophical education in traditional tols.

**Hermeneutical Method**: Prabhakara's methods of Vedic interpretation influenced how religious texts were read across traditions, contributing to the sophisticated hermeneutical techniques developed in Indian intellectual culture.

**Comparative Philosophy**: Prabhakara's epistemology, especially his direct realist theory and analysis of error, offers interesting comparisons with Western philosophical debates about perception, knowledge, and skepticism.
