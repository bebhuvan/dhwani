description: "The Nyaya Sutras attributed to Akshapada Gautama represent ancient India's foundational text on logic, epistemology, and dialectics, composed around 150 BCE-100 CE. This systematic work of approximately 530 sutras across five chapters establishes: four valid means of knowledge (perception, inference, comparison, testimony), categories of metaphysical reality, methods for philosophical debate and argumentation, logical fallacies to avoid, and refutations of rival philosophical positions. Beyond formal logic, Nyaya provides comprehensive epistemology analyzing how knowledge arises, what constitutes valid cognition, and how certainty is achieved. The text's influence extended across all Indian philosophical schools—Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain traditions engaged Nyaya's logical methods, adopted its epistemological frameworks, and responded to its arguments. The systematic approach to inference (anumana), the five-membered syllogism, and the detailed taxonomy of logical errors established standards for rigorous philosophical discourse in classical India."
