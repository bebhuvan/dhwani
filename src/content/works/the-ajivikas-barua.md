  Benimadhab Barua's "The Ajivikas" (1920), published by the University of Calcutta as part of the Journal of the Department of Letters, constitutes the first systematic English-language scholarly examination of the Ajivika sect—an ancient Indian heterodox (nāstika) philosophical and ascetic movement contemporaneous with early Buddhism and Jainism that espoused radical determinism (niyati) and persisted until approximately the fourteenth century CE before vanishing from the Indian religious landscape. This pioneering ninety-four-page monograph established foundational historical and doctrinal frameworks for understanding the Ajivikas that subsequent scholarship, most notably A. L. Basham's comprehensive "History and Doctrines of the Ajivikas" (1951), would elaborate and revise through additional textual analysis and archaeological evidence. Barua (1888-1948), appointed University Professor of Pali at Calcutta University in 1925 after becoming the first Asian recipient of a D.Litt. from the University of London (1917) for his dissertation on Indian philosophy from the Vedas to the Buddha, approached the Ajivikas through analysis of scattered references in Buddhist Pali canonical texts (particularly the Tripitaka), Jain Prakrit sources (especially Bhagavati Sutra), Brahmanical Sanskrit literature, and Mauryan-era inscriptions, reconstructing the sect's history, philosophical doctrines, and social organization from fragmentary and often polemical source materials embedded within rival sectarian traditions. The study identifies Makkhali Gosala (Maskarin Gośāla) as the sect's principal systematizer and formulator of its distinctive deterministic philosophy, examining his biographical tradition including his reported association and subsequent schism with Mahavira (founder of Jainism), his establishment of an independent ascetic community, and his articulation of comprehensive fatalistic cosmology denying free will, moral causation (karma), and spiritual efficacy of ascetic practices or ethical conduct in favor of absolute predetermination (niyati) governing all phenomena including spiritual liberation. Barua analyzes core Ajivika philosophical positions as preserved in hostile Buddhist and Jain sources: the doctrine that all beings would automatically attain liberation after fixed cycles of rebirths (approximately 8.4 million mahakalpas) regardless of moral conduct or spiritual discipline; rejection of karmic causation in favor of inherent nature (svabhava) and environmental conditioning (sangati); classification of reality into categories including jiva (souls), ajiva (non-souls), and elements (earth, water, fire, air, ether, joy, sorrow); and elaborate cosmological schemas involving cyclical time, spatial dimensions, and taxonomies of living beings. The monograph examines Ajivika ascetic practices including nakedness (similar to Digambara Jains), strict dietary regulations, wandering mendicancy, and organizational structures featuring hierarchical leadership and institutional continuity across centuries. Barua's work addresses the sect's historical trajectory: its apparent prominence during the Mauryan period when Emperor Ashoka's edicts reference Ajivikas alongside Buddhists, Jains, and Brahmans as recipients of royal patronage and religious tolerance; evidence for Ajivika communities in South India (particularly Karnataka and Tamil Nadu) where inscriptions and literary references suggest continued institutional presence into the medieval period; and eventual disappearance leaving primarily archaeological remains (Barabar and Nagarjuni cave inscriptions dedicated by Ashoka and his grandson Dasharatha to Ajivika ascetics) and textual fragments in rival sectarian literatures. The study engages methodological challenges inherent in reconstructing "heretical" movements known primarily through antagonistic sources produced by doctrinal competitors: distinguishing historical Ajivika positions from polemical misrepresentations, assessing reliability of biographical narratives about Gosala and other teachers, and reconstructing philosophical arguments from fragmentary quotations and critical summaries embedded in Buddhist and Jain philosophical treatises. Barua's scholarship demonstrates early twentieth-century Indological methodology combining philological analysis of classical Indian languages (Pali, Prakrit, Sanskrit), critical evaluation of religious historical sources, and comparative examination of philosophical systems within the broader context of ancient Indian intellectual history. The work appeared during a crucial period in Indian Buddhist scholarship when Bengali intellectuals including Barua, Rahul Sankrityayan, and others were recovering and interpreting Buddhist and heterodox philosophical traditions as part of broader cultural renaissance movements emphasizing India's indigenous intellectual heritage as alternative to both colonial Orientalist scholarship and Hindu nationalist historiography. Barua's subsequent career expanded his examination of ancient Indian heterodox movements through works including "A History of Pre-Buddhistic Indian Philosophy" (1921), "Old Brahmi Inscriptions in the Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves" (1929), and studies of Ashoka's inscriptions, culminating in his recognition as "Tripitakāchārya" (Master of the Three Baskets) in 1944 for contributions to Buddhist textual scholarship. "The Ajivikas" established Barua's scholarly reputation and provided foundational research enabling later comprehensive studies, though subsequent scholarship has revised some interpretations while confirming the basic historical and doctrinal frameworks he established. Modern scholarly reassessment acknowledges the study's pioneering significance while recognizing limitations inherent in early twentieth-century source availability and methodological approaches: Barua lacked access to important Tamil Ajivika references later analyzed by Basham; relied primarily on Buddhist and Jain sources without fully accounting for sectarian bias; and operated within colonial-era Indological frameworks emphasizing textual philology over anthropological, sociological, or comparative religious studies approaches. The work remains essential reading for historians of ancient Indian philosophy, students of heterodox movements, and scholars examining the complex religious pluralism of ancient India where multiple soteriological systems—Vedic Brahmanism, Buddhism, Jainism, Ajivikas, materialist Charvakas, and others—competed intellectually and institutionally while collectively shaping the subcontinental philosophical traditions. The Ajivikas' radical determinism and rejection of karmic causation represent a distinctive position within ancient Indian philosophical debates over free will, moral causation, and liberation, demonstrating the diversity of metaphysical and soteriological speculation in pre-Common Era India beyond the better-preserved Buddhist, Jain, and Brahmanical traditions.

## Scholarly Context and Publication

"The Ajivikas" appeared in 1920 as part of the University of Calcutta's Journal of the Department of Letters, representing one of Benimadhab Barua's earliest major publications following his return to India in 1918 after completing doctoral studies at the University of London. The work emerged from Barua's broader research program examining pre-Buddhist and heterodox Indian philosophical traditions, documented in contemporaneous publications including "A History of Pre-Buddhistic Indian Philosophy" (1921) and his ongoing Pali textual studies that would dominate his academic career at Calcutta University from 1918 until his death in 1948.

The monograph addressed significant gaps in early twentieth-century Western and Indian scholarship on ancient Indian religious history. While Buddhist and Jain traditions had received substantial scholarly attention from European Orientalists and Indian scholars, the Ajivikas remained largely unstudied despite scattered references in canonical Buddhist Pali texts, Jain Prakrit sources, and Mauryan inscriptions. Barua's systematic compilation and analysis of fragmentary source materials provided the first comprehensive English-language treatment of Ajivika history, philosophy, and institutional organization, establishing frameworks that subsequent scholarship would refine and expand.

The publication coincided with the Bengali Buddhist revival movement in which Barua played a central role, alongside figures like Kripasaran Mahasthavir and Rahul Sankrityayan, recovering and promoting Buddhist and heterodox Indian philosophical traditions as alternatives to both colonial Orientalist scholarship and Hindu nationalist historiography. Barua's work on the Ajivikas fit within broader efforts to document India's religious and philosophical pluralism, emphasizing indigenous intellectual achievements and complex doctrinal debates characterizing the ancient period.

## Content and Methodology

The monograph analyzes Ajivika origins, philosophy, and historical development through systematic examination of scattered references in multiple source traditions. Barua identifies Makkhali Gosala (circa 6th century BCE) as the sect's principal systematizer, examining biographical traditions preserved in Buddhist Samaññaphala Sutta and Jain Bhagavati Sutra describing Gosala's association with Mahavira, their eventual schism, and Gosala's establishment of an independent ascetic community articulating comprehensive deterministic philosophy.

The study reconstructs core Ajivika doctrinal positions from fragmentary quotations and critical summaries in rival sectarian texts: radical determinism (niyati) denying free will and moral efficacy; rejection of karmic causation in favor of inherent nature (svabhava) and environmental factors (sangati); cosmological schemas involving cyclical time and fixed liberation periods requiring approximately 8.4 million mahakalpas (vast cosmic cycles) before automatic attainment of moksha regardless of conduct; and elaborate taxonomies of souls, elements, and existential categories. Barua examines how Ajivika philosophy represented a distinctive position within ancient Indian debates over causation, free will, and liberation, contrasting with Buddhist dependent origination, Jain karmic determinism allowing liberation through asceticism, and Brahmanical ritual and philosophical systems.

The monograph addresses Ajivika institutional history through analysis of Mauryan inscriptions (particularly Ashoka's edicts mentioning Ajivikas and cave dedications at Barabar and Nagarjuni), South Indian epigraphic evidence, and literary references in Tamil Sangam literature and later texts suggesting continued Ajivika presence in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu into medieval period. Barua examines ascetic practices including nakedness, dietary restrictions, wandering mendicancy, and organizational structures featuring hierarchical leadership and monastic establishments.

## Significance and Scholarly Legacy

As the pioneering English-language study of the Ajivikas, Barua's monograph established foundational research frameworks enabling subsequent scholarship. A. L. Basham's comprehensive "History and Doctrines of the Ajivikas: A Vanished Indian Religion" (1951) explicitly built upon Barua's work while incorporating additional Tamil sources, archaeological evidence, and more extensive philosophical analysis, acknowledging Barua's pioneering contribution while revising specific interpretations.

For historians of Indian philosophy, the work demonstrates the religious and philosophical pluralism of ancient India, where multiple heterodox movements challenged Vedic-Brahmanical orthodoxy while developing distinctive soteriological systems. The Ajivikas' radical determinism represents an extreme position in ancient debates over free will and moral causation, providing comparative perspective on Buddhist and Jain middle positions between complete determinism and complete free will.

The study contributed to early twentieth-century scholarly recovery of "heterodox" Indian philosophical traditions marginalized in both colonial Orientalist scholarship emphasizing Vedic-Upanishadic texts and Hindu nationalist historiography privileging Brahmanical sources. Barua's work on Buddhist and heterodox movements participated in broader intellectual projects recovering India's philosophical diversity and demonstrating sophisticated indigenous speculative traditions.

Modern scholarship recognizes the monograph's historical significance while noting limitations inherent in early twentieth-century source availability and methodology. Later discoveries of Tamil Ajivika references, refined epigraphic analysis, and more sophisticated approaches to reconstructing "heretical" movements from hostile sources have revised specific interpretations while confirming Barua's basic historical and doctrinal frameworks. The work remains essential reading for understanding ancient Indian religious pluralism and the diversity of philosophical positions regarding causation, determinism, and liberation in pre-Common Era India.
