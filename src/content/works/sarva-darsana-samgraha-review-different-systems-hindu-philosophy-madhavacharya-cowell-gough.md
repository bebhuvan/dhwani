By presenting multiple philosophical perspectives with academic objectivity, the text documents the philosophical diversity of classical Indian thought and facilitates scholarly understanding of intellectual debates during a significant period of Hindu philosophical development. The work critically explores philosophical systems through a comparative lens, demonstrating how different schools of thought engaged with fundamental questions of existence, knowledge, and metaphysical understanding. For scholars of Indian philosophy, the text provides a detailed historical record of philosophical discourse, offering insights into the intellectual methodologies, conceptual frameworks, and argumentative strategies employed by different philosophical traditions.

# The Sarva-Darsana-Samgraha: Review of the Different Systems of Hindu Philosophy

This comprehensive philosophical treatise represents one of the most important medieval surveys of Indian philosophical thought. Madhavacharya's systematic examination of sixteen different philosophical schools provides an invaluable window into the intellectual landscape of 14th-century India, presenting each system's core tenets while building toward the author's Advaita Vedanta perspective. The scholarly translation by Edward Cowell and Archibald Gough makes this foundational work accessible to comparative philosophy and modern academic study.

## About the Authors

**Madhavacharya** (ca. 1296-1386 CE), also known as Vidyaranya Swami, was a distinguished philosopher and Jagadguru of the Śringeri Śarada Pītham who created this masterwork during the height of medieval Indian philosophical discourse. His systematic approach to comparative philosophy demonstrates the sophisticated intellectual environment of his era and his commitment to understanding diverse approaches to ultimate reality.

**Edward Byles Cowell** and **Archibald Edward Gough** were distinguished 19th-century British scholars whose collaborative translation work made classical Sanskrit philosophical texts accessible to Western academic audiences. Their careful attention to philosophical nuance and systematic methodology preserved the intellectual rigor of the original while making it comprehensible to comparative philosophy studies.

## Significance

This work provides essential insights into the diversity and sophistication of Indian philosophical traditions, demonstrating how medieval thinkers engaged with fundamental questions about reality, consciousness, knowledge, and liberation. Madhavacharya's systematic presentation of sixteen schools - from Charvaka materialism to Advaita Vedanta - reveals the breadth of intellectual discourse that characterized classical Indian philosophy.

The work's comparative methodology and systematic organization influenced subsequent philosophical scholarship and continues to serve as a foundational text for understanding the development and interrelationships of Hindu philosophical systems.
