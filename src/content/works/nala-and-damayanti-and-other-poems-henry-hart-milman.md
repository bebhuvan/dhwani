# Nala and Damayanti, and Other Poems

## Overview

Published in 1835 by Oxford's Talboys, this 180-page collection represents one of the earliest English poetic renderings of Sanskrit epic literature. Henry Hart Milman, then Oxford's Professor of Poetry, treated the Nala story from the Mahābhārata not as exotic curiosity but as literary achievement worthy of serious poetic translation—applying the same craft he brought to Greek classics.

Milman's approach differed from literal scholarly translation. Writing in Romantic verse influenced by Byron and Shelley, he aimed to capture the emotional power and narrative sweep of Sanskrit poetry for English readers. The result introduced Victorian audiences to Indian epic poetry as literature, not anthropological specimen.

## About Henry Hart Milman (1791-1868)

Born to physician Sir Francis Milman (doctor to King George III), Henry Hart Milman distinguished himself at Eton and Oxford, winning the Newdigate Prize for poetry. Ordained in 1816, he combined ecclesiastical career with literary and historical scholarship, eventually becoming Dean of St Paul's Cathedral (1849-1868).

As Oxford Professor of Poetry (1821-1831), Milman championed studying world literatures alongside Greek and Latin classics. His dramatic works (*Fazio*, *Anne Boleyn*), historical poems (*Fall of Jerusalem*, *The Martyr of Antioch*), and historical prose (*History of the Jews*, *History of Latin Christianity*) made him a prominent Victorian man of letters.

His approach to religious history—treating biblical and church history with critical scholarly methods—proved controversial but influential. His hymn "Ride On, Ride On in Majesty!" remains sung in churches worldwide. Milman represented Victorian liberal scholarship: deeply Christian yet intellectually open to other cultures and willing to apply rational analysis even to sacred subjects.

## The Translation Achievement

Milman worked from Charles Wilkins' Latin translation of the Nala episode (1787), rendering it into English heroic verse. Without knowing Sanskrit himself, he relied on scholars' interpretations—a common practice when few Englishmen read Sanskrit. Despite this limitation, his poetic sensibility produced a translation that captured narrative drive and emotional resonance.

The verse conveys the Nala story's dramatic arc—divine swayamvara, gambling disaster, separation, disguise, recognition, reunion—through rhythms and imagery familiar to readers of English Romantic poetry. This domestication made Indian epic accessible while inevitably changing its character. Sanskrit's complex meters and layered meanings became Victorian poetic conventions.

Later scholars like Monier Monier-Williams would revise Milman's translation for accuracy, but his pioneering work demonstrated that Sanskrit poetry could speak to Western literary sensibilities, preparing audiences for more scholarly translations that followed.

## Cultural Impact

The 1835 publication coincided with growing British interest in Indian culture. Administrators and missionaries needed understanding of the civilization they governed or sought to convert. Orientalist scholars were uncovering classical texts. Milman's poetic rendering made this learning emotionally engaging, not just intellectually important.

By treating Nala as literature comparable to Homer or Virgil, Milman elevated Indian cultural achievement in British eyes—even as Britain's colonial control tightened. This paradox characterized much Victorian Orientalism: genuine appreciation coupled with imperial power, respect for ancient India alongside denigration of contemporary Indian society.

For Indian readers encountering Milman's version, the English translation of their epic through Victorian poetic forms presented complex feelings—validation through Western recognition, yet loss of original linguistic and cultural nuances.

## This Digital Edition

This Internet Archive preservation offers access to Milman's groundbreaking translation—significant both as early cross-cultural literary work and as artifact of Victorian engagement with Indian civilization. Modern readers can appreciate Milman's poetic achievement while recognizing the cultural translation's inevitable distortions and the colonial context shaping Victorian interest in Sanskrit literature.
