  This distinguished collection by Henry Hart Milman, Dean of St. Paul's Cathedral and Oxford Professor of Poetry, represents one of the earliest and most celebrated English verse translations of the Nala and Damayanti episode from the Mahabharata. First published in 1835, Milman's poetic rendering introduced Victorian audiences to one of Sanskrit literature's most beloved love stories, demonstrating that Indian epic narratives possessed emotional depth, moral complexity, and literary sophistication equal to classical Greek and Roman traditions. The tale of Nala and Damayanti stands as a complete narrative within the vast Mahabharata epic, often extracted and published independently due to its universal themes of love, devotion, loss, and redemption. The story follows King Nala of Nishadha, renowned for his virtue, beauty, and skill, and Princess Damayanti of Vidarbha, whose beauty attracts even the gods. Despite divine rivals for Damayanti's affection, the couple's love triumphs through a svayamvara (bride-choice ceremony) where Damayanti recognizes the true Nala among celestial imposters. However, their happiness proves short-lived when the demon Kali, seeking revenge, possesses Nala and drives him to gamble away his kingdom to his brother Pushkara. Exiled and destitute, Nala abandons Damayanti in the forest, believing she deserves better than his cursed presence. What follows is a profound exploration of separation, suffering, disguise, and reunion—Damayanti's unwavering devotion and clever stratagems eventually restore her husband, who has lived incognito as a charioteer, having lost even his physical form to Kali's curse. Through tests of loyalty, demonstrations of skill, and divine intervention, Nala regains his kingdom and his beloved wife. Milman, who taught himself Sanskrit with assistance from Professor H.H. Wilson, recognized this narrative's exceptional power. His translation employs elegant English verse forms—particularly narrative couplets and stanzas—that capture the emotional intensity while making the story accessible to readers unfamiliar with Indian traditions. The collection also includes translations of other Sanskrit episodes, showcasing the richness of ancient Indian poetry. Milman's work appeared during a period when British scholars and poets increasingly engaged with Sanskrit literature, following the pioneering translations of Sir William Jones. His version proved influential in establishing the Nala and Damayanti story within English literary consciousness, inspiring later adaptations and translations throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

Henry Hart Milman's *Nala and Damayanti, and Other Poems* (1835) represents a landmark moment in the English reception of Sanskrit epic literature, bringing the celebrated Mahabharata episode to British audiences through Romantic verse adaptation. Published by D.A. Talboys at Oxford, this work emerged at a pivotal juncture when Sanskrit studies were transitioning from specialized orientalist scholarship to wider literary appreciation, making Milman's translation the first separate English edition of this beloved narrative to reach the reading public.

## The Nala-Damayanti Episode

The Nala-Damayanti story, known in Sanskrit as the *Nalopakhyanam*, appears in the *Vana Parva* (Forest Book) of the Mahabharata, comprising approximately 1,100 double verses across twenty-six chapters. This self-contained narrative has long been regarded as one of the most enchanting episodes within the vast epic, exploring timeless themes of conjugal love, divine intervention, human fallibility, and ultimate redemption. The tale centers on Nala, the righteous king of Nishadha, renowned for his valor, wisdom, and exceptional skill in charioteering, and his beloved Damayanti, princess of Vidarbha, celebrated throughout the realm for her beauty and virtue.

The narrative unfolds through several movements: the lovers' initial separation, during which they fall in love through reported praise carried by a divine swan; Damayanti's swayamvara (self-choice ceremony), where she courageously identifies and chooses the true Nala from among gods who have assumed his form; their brief period of marital bliss; the catastrophic intervention of the demon Kali, who possesses Nala and causes him to lose his kingdom through dice-play to his brother Pushkara; the couple's painful separation in the wilderness; Nala's transformation and service as charioteer Bahuka to King Rituparna of Ayodhya; Damayanti's ingenious stratagem of announcing a second swayamvara to draw Nala back; their joyous reunion and mutual recognition; and finally, Nala's restoration to his throne and reconciliation with his repentant brother.

The episode's enduring appeal lies in its psychological depth and emotional resonance. Unlike many epic narratives that privilege martial valor, the Nala story centers on domestic virtue, spousal fidelity, and the power of unwavering love to overcome divine malice and mortal weakness. Damayanti emerges as an active agent rather than passive object, employing wit and determination to reunite with her husband. The tale's relatively simple Sanskrit and compelling narrative have made it the traditional introduction to Mahabharata study in Western universities, a pedagogical practice extending back to Milman's era.

## Romantic-Era Sanskrit Reception

Milman's 1835 translation appeared during the second wave of European engagement with Sanskrit literature, following the pioneering generation of orientalist scholars. Sir William Jones (1746-1794), who founded the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1784, initiated serious Sanskrit studies in the West, producing influential translations including *Sacontala* (1789) and *The Laws of Manu* (1794). Charles Wilkins had published the first English Bhagavad-Gita in 1785 under East India Company patronage. These early translations sparked extraordinary enthusiasm among German Romantic intellectuals: Friedrich Schlegel learned Sanskrit during Alexander Hamilton's imprisonment in Paris beginning in 1802, publishing his influential *Über die Sprache und Weisheit der Indier* (*On the Language and Wisdom of India*) in 1808, which established Sanskrit studies in Germany.

By the 1830s, Sanskrit's reception had evolved from purely philological interest toward literary appreciation and poetic adaptation. Horace Hayman Wilson, elected the first Boden Professor of Sanskrit at Oxford in 1832, published his introduction to the Mahabharata with translations of three extracts, though not a complete rendering. Wilson's Sanskrit-English Dictionary (1819) and his ongoing work on the Vishnu Purana provided crucial scholarly infrastructure. The Mahabharata itself had been translated into English only a year before Milman's work, making his focused treatment of the Nala episode effectively the first portion of the epic to achieve wide circulation among English readers.

This period witnessed complex dynamics within orientalist discourse. While British administrators like Thomas Babington Macaulay advocated for English education in India, dismissing Sanskrit literature's value, scholars and poets recognized its profound literary merit. The Romantic fascination with Sanskrit combined genuine appreciation for its aesthetic achievements with problematic notions of Aryan racial kinship and the search for Indo-European linguistic roots. Milman's translation participated in this cultural moment, rendering Sanskrit epic accessible through familiar English verse forms while acknowledging the original's alterity through extensive mythological and critical notes.

## Milman's Career and Literary Achievement

Henry Hart Milman (1791-1868) occupied a distinguished position in nineteenth-century British intellectual life, combining scholarly achievement with ecclesiastical advancement and sustained poetic production. Born in London as the third son of Sir Francis Milman, physician to King George III, Milman enjoyed advantages of birth that facilitated his brilliant university career. At Brasenose College, Oxford, he won the Newdigate Prize for poetry in 1812 with "Apollo Belvidere" and secured the English Essay Prize in 1816 with his "Comparative Estimate of Sculpture and Painting." Elected Fellow of Brasenose in 1814 and ordained in 1816, he served as parish priest of St. Mary's, Reading, from 1818.

Milman's appointment as Professor of Poetry at Oxford (1821-1831) coincided with the period when he developed his interest in Sanskrit literature and Eastern subjects. This professorship, dating from 1708, required the holder to deliver annual lectures on poetic theory and practice, providing Milman an institutional platform for his literary scholarship. His poetic oeuvre combined dramatic works, religious verse, and translations. His tragedy *Fazio* (1815), produced on stage as *The Italian Wife*, demonstrated theatrical ambitions, while *The Fall of Jerusalem* (1820) and *The Martyr of Antioch* (1822) established his reputation for religious-historical verse. The latter work later inspired Arthur Sullivan's sacred musical drama.

The *Nala and Damayanti* translation emerged during Milman's Oxford professorship, representing his most sustained engagement with non-European literary traditions. The work's subtitle—"Translated from the Sanskrit into English verse, with Mythological and Critical Notes"—signals his dual commitment to poetic adaptation and scholarly contextualization. His collected *Poetical Works* appeared in three volumes in 1839, consolidating his literary reputation. Subsequently, Milman's career shifted toward ecclesiastical administration and historical scholarship. Sir Robert Peel appointed him Rector of St. Margaret's, Westminster, and Canon of Westminster in 1835; in 1849 he became Dean of St. Paul's Cathedral, London, where he served until his death. His later historical works, including *History of the Jews* (1829) and *History of Latin Christianity* (1855), demonstrated the scholarly rigor that also informed his Sanskrit translation.

## Translation Approach and Textual Practice

Milman's approach to translating the *Nalopakhyanam* exemplifies Romantic-era translation theory, which valued poetic effect and cultural adaptation over strict literalism. He rendered the Sanskrit slokas (couplets in anushtubh meter) into English verse featuring a distinctive caesura-marked line structure. Rather than attempting to replicate Sanskrit metrical patterns, Milman employed flexible English verse with medial breaks, creating lines such as "Having gained the pearl of women—the majestic lord of earth" and "In his joy the elated monarch—shining radiant as the sun." This approach prioritized rhythmic flow and English poetic idiom while maintaining narrative fidelity to the Sanskrit original.

The work's extensive notes reveal Milman's scholarly apparatus and pedagogical intentions. His mythological annotations glossed Hindu deities, cosmological concepts, and cultural practices unfamiliar to British readers, while critical notes addressed textual variants, interpretive challenges, and connections to other Sanskrit literature. This paratext functioned both as scholarly apparatus and as cultural translation, mediating between Sanskrit literary conventions and British reading expectations. The notes reflect contemporary orientalist scholarship's dual impulses: genuine engagement with Sanskrit textual traditions and the filtering of that material through European intellectual frameworks.

Milman's translation achieved sufficient scholarly respect that Monier Williams incorporated it into his 1860 edition of the *Nalopakhyanam* alongside the Sanskrit text and vocabulary, describing his version as "an improved version of Dean Milman's translation." This pedagogical edition established the Nala story as standard introductory material for Sanskrit students, a practice continuing into the twentieth century. The longevity of Milman's translation suggests that despite inevitable limitations, it successfully conveyed the original's narrative power and emotional depth to English-speaking audiences.

The work's significance extends beyond its immediate literary merit to its role in shaping British perceptions of Indian civilization during the colonial period. By presenting a Sanskrit text emphasizing conjugal fidelity, moral virtue, and refined sentiment, Milman's translation complicated reductive orientalist stereotypes while still operating within orientalist frameworks. The very act of rendering the Mahabharata episode in polished English verse asserted its status as legitimate literature worthy of serious aesthetic attention, challenging dismissive attitudes toward Sanskrit textual traditions.
