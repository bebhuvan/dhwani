        Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan's "An Idealist View of Life" (1932), published by George Allen & Unwin following delivery as the prestigious Hibbert Lectures at University of Manchester (December 1929) and University College London (January 1930), supplemented by material from Principal Miller Lectures at Madras University (February 1931) and Third Krishnarajendra Silver Jubilee Lecture at Mysore University (October 1930), represents his most systematic philosophical articulation of idealist metaphysics integrating Vedantic non-dualism, Western idealist traditions (particularly British neo-Hegelians and American pragmatists), modern scientific worldviews, and mystical epistemology to defend spiritual reality's primacy against materialist reductions while demonstrating compatibility between religious intuition and rational-empirical inquiry..

## About This Work

Radhakrishnan argues that idealism—understanding reality as fundamentally mental/spiritual rather than material—best accommodates modern scientific knowledge, addresses perennial philosophical problems, validates religious experience across traditions, and provides coherent foundations for ethics and meaning. The Hibbert Trust's endowment supports lectures promoting "rational investigation" of religious and theological questions, positioning Radhakrishnan's defense of spiritual idealism within intellectual context valuing rational justification over faith-based dogmatism. His approach synthesizes Vedantic philosophy emphasizing consciousness as ultimate reality (Brahman), British idealism's critiques of materialism and empiricism, religious mysticism's claims about direct intuitive knowledge transcending conceptual-linguistic mediation, and pragmatist epistemology valuing consequences and lived experience over abstract logical analysis. The work remains significant for understanding mid-twentieth-century religious philosophy, neo-Vedantic engagement with Western philosophical traditions, and efforts demonstrating spiritual worldviews' rational defensibility amid scientific-secular challenges to religious belief.


## Hibbert Lectures and Philosophical Context

The Hibbert Lectures, established by Robert Hibbert's 1847 bequest to promote "rational investigation" of religious questions, represented one of Britain's most prestigious philosophical-theological lecture series, with previous speakers including Ernst Renan, Friedrich Max Müller, and William James. Radhakrishnan's 1929 selection as Hibbert Lecturer marked recognition of his philosophical authority and positioned him to address British academic audiences on idealism's viability amid early twentieth-century philosophical developments including logical positivism, scientific naturalism, and pragmatism challenging traditional metaphysics and religious worldviews.

The work synthesizes Vedantic non-dualism with Western idealist philosophy, religious mysticism's epistemological claims, and pragmatist emphasis on experiential validation, arguing that idealism provides most coherent framework for accommodating modern scientific knowledge while defending spiritual reality and religious experience's validity. Radhakrishnan addresses consciousness-matter relationships, arguing materialist reductions fail to explain subjective experience, intentionality, and normative values; scientific method's limitations regarding ultimate metaphysical questions; and mystical intuition as valid epistemological source complementing rational-empirical inquiry.
