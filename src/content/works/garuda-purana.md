description: "The Garuda Purana stands among the eighteen Mahapuranas as a distinctive Vaishnavite text addressing cosmology, theology, and especially death, afterlife, and funeral practices. Composed between 8th-11th centuries CE (with core material likely around 900 CE), this work of approximately 19,000 verses structured in two parts presents: Purva Khanda covering standard Puranic topics including creation cosmology, Vishnu avatara narratives, sacred geography, gemology, Ayurvedic medicine, and dharmic teachings; and the famous Preta Khanda (also called Pretakalpa) providing detailed descriptions of post-death journey, judgment before Yama (death god), various hells and their torments, karmic consequences, funeral ritual requirements, and ancestor worship (shraddha) protocols. Narrated as dialogue between Vishnu (in his Garuda vahana/vehicle form as eagle deity) and Garuda himself, the text uniquely emphasizes eschatological concerns alongside standard Puranic material. The Garuda Purana's Preta Khanda section became standard reference for Hindu death rituals, funeral practices, and ancestor worship, traditionally recited during the thirteen-day mourning period following death. The text's influence on Hindu conceptions of afterlife, karma-rebirth mechanics, and proper treatment of deceased proves foundational, establishing ritual and theological frameworks that continue shaping Hindu death practices across sectarian and regional boundaries."
