  William Carey's 1826 Bengali dictionary represents the first comprehensive English-Bengali lexicon, containing approximately 40,000-50,000 entries compiled over three decades at the Serampore Mission Press. The work includes extensive grammatical notes, etymological discussions drawing from Sanskrit roots, and Bengali-to-English and English-to-Bengali sections. It systematized Bengali orthography and provided the foundation for subsequent lexicographic work in the language, reflecting early 19th-century linguistic methodology and the role of mission presses in Bengali language standardization.

## Historical Context and Publication

William Carey published *A Dictionary of the Bengali Language* in 1826 through the Serampore Mission Press, culminating nearly three decades of linguistic work that began with his arrival in Bengal in 1793. The dictionary emerged from Carey's efforts to translate the Bible into Bengali and his broader missionary educational program, which required systematic documentation of Bengali vocabulary and grammar. This work built upon earlier fragmentary wordlists and Nathaniel Brassey Halhed's *A Grammar of the Bengal Language* (1778), but far exceeded them in scope and detail. The Serampore Mission Press, established by Carey and his colleagues Joshua Marshman and William Ward in 1800, became the institutional foundation for this lexicographic enterprise, producing the first modern printed Bengali dictionaries and grammars.

The 1826 edition represented a substantial revision and expansion of Carey's earlier 1815-1818 dictionary, incorporating additional entries, refined definitions, and improved organizational structure. Carey worked with a team of Bengali pandits, including Mrityunjay Vidyalankar, whose collaboration proved essential for understanding classical Sanskrit roots and contemporary Bengali usage patterns.

## Content and Structure

The dictionary contains an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 Bengali entries with English definitions, making it the most comprehensive lexicon of its time. The work is organized in two main sections: Bengali-to-English and English-to-Bengali. Carey employed Bengali script throughout, establishing orthographic conventions that influenced subsequent printing practices. Each entry typically includes the headword in Bengali, its English definition, grammatical classification, and often etymological notes tracing Sanskrit or other linguistic origins.

Carey paid particular attention to grammatical terminology, verb conjugations, and the distinction between tatsama (Sanskrit-derived) and tadbhava (colloquial Bengali) vocabulary. The dictionary includes technical terminology from various domains: religious concepts from Hindu, Muslim, and Christian traditions; administrative and legal terms from Mughal and early colonial governance; botanical and zoological nomenclature; and everyday vocabulary from Bengali social life. Carey's treatment of compound words and idiomatic expressions demonstrated his understanding of Bengali as a living language rather than merely a classical derivative of Sanskrit.

## Significance and Impact

This dictionary established the foundational framework for Bengali lexicography and remained the standard reference work throughout the 19th century. Carey's systematization of Bengali orthography influenced the development of modern printed Bengali and provided templates for subsequent dictionaries by Bengali scholars. The work facilitated the expansion of Bengali prose literature by providing a standardized vocabulary resource for writers during the Bengal Renaissance period.

The dictionary's dual function as both a scholarly linguistic resource and a practical tool for colonial administration and missionary work shaped its reception. While it enabled English officials to learn Bengali and supported evangelical translation projects, it simultaneously contributed to the standardization and preservation of Bengali as a literary language. Later Bengali lexicographers, including Jnanendramohan Das and Haricharan Bandyopadhyay, acknowledged their debt to Carey's pioneering work while developing more comprehensive and culturally grounded dictionaries.

## Author and Background

William Carey (1761-1834) arrived in Bengal as a Baptist missionary but became primarily known for his contributions to Indian linguistics and education. Beyond his dictionary work, Carey produced grammars of Bengali, Sanskrit, Marathi, and other Indian languages, translated the Bible into Bengali and portions into numerous other languages, and taught Bengali, Sanskrit, and Marathi at Fort William College in Calcutta from 1801 to 1830. His linguistic methodology combined European philological approaches with intensive study under Indian scholars, creating a hybrid framework that characterized early colonial-era language documentation. Despite his missionary motivations, Carey's linguistic works provided tools that Bengali intellectuals would later employ in developing modern Bengali literature and asserting cultural autonomy.
