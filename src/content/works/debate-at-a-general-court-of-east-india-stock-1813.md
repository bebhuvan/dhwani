# A debate at a general court of proprietors of East-India stock (14 March 1813)

## Why this matters

Before Parliament renewed the Company’s charter in 1813, Lord Castlereagh asked the proprietors gathered at Leadenhall Street to respond to his reform resolutions. This transcript records speeches by directors, shipowners, private traders, and evangelical shareholders as they weighed opening Indian ports to British merchants, permitting missionaries, and reshaping Company finances.

## What's inside

The debate sets out Castlereagh’s resolutions verbatim, then follows the four-hour session speaker by speaker. Directors such as William Astell defend the Company’s administrative role while negotiating concessions on private trade; merchants from Liverpool and Glasgow demand freer access to Bengal; naval officers highlight employment for Indiamen; and supporters of the Church Missionary Society plead for religious liberty. Amendments, divisions, and procedural motions are reproduced in full, offering a rare look at corporate parliamentary culture.

## Historical setting

The ensuing Charter Act ended the Company’s monopoly on trade with India (except tea and the China trade), paved the way for missionary work under licence, and tightened Crown oversight via the Board of Control. These minutes reveal the anxieties behind those reforms—concerns about revenue, shipping jobs, and the balance between imperial governance and commercial interests during the Napoleonic Wars.

## Research notes

Because the clerk captured interruptions and points of order, historians can reconstruct alliances among proprietors and see how metropolitan campaigners—evangelicals, merchants, shipbuilders—used the general court to lobby Parliament. The document also summarises petitions submitted by provincial chambers of commerce, enabling cross-reference with Parliamentary Papers (1812–1813) and the evidence collected by the House of Commons Committees on East Indian affairs.
