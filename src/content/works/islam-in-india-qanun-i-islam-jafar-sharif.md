# Islam in India, or The Qānūn-i Islām

## Overview

The *Qānūn-i Islām* ("The Customs of Islam") is a detailed ethnographic account of Islamic life in 19th-century India. Written by Ja'far Sharīf, an Indian Muslim scholar, and translated by G.A. Herklots, the work documents Muslim religious practices, social customs, and daily life across the Indian subcontinent.

Unlike theological treatises or historical chronicles, Sharīf's work captures *lived religion*—the blend of orthodox Islamic practices, Sufi mystical traditions, Persian cultural influences, and indigenous Indian customs. The work covers every stage of Muslim life, from birth ceremonies and childhood education through marriage rituals and festive celebrations to death rites and mourning practices.

Originally published in Urdu and translated into English by Herklots in 1832 (with the 1921 revised edition), the *Qānūn-i Islām* became a reference for British colonial administrators, scholars studying comparative religion and South Asian culture, and later generations seeking to understand traditional Islamic life in India before modern transformations.

Sharīf writes as an insider, documenting his community's practices with both appreciation and critical distance. The work preserves knowledge of practices that later declined under colonialism, modern education, and reform movements, offering insight into the syncretic Indo-Islamic culture foundational to understanding Muslim identity in South Asia.

## About the Author and Translator

### Ja'far Sharīf (ca. 1800s)

**Background**: Little is known of Sharīf's personal biography, but internal evidence suggests he was an educated Muslim, likely from a scholarly family, with connections to traditional Islamic learning and Persian cultural traditions. His intimate knowledge of practices across different social classes indicates wide social observation.

**Scholarly Approach**: Sharīf combined participant observation with critical distance, systematically covering lifecycle stages and social practices while appreciating regional variations and class differences. His precise descriptions of rituals, material culture, and social customs provide valuable ethnographic detail.

**Religious Position**: Sharīf appears to have been a relatively orthodox Sunni Muslim with Sufi sympathies, critical of some folk practices he considered superstitious while appreciating mystical traditions. His work reveals the tension between scriptural Islam and popular practices incorporating pre-Islamic and Hindu elements.

### G.A. Herklots

**Career**: Gerhard Andreas Herklots served as a medical missionary and surgeon in India during the early 19th century. His medical practice brought him into contact with Indian Muslim communities.

**Translation Work**: Herklots' 1832 English translation made Sharīf's Urdu original accessible to Western audiences. His annotations added medical observations, comparative notes on Hindu customs, historical context, Islamic legal background, Persian and Arabic terminology explanations, and critical comments from a Christian missionary perspective.

**Subsequent Editions**: The work went through multiple editions (1832, 1863, 1921), each updating and expanding annotations, reflecting evolving scholarly and colonial interests in Indian Muslim society.

## Historical and Cultural Context

### Islam in 19th-Century India

**Historical Development**: Islam arrived in India through Arab traders (7th-8th centuries), Turkic and Afghan conquests (11th-16th centuries) bringing Persian Islamic culture, the Mughal Empire (1526-1857), and continued conversion, especially among lower castes.

**Regional Diversity**: By the 19th century, Indian Muslims exhibited linguistic diversity (Urdu, Bengali, Tamil, Gujarati), sectarian differences (Sunni majority, significant Shia communities in Lucknow and Deccan), varied cultural practices (Mughal courtly traditions, regional folk practices, Sufi mystical orders), and social stratification from aristocratic ashraf families to indigenous converts maintaining local customs.

**Syncretic Character**: Centuries of interaction with Hindu majority culture produced distinctive features: shrine culture (dargahs) incorporating pilgrimage practices, folk beliefs blending Islamic and Hindu cosmologies, musical traditions (qawwali), architectural fusion in mosques and tombs, and shared festivals.

### Colonial Period Context

**British Rule**: The work was written during the transition from Mughal to British imperial rule, marked by decline of Muslim political power after the 1857 Rebellion, economic displacement of the traditional Muslim elite, introduction of Western education, and colonial ethnographic interest in categorizing subject populations.

**Orientalist Scholarship**: European scholars produced translations of classical Islamic texts, ethnographic documentation, legal codifications of Muslim personal law, and comparative religious studies.

**Reform Movements**: The 19th century saw emergence of reform movements including the Deobandi school (emphasizing scriptural orthodoxy), Ahl-i Hadith (rejecting folk practices and Sufi innovations), modernist movements like Aligarh (adapting to Western education), and continuing Sufi orders maintaining popular devotional practices.

Sharīf's work documents traditional practices just as reform movements began challenging them, preserving knowledge of a religious culture undergoing transformation.

## Significance and Impact

### Ethnographic Value

The *Qānūn-i Islām* preserves detailed knowledge of practices that have since declined under modernization, reformed through urbanization and education, or been suppressed by puritanical reform ideologies. Unlike European travelers' external observations, Sharīf provides insider understanding of meanings practitioners attached to rituals, internal diversity within Muslim communities, class and regional variations, and gender-specific practices often hidden from male European observers.

### Colonial Administration

Colonial administrators used the work to understand Muslim personal law and customs, navigate social and religious sensitivities, and inform policy. However, colonial appropriation sometimes essentialized diverse communities, used knowledge for social control, reinforced communal categories, and failed to recognize the dynamic nature of practices.

### Scholarly Impact

The work contributed to understanding Islamic diversity globally, comparative study of religious adaptation and syncretism, theories of folk Islam versus scriptural orthodoxy, and study of religion as lived practice. It remains an essential source for pre-modern Muslim social history, Hindu-Muslim cultural interaction, gender studies, and material culture research.

### Contemporary Relevance

The work preserves memory of traditions older generations remember but younger may not practice, providing historical depth to contemporary practices and documenting pre-Partition shared cultural space. Some communities use Sharīf's documentation to revive forgotten traditions, claim authentic historical practices, and resist homogenizing reform movements.

## Critical Perspectives

### Strengths

The work offers unmatched detail across the full range of Islamic lifecycle and annual practices, written by a Muslim scholar documenting his own community's traditions. It provides rich ethnographic attention to material culture, regional variations, and class differences, preserving knowledge of practices since transformed or disappeared.

### Limitations

Despite coverage of women's practices, the work reflects a male viewpoint with limited access to female spaces. Sharīf's education suggests an upper-class perspective on lower-class practices. Occasional judgments about "superstitious" or "un-Islamic" practices reveal his particular religious viewpoint. The work primarily focuses on northern Indian (especially Mughal heartland) practices with less coverage of regional variations, and tends to present practices as timeless rather than historically evolving.

### Source Criticism

Herklots' Christian missionary perspective sometimes colors annotations, requiring critical reading to distinguish Sharīf's voice from the translator's additions. Multiple editions with different editorial apparatus require attention to which version is being consulted. Where possible, the work should be corroborated with Persian and Urdu sources, contemporary travelers' accounts, later ethnographic studies, and oral histories from practitioners.

## This Digital Edition

### Preservation Significance

The Internet Archive's 1921 edition digitization provides global access to this rare ethnographic document, preserving knowledge about Indo-Islamic traditions endangered by modernization, enabling comparative research with other ethnographic accounts and contemporary practices, and allowing students to engage with primary sources in religious studies and South Asian history.

### Research Applications

The digital format enables textual analysis (searching for specific practices, terms, or concepts), comparative studies (analyzing how Islamic practices in India relate to other regional traditions), historical research on 19th-century Muslim social life, and anthropological baseline documentation for studying continuity and change in contemporary Muslim communities.

## How to Access

Available through the Internet Archive (University of Toronto collection), this work is in the public domain and freely accessible. The 1921 edition includes updated annotations and editorial apparatus reflecting early 20th-century scholarship.

The *Qānūn-i Islām* offers a window into traditional Indian Islam—a religious culture authentically Islamic yet distinctively Indian, shaped by centuries of cultural exchange and adaptation. Through Ja'far Sharīf's documentation, we see a religious tradition balancing scriptural orthodoxy with local customs, formal theology with folk beliefs, universal Islamic identity with particular Indian expression—a tradition that, while transformed, continues shaping Muslim life in South Asia today.
