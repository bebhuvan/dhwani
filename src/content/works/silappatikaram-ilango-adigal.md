description: "The Silappatikaram stands as Tamil literature's supreme epic and one of five great Tamil kavyas, narrating Kannagi's tragic story through three cantos exploring love, injustice, and divine retribution. Composed around 5th century CE by Jain prince-turned-ascetic Ilango Adigal, this masterwork of approximately 5,730 lines follows merchant Kovalan's marriage to virtuous Kannagi, his infatuation with courtesan Madhavi, financial ruin, attempted redemption through selling Kannagi's ankle bracelet, false accusation of theft, unjust execution, and Kannagi's rage destroying Madurai city. Beyond narrative, the epic presents comprehensive portrait of ancient Tamil civilization: detailed descriptions of three capitals (Puhar, Madurai, Vanji), festivals, music, dance, commerce, justice systems, and religious pluralism (Hindu, Buddhist, Jain traditions coexisting). The work's literary excellence appears in vivid characterization, emotional intensity, elaborate descriptions, and philosophical depth addressing karma, dharma, and fate. The Silappatikaram influenced Tamil culture profoundly as literary masterpiece, cultural encyclopedia, and moral exemplar, inspiring countless adaptations while demonstrating Tamil epic poetry's sophistication rivaling Sanskrit mahakavyas."
