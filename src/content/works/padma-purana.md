description: "The Padma Purana ranks among the largest of eighteen Mahapuranas, comprising approximately 55,000 verses across five sections (khandas), presenting encyclopedic coverage of Hindu cosmology, mythology, sacred geography, and devotional theology. Composed between 12th-15th centuries CE (with core material likely around 1200 CE), this massive Vaishnavite work contains: Srishti Khanda covering creation cosmology, divine genealogies, and avatara narratives; Bhumi Khanda presenting extensive sacred geography including pilgrimage sites (tirthas), river sanctity, and regional temple traditions; Svarga Khanda describing celestial realms, heavenly rewards for virtuous conduct, and festival observances; Brahma Khanda addressing duties across varnas (castes) and ashramas (life stages), alongside detailed vrata (vow) descriptions; and Uttara Khanda featuring complete Ramayana retelling emphasizing devotional dimensions alongside discussions of yoga, dharma, and liberation theology. The Padma Purana distinctively emphasizes bhakti (devotion) as supreme path to moksha, extensive pilgrimage site glorification establishing pan-Indian sacred geography, and sectarian passages asserting Vishnu's supremacy while respecting Shiva and Devi. The text's massive scope and regional variations reflect centuries of accretion and transmission across diverse communities. The Padma Purana's influence on temple traditions, pilgrimage culture, festival observances, and vernacular religious literature proves extensive, establishing mythological and ritual frameworks that continue shaping Hindu devotional practice and theological understanding."
