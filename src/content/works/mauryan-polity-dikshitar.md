# Mauryan Polity

## Overview

V.R. Ramachandra Dikshitar's *Mauryan Polity* (1932) provides comprehensive analysis of Mauryan Empire's (322-185 BCE) political organization and administrative systems. Published by University of Madras, the work synthesizes literary sources (Arthashastra, Megasthenes), epigraphic evidence (Ashokan edicts), and archaeological findings to reconstruct governance structures of India's first large-scale unified state.

## About the Author

V.R. Ramachandra Dikshitar (1896-1953), distinguished Indian historian and Sanskrit scholar, Professor of Indian History and Archaeology at University of Madras. Authored numerous works on ancient Indian culture, administration, and warfare. Pioneer in applying rigorous source criticism to ancient Indian history.

## The Mauryan Empire

Founded by Chandragupta Maurya (r. 322-297 BCE) with Kautilya's guidance, empire expanded under Bindusara (r. 297-273 BCE), peaked under Ashoka (r. 268-232 BCE), controlling most of Indian subcontinent from Afghanistan to Mysore. Capital: Pataliputra (modern Patna). Declined post-185 BCE under later rulers.

## Political Organization

Central Administration: King (supreme authority), mantriparishad (ministerial council), amatyas (civil servants), purohita (royal priest), senapati (commander-in-chief). Provincial Structure: Provinces (janapadas) governed by royal princes or appointed governors, districts, villages. Bureaucracy: Hierarchical system documented in Arthashastra—adhyakshas (superintendents) for specific departments (treasury, commerce, mints, agriculture, forests, mines).

## Key Systems

Revenue: Land tax (bhaga), customs duties, fines, state monopolies (salt, mines, forests). Military: Standing army (infantry, cavalry, chariots, elephants—Megasthenes reports 600,000 infantry, 30,000 cavalry, 9,000 elephants), fortifications. Judiciary: King as supreme judge, dharma courts, local village councils. Espionage: Extensive intelligence network (spies, informants) documented in Arthashastra. Urban Administration: Municipal boards (Megasthenes describes Pataliputra's six committees).

## Ashoka's Dhamma

Ashoka's dhamma (moral law) policy: Religious tolerance, non-violence (ahimsa), social welfare, animal protection, environmental conservation. Implemented through dhamma-mahamatras (morality officials), rock and pillar edicts, state-supported social programs. Represented shift from Arthashastra's realpolitik to ethical governance.

## Significance

Documented ancient India's sophisticated centralized administration, compared Kautilyan political theory with actual practice, analyzed relationship between power and ethics in governance, provided evidence for pre-modern bureaucratic state structures, illustrated administrative continuities with later Indian empires.
