# Short Report of Hindu Mahasabha Relief Activities During 'Calcutta Killing' and 'Noakhali Carnage'

## Overview

This historically significant report documents the relief activities undertaken by the Hindu Mahasabha during two of the most devastating episodes of communal violence in pre-partition India: the Direct Action Day riots in Calcutta (August 1946) and the subsequent Noakhali riots (October-November 1946). Published in 1946, this 58-page document provides a crucial firsthand account of humanitarian efforts during a period of unprecedented communal tension that directly preceded the partition of India.

## Historical Context

The report emerges from one of the most turbulent periods in modern Indian history. The year 1946 marked a critical juncture in Indian politics, with various political parties and organizations positioning themselves for the anticipated transfer of power from British rule. The Muslim League's call for "Direct Action Day" on August 16, 1946, was intended as a peaceful demonstration to demand the creation of Pakistan, but in Calcutta it devolved into horrific communal violence.

The Direct Action Day riots, later termed the "Great Calcutta Killings," resulted in an estimated 4,000-5,000 deaths with thousands more injured, tens of thousands displaced, widespread destruction, and complete breakdown of civic order. Following the Calcutta riots, communal violence spread to other parts of Bengal, with Noakhali district experiencing systematic attacks on Hindu communities, forced conversions, and widespread displacement over several weeks.

## About the Hindu Mahasabha

The **Hindu Mahasabha** was a Hindu nationalist political organization founded in 1915, led by prominent figures like Vinayak Damodar Savarkar and Syama Prasad Mookerjee. The organization advocated for Hindu political unity, opposed the partition of India on religious lines, and maintained relief committees and volunteer networks that could be mobilized during emergencies.

## Content and Documentation

The report provides detailed accounts of the Hindu Mahasabha's relief efforts during both crisis periods, including immediate response measures (provision of food, water, medical aid, shelter arrangements, and security coordination), organizational structure (relief committees, volunteer mobilization, resource collection), and statistical documentation of casualties, displacement, property damage, and relief distribution.

As a contemporary document, the report preserves first-hand observations from relief workers, victim testimonies, administrative challenges, and community responses to the crisis.

## Historical Significance and Limitations

This report serves as a crucial primary source for understanding contemporary perspectives on the crisis, political context, social dynamics, and administrative challenges. However, as an organizational report, it must be understood within its specific context, reflecting the Hindu Mahasabha's political and ideological perspective during the highly charged atmosphere preceding partition.

The events documented in this report played a crucial role in accelerating the partition of India, causing increased communal polarization, influencing British decisions about independence timelines, and affecting major political leaders' positions while drawing international attention to India's communal situation.

## Research Value

This document serves multiple research purposes as essential source material for partition studies, communal violence research, political history, and social history. It provides important data for comparative analysis with modern disaster response methods, political organization studies, and understanding patterns of inter-community conflict and cooperation.

The report offers valuable educational content for understanding the complex events leading to partition, the importance of inter-community relations, crisis response approaches, and political leadership during crises.

## Contemporary Relevance

Modern researchers and policymakers can use this document for learning about conflict prevention, community response coordination, inter-community understanding, and political responsibility during crises. The work supports research in political science (political mobilization and crisis management), sociology and anthropology (community responses and social networks), and policy research (disaster management and communal harmony).

Available through digital archives, this report remains a crucial primary source for understanding one of the most tragic periods in modern Indian history, providing insights into communal conflict, political mobilization, and humanitarian response during the final years of British rule.
