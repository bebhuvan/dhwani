# Wahrhaftige ausfuhrliche Beschreibung der Ostindischen Kusten

## Overview
First printed in Amsterdam, Baldaeus’s richly illustrated folio compiles first-hand reports from his years with the Dutch East India Company. The narrative blends missionary perspectives, military encounters with the Portuguese, and meticulous descriptions of Hindu and Buddhist ritual practices observed across coastal South India and Sri Lanka.

## Highlights
The volume includes fold-out maps, costume studies, temple drawings, and an extended critique of local religions based on interviews with Brahmins and other scholars. Baldaeus documents the turbulent transition from Portuguese to Dutch control, recording sieges, maritime engagements, and the mercantile logic that drove European competition in the Indian Ocean.

## Access Notes
The University of California Libraries scan offers high-resolution page images that preserve copperplate engravings and dual-column Gothic type. Researchers can download the full facsimile in PDF or consult individual image files to study iconography and marginal annotations characteristic of seventeenth-century travel literature.
