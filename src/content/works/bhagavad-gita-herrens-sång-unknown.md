  Here's the expanded description:
  
  The Bhagavad-Gita: Herrens Sång represents a foundational Swedish translation of one of the most significant philosophical and spiritual texts in the Sanskrit literary canon, originating from the ancient Indian epic Mahabharata. Composed approximately between 400 BCE and 200 CE, this philosophical discourse occurs within a narrative framework of a dialogue between Prince Arjuna and Lord Krishna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, exploring profound metaphysical, ethical, and existential questions. This particular 1900 Swedish translation contributes to the broader European scholarly engagement with Indian philosophical traditions during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when Western intellectual circles were increasingly exploring Eastern philosophical and religious texts. The work explores fundamental concepts of dharma (moral duty), karma (action and consequence), and moksha (spiritual liberation), presenting a sophisticated philosophical framework that integrates contemplative wisdom with practical ethical conduct. Krishna's teachings emphasize the importance of detached action, spiritual self-realization, and transcendence of ego-driven motivations, representing a nuanced synthesis of metaphysical inquiry and practical life guidance. As a seminal text in Hindu philosophy, the Bhagavad-Gita has profoundly influenced Indian intellectual and spiritual thought, offering insights into the complex relationship between individual consciousness, cosmic order, and spiritual practice. This Swedish translation signifies an important moment in cross-cultural philosophical transmission, making these sophisticated Indian philosophical concepts accessible to Nordic scholarly and cultural audiences during a period of increasing global intellectual exchange.

# Bhagavad-Gita: Herrens Sång

## Description

This Swedish translation renders the Bhagavad-Gita—the famous philosophical poem embedded in the Mahabharata epic—into accessible Nordic verse, preserving the spiritual teachings between Prince Arjuna and Lord Krishna. The text addresses core Hindu philosophical concepts including dharma (duty), detachment, and the eternal nature of the soul. Translated into Swedish, it makes Indian philosophical wisdom available to Scandinavian audiences.

## Central Philosophical Dialogue

The work opens on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, where Arjuna confronts devastating doubt about the morality of warfare against his own relatives. Krishna's teachings unfold as a comprehensive philosophical response, addressing action, renunciation, devotion, and knowledge—the multiple paths to spiritual realization. The dialogue format allows exploration of competing perspectives on ethics and spirituality.

## Religious and Philosophical Significance

The Gita presents systematic approaches to spiritual liberation through different temperamental types and paths. Krishna's teachings reconcile action with detachment, arguing that righteous duty performed without attachment to results constitutes spiritually valid practice. The text remains central to Hindu spiritual philosophy and has influenced global religious thought.
