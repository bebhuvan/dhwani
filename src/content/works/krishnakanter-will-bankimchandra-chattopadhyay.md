# Krishnakanter Will

## Overview

Published in 1878, *Krishnakanter Will* (কৃষ্ণকান্তের উইল) is Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay's social novel centered on inheritance, family obligation, and moral choices in colonial Bengal. Unlike his historical romances (*Durgeshnandini*, *Anandamath*), this work examines contemporary Bengali society through the story of Krishnakanta's will and its consequences for his family and dependents.

## Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay (1838-1894)

Bengal Renaissance's major novelist who established Bengali prose fiction as serious literary form. Best known for *Anandamath* (1882) containing "Vande Mataram," the nationalist hymn. His fourteen novels include historical romances, social fiction, and philosophical works. Trained as lawyer and served as British deputy magistrate while writing fiction critically examining Bengali society under colonial transformation.

## The Novel

**Plot Framework:** Krishnakanta, wealthy landlord, drafts a will dividing his estate. The document's provisions and the characters' reactions reveal moral failings, hidden desires, and social hypocrisies. The inheritance becomes lens examining relationships between family members, servants, and dependents.

**Thematic Focus:**
- Property and moral corruption
- Family duty versus self-interest
- Class relations in Bengali household
- Women's limited legal and social position
- Hypocrisy underlying respectable society

**Narrative Technique:** Bankim employs psychological realism, showing characters' internal struggles and rationalizations. The omniscient narrator occasionally addresses readers directly, commenting on actions and motivations.

## Literary Significance

This work demonstrates Bankim's range beyond historical romance. Where novels like *Durgeshnandini* dramatize historical periods, *Krishnakanter Will* dissects contemporary social reality. The domestic setting and inheritance plot allow examination of everyday moral compromises rather than heroic action.

Bankim's social novels influenced subsequent Bengali realist fiction, particularly Saratchandra Chattopadhyay's family dramas. The attention to psychological motivation and social detail anticipated 20th-century Bengali social realism.

## Language and Style

Written in Bankim's mature prose style: clear syntax, balanced sentences, precise diction drawing on both Sanskrit and colloquial Bengali. Unlike his historical novels' elevated register, this work employs language closer to educated Bengali speech, appropriate for contemporary social setting.

## Historical Context

The novel appeared during debates about Hindu inheritance law, women's property rights, and family structure under British legal modernization. Bengali *bhadralok* (genteel class) were negotiating between traditional joint family structures and emergent nuclear family patterns. Bankim's plot examines tensions within this transition.
