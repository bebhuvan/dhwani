# Art of India: Traditions of Indian Sculpture, Painting and Architecture

## Overview

Stella Kramrisch's *Art of India* (1954) represents a landmark synthesis of Indian artistic traditions by the 20th century's preeminent scholar of Indian art. Published by Phaidon Press in 242 pages, this comprehensive survey examines sculpture, painting, and architecture from ancient times through the modern period, interpreting Indian art through indigenous philosophical, religious, and aesthetic frameworks rather than imposing Western categories.

## The Author: Stella Kramrisch

Stella Kramrisch (1896-1993) transformed Western understanding of Indian art through seven decades of scholarship:

### Biography and Career

**Origins:** Born in Austria, educated at the University of Vienna

**Early India Years:** Invited by Rabindranath Tagore to teach at Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan (1922-1924)

**Calcutta University:** Professor of Indian Art at Calcutta University (1924-1950)

**University of Pennsylvania:** Taught at University of Pennsylvania's South Asia Studies program

**Padma Bhushan:** Awarded India's third-highest civilian honor (1970)

### Scholarly Approach

Kramrisch pioneered methods that became standard in Indian art history:

**Textual Integration:** Systematically related art to Sanskrit texts on aesthetics, iconography, and ritual

**Religious Context:** Understood art as inseparable from Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain religious practice

**Iconographic Analysis:** Decoded symbolic meanings through śāstric (textual) sources

**Phenomenological Interpretation:** Emphasized experiencing art on its own cultural terms

**Artistic Agency:** Treated Indian artists as sophisticated creative agents, not anonymous craftsmen

## Structure and Content

While the precise chapter structure varies by edition, the work typically covers:

### Ancient and Classical Period

**Indus Valley Civilization:** Proto-historic art and its enigmatic symbolism

**Mauryan Art:** Asokan pillars, stupas, and early Buddhist monuments

**Early Buddhist Art:** Sanchi, Bharhut, Amaravati - narrative relief sculpture

**Gandhara and Mathura:** Contrasting Buddhist sculptural styles

**Gupta Period:** Classical synthesis in sculpture and architecture

### Medieval Period

**Temple Architecture:** Development of Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara styles

**Hindu Sculpture:** Iconographic programs in Shiva, Vishnu, and Devi temples

**Cave Temples:** Ellora, Elephanta, Badami - rock-cut architecture

**Regional Schools:** Distinctive traditions in different parts of India

### Painting Traditions

**Ajanta Murals:** Buddhist narrative painting at its finest

**Manuscript Illumination:** Jain and Buddhist painted manuscripts

**Rajput Painting:** Regional schools and their distinctive aesthetics

**Mughal Miniatures:** Persian-influenced court painting

**Temple Painting:** Mural traditions in Hindu temples

### Architecture

**Stupa Architecture:** Evolution from simple mounds to elaborate monuments

**Temple Architecture:** Typology, symbolism, and regional variations

**Islamic Architecture:** Mosques, tombs, and Indo-Islamic synthesis

**Palace Architecture:** Secular royal architecture

## Theoretical Framework

Kramrisch's interpretation rested on several key concepts:

### Hindu Aesthetics

**Rasa Theory:** Emotional experience as art's purpose

**Dhvani:** Suggestion and resonance in artistic expression

**Alankara:** Ornamentation as essential, not decorative

**Sadrishya:** Resemblance to divine forms, not naturalistic imitation

### Religious Meaning

**Darshan:** Art as vehicle for divine vision

**Yantra and Mandala:** Geometric symbolism underlying form

**Iconometry:** Mathematical proportions deriving from sacred texts

**Ritual Function:** Art's role in worship and spiritual practice

### Historical Development

**Continuity:** Underlying aesthetic principles persist despite stylistic change

**Regional Diversity:** Indian art's plurality within shared foundations

**Cultural Synthesis:** Assimilation of foreign elements (Greek, Persian) into Indian idiom

**Living Tradition:** Connection between ancient and contemporary practice

## Major Themes

### The Hindu Temple

Kramrisch devoted particular attention to temple architecture:

**Cosmic Mountain:** Temple as architectural representation of Mount Meru

**Divine Dwelling:** Temple as literal house of the deity

**Structural Symbolism:** Every element carrying symbolic meaning

**Ritual Space:** Architecture shaping devotional experience

### Iconography

Systematic interpretation of divine imagery:

**Attributes:** Weapons, ornaments, vehicles identifying deities

**Mudras:** Hand gestures conveying meaning

**Vahanas:** Animal vehicles symbolizing divine qualities

**Attendant Figures:** Composite divine assemblages

### Sculptural Aesthetics

Understanding what makes sculpture "Indian":

**Three-Dimensionality:** Roundness and volume as essential qualities

**Movement:** Dynamic poses suggesting cosmic dance

**Multiplicity:** Many arms/heads representing divine powers

**Sensuality:** Idealized bodies embodying fertility and prosperity

## Significance and Impact

### Academic Influence

**Methodology:** Established textual-contextual approach as standard

**Training:** Influenced generations of art historians through teaching

**Publications:** Her numerous works became standard references

**Museum Practice:** Shaped how Indian art is displayed and interpreted

### Broader Cultural Impact

**Western Understanding:** Made Indian art intelligible to non-specialist Western audiences

**Indian Self-Awareness:** Helped Indians reconnect with their artistic heritage

**Decolonization of Interpretation:** Moved beyond colonial frameworks emphasizing "decline"

**Contemporary Artists:** Influenced modern Indian artists seeking traditional roots

## Comparison with Other Art Historical Approaches

### Colonial-Era Scholarship

**James Fergusson (1808-1886):** Focused on chronology and style, less on meaning

**E.B. Havell (1861-1934):** Emphasized spirituality but sometimes romanticized

**A.K. Coomaraswamy (1877-1947):** Philosophical but perhaps overly abstract

**Kramrisch's Innovation:** Balanced scholarship with interpretive depth

### Contemporary Approaches

**Vidya Dehejia:** Narrative analysis in Buddhist art

**Michael Meister:** Architectural analysis and regional styles

**Susan Huntington:** Buddhist iconography and symbolism

**Kramrisch's Legacy:** All build on foundations she established

## The 1954 Edition

Published by Phaidon Press, known for high-quality art books:

**Format:** 242 pages with illustrations

**Visual Material:** Photographs and drawings of artworks

**Accessibility:** Written for educated general readers, not just specialists

**Production Quality:** Phaidon's reputation for excellent reproduction

## Later Developments

Kramrisch continued developing her ideas in subsequent works:

*The Hindu Temple* (1946): Monumental study of temple architecture and symbolism

*Indian Sculpture* (1933): Earlier comprehensive survey

*The Presence of Siva* (1981): Iconographic and philosophical study

*Painted Delight* (1986): Indian miniature painting

**Foundational Reference:** Essential starting point for studying Indian art

**Methodological Model:** Demonstrates how to interpret art within cultural context

**Historical Document:** Shows mid-20th-century art historical thinking
