# Indian Currency and Finance

## Overview

*Indian Currency and Finance* (1913) is John Maynard Keynes's first major published work, establishing his reputation as an expert on international monetary systems. Written based on his experience as a civil service clerk at the India Office (1906-1908) and subsequent lectures at the London School of Economics and Cambridge, the book examines India's adoption of the gold-exchange standard and argues for its superiority even over Britain's gold specie standard.

## Historical Context

### Keynes at the India Office (1906-1908)

After completing his studies at Cambridge, Keynes worked at the India Office from October 1906 to June 1908, initially in the Military Department and then in the Revenue, Statistics and Trade Department. This position gave him firsthand experience with British monetary policy in India, particularly the management of the rupee-sterling exchange rate and India's transition from silver to gold-backed currency.

### The Currency Question

In 1893, India began transitioning from a silver standard to a gold-exchange standard, fixing the rupee-sterling exchange rate at 1 shilling 4 pence to the rupee (£1 = ₹15) from 1899-1914. This system allowed India to maintain currency stability without holding large quantities of gold domestically, instead holding sterling reserves in London.

## Content and Arguments

### The Gold-Exchange Standard

Keynes defended India's gold-exchange standard as "the best currency system then existing in the world," superior even to Britain's traditional gold standard. He analyzed how this system:

- Maintained stable exchange rates between the rupee and pound sterling
- Minimized the need for expensive gold holdings in India
- Enabled government management of reserves for currency convertibility
- Supported paper currency expansion while maintaining confidence

### Key Topics Covered

1. **Evolution from Silver to Gold-Exchange** (post-1893)
2. **Reserve Management**: Two types of reserves—for converting local to international currency and vice versa
3. **Paper vs. Metallic Currency**: Advantages of paper currency in reducing costs
4. **The Rupee-Sterling Rate**: Analysis of the fixed rate at £1:₹15
5. **Monetary Expansion**: How India's money supply increased 43% between 1903-1907 while prices rose 40%
6. **Banking System**: Strengths and weaknesses of India's financial institutions
7. **Proposal for Central Bank**: Advocating for creation of what would become the State Bank of India

### Critical Perspective

Modern scholarship notes Keynes's work both defended British monetary imperialism while inadvertently documenting policies that favored British over Indian interests. His technical analysis of the gold-exchange standard, however, proved influential in shaping international monetary theory.

## Impact and Legacy

Published in June 1913 by Macmillan and Co., London, the book's success led to Keynes's appointment—at age 30—to the Royal Commission on Indian Finance and Currency (1913-1914) while the work was still in press. This marked the beginning of his influential career in international monetary policy, eventually leading to his role in designing the Bretton Woods system after World War II.

The book established the gold-exchange standard as the predominant form of international gold standard before World War I and influenced colonial monetary policy across the British Empire.

## Scholarly Significance

*Indian Currency and Finance* represents a crucial document in both the history of economic thought and colonial financial policy. It demonstrates how colonial administrators shaped monetary systems to serve imperial interests while contributing to broader debates about international finance, reserve management, and the relative merits of different currency standards. The work remains valuable for understanding both Keynesian economic thought and the financial architecture of British India.
