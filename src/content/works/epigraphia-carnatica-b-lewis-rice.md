# Epigraphia Carnatica

## Overview

*Epigraphia Carnatica* represents one of India's most comprehensive regional epigraphic surveys, documenting over 9,000 inscriptions from Karnataka (the Carnatica or Kanarese-speaking region). Initiated by Benjamin Lewis Rice in the late 19th century under Mysore State's patronage, this multi-volume series systematically recorded, transcribed, translated, and analyzed stone and copper-plate inscriptions spanning fourteen centuries (5th-19th centuries CE), transforming Karnataka's historical understanding from vague legend to detailed chronological framework.

The project's significance extends beyond regional history. These inscriptions—found on temple walls, hero-stones, memorial pillars, in caves, and on copper plates—provide primary source documentation for medieval Indian political, social, economic, religious, and linguistic history. They record dynastic genealogies, land grants, temple endowments, trade regulations, irrigation projects, caste organizations, and literary achievements, offering unparalleled insight into how Indian society actually functioned at local and regional levels.

Rice's meticulous methodology—photographing or making facsimiles, providing accurate transliterations, translating into English, adding historical commentary, and creating comprehensive indices—established standards for epigraphic publication still followed today. The work preserved rapidly deteriorating inscriptions while making their contents accessible to scholars worldwide.

## About B. Lewis Rice (1837-1927)

Benjamin Lewis Rice served as Director of Public Instruction in Mysore State (1884-1908), but his lasting impact came through archaeological and epigraphic work. Fluent in Kannada and Sanskrit, Rice combined administrative position with passionate interest in Karnataka's history and culture.

Beyond *Epigraphia Carnatica*, Rice authored *Mysore: A Gazetteer* and numerous studies on Karnataka's dynasties, inscriptions, and cultural heritage. His work was enabled by Mysore Maharajas' enlightened support for historical research and cultural preservation—unusual for a princely state under British paramountcy.

Rice's approach balanced scholarly rigor with practical accessibility. Recognizing that inscriptions' historical value required making their contents available beyond specialists, he emphasized clear translations and historical context rather than purely technical philological analysis.

## Scope and Organization

The series is organized geographically by districts of Mysore State (now Karnataka):

**Volume Structure**: Each volume covers specific districts or taluks, with inscriptions numbered sequentially. Volume 4 (digitized here), for example, covers specific regions with detailed documentation of their epigraphic wealth.

**Chronological Range**: Earliest inscriptions from Ganga dynasty (5th century CE) through Hoysala, Vijayanagara, and into colonial period (19th century).

**Languages**: Primarily Kannada and Sanskrit, with some Tamil and Telugu inscriptions in border regions.

**Types**: Temple inscriptions, hero-stones (*vīragal*), memorial stones (*nisidhi*), copper-plate land grants, cave inscriptions, pillar edicts.

## Historical Importance

### Dynastic Histories

Inscriptions provided the only reliable sources for reconstructing dynastic chronologies and political histories of:

**Gangas of Talakad** (4th-11th centuries): Early Karnataka dynasty whose inscriptions established Karnataka's political geography.

**Rashtrakutas** (8th-10th centuries): Powerful Deccan empire ruling from Manyakheta.

**Chalukyas**: Both early Chalukyas of Badami and later Chalukyas of Kalyani.

**Hoysalas** (11th-14th centuries): Builders of spectacular temples at Belur, Halebid, Somnathpur.

**Vijayanagara Empire** (14th-17th centuries): Last great Hindu empire whose inscriptions document administrative sophistication.

### Social and Economic History

Inscriptions illuminate aspects rarely preserved in literary sources:

**Land Tenure**: Detailed records of land grants (*brahmadeya*, *agrahara*) showing agrarian organization and religious endowments.

**Irrigation**: Tank construction, canal digging, water management systems.

**Trade**: Merchant guild organizations (*nanadesi*, *ayyavole*), trading regulations, commercial networks.

**Caste**: Professional castes, artisan guilds, social hierarchies, occupational organizations.

**Gender**: Women donors, queens as administrators, female property rights.

**Village Governance**: Local assemblies (*sabha*, *ur*), dispute resolution, community organization.

### Religious History

Temple inscriptions document:

**Construction**: Founding dates, patron identities, architectural details, building costs.

**Endowments**: Land grants supporting worship, festivals, feeding programs (*anna-santarpana*).

**Sectarian Developments**: Shifts between Shaivism, Vaishnavism, Jainism showing religious patronage patterns.

**Basadi (Jain temple) Records**: Particularly rich for understanding Karnataka's strong Jain tradition.

### Linguistic Evidence

Kannada inscriptions trace the language's literary development:

**Early Kannada**: Evolution from 5th-century proto-Kannada through classical Kannada.

**Literary References**: Mentions of lost Kannada literary works, poet patronage, literary achievements.

**Linguistic Features**: Phonological and grammatical changes over centuries.

**Multilingualism**: Code-switching between Kannada and Sanskrit showing linguistic interaction.

## Methodological Contribution

Rice's epigraphic methodology established standards:

**Documentation**: Photographs or estampages (ink impressions) preserving visual record.

**Transliteration**: Accurate rendering in Roman script enabling wider scholarly access.

**Translation**: English translations making content accessible to non-Kannada/Sanskrit readers.

**Historical Commentary**: Contextualizing inscriptions within broader historical framework.

**Paleographic Analysis**: Dating undated inscriptions through script evolution.

**Indices**: Comprehensive indices of personal names, place names, technical terms enabling research.

## Impact on Historical Studies

*Epigraphia Carnatica* revolutionized Karnataka and Deccan history:

**Chronological Framework**: Established firm dates for dynasties previously known only through legend.

**Local History**: Enabled detailed reconstruction of regional and local histories.

**Art History**: Dated temple construction enabling stylistic chronologies for Deccan architecture and sculpture.

**Economic History**: Provided data on land tenure, irrigation, trade, taxation rarely available in literary sources.

**Social History**: Illuminated caste organizations, gender roles, occupational structures.

## Modern Use

Contemporary historians, archaeologists, art historians, and epigraphers continue using *Epigraphia Carnatica*:

**Source Citation**: Standard reference for Karnataka inscriptions.

**Archaeological Surveys**: Identifying and dating monuments.

**Heritage Conservation**: Documenting rapidly deteriorating inscriptions.

**Regional History**: Essential source for local and regional historical research.

**Linguistic Studies**: Data for studying Kannada language evolution.

## Preservation Challenges

Many inscriptions Rice documented have since deteriorated, been defaced, or disappeared—making his records the only surviving evidence. Urban development, temple renovations, and environmental damage continue threatening surviving inscriptions, increasing *Epigraphia Carnatica*'s documentary importance.

## This Digital Edition

Internet Archive's digitization makes this rare, expensive multi-volume series freely accessible worldwide. Researchers no longer need access to specialized libraries to consult these fundamental sources for Karnataka and Deccan history.

## How to Access

Free download from Internet Archive (University of Toronto collection). Volume 4 (digitized here) is one of multiple volumes covering different regions. Each volume functions as independent reference for its geographic area while contributing to comprehensive regional documentation.
