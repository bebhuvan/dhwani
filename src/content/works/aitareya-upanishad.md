description: "The Aitareya Upanishad presents Vedantic philosophy through cosmological creation narrative and consciousness analysis, establishing the famous mahavakya 'Prajnanam Brahma' (Consciousness is Brahman)—one of four great Vedantic statements identifying ultimate reality with pure awareness. Composed around 6th century BCE, this brief text of three chapters belongs to the Aitareya Aranyaka of the Rigveda and narrates how Atman (Self) created universe, entered creation as individual consciousness, and remains discoverable through self-inquiry. The text's creation account demonstrates sophisticated cosmology: primordial Self generates waters, person (purusha), worlds, deities, and finally enters creation through skull opening, declaring 'I am this' at birth—establishing consciousness's primacy over material elements. The philosophical climax identifies consciousness (prajna) as Brahman, asserting awareness as ultimate reality rather than emergent property of matter. This teaching profoundly influenced Vedantic epistemology, Buddhist consciousness philosophy, and contemporary philosophy of mind debates about consciousness's nature, while establishing Rigvedic contribution to Upanishadic philosophy alongside more numerous Yajurveda and Samaveda texts."
