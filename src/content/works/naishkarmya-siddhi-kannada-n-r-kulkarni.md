  This 1936 Kannada translation of Sureshvaracharya's Naishkarmya Siddhi, rendered by N.R. Kulkarni and published by Shreishivaananda Mandira, represents significant vernacularization of classical Advaita Vedanta philosophical literature, making the sophisticated arguments of this eighth-century foundational text accessible to Kannada-reading audiences. The Naishkarmya Siddhi ("Establishment of Non-Action" or "Perfection of Actionlessness") comprises 423 verses across four chapters and stands among the four most important texts in the siddhi-literature tradition of Advaita Vedanta, alongside Brahma-siddhi of Mandana Misra, Advaita-siddhi of Madhusudana Sarasvati, and Ishta-siddhi of Vimuktatman. Composed by Sureshvaracharya, one of Adi Shankara's four principal disciples and first pontiff of the Sringeri Sharada Peetham, the text systematically establishes the central Advaita thesis that liberation (moksha) is achieved exclusively through self-knowledge (atma-jnana) rather than ritual action (karma), developing this argument through progressive examination of ignorance as bondage's source, discrimination between Self and not-self, analysis of the mahavakya "tat tvam asi" ("That thou art"), and synthesis grounded in canonical Advaita scriptures. This 519-page Kannada rendering, published during the 1930s when vernacular philosophical literature was expanding in Karnataka, served multiple functions: enabling Kannada-speaking students and practitioners to engage directly with Advaita texts without Sanskrit prerequisite; contributing to Karnataka's intellectual culture by demonstrating Kannada's capacity for sophisticated philosophical discourse; and participating in broader twentieth-century movements vernacularizing classical Indian philosophical traditions across regional languages. The translation appeared during period when Karnataka's Smartha Brahmin communities, traditionally adherents of Adi Shankaracharya's Advaita philosophy and followers of the Sringeri Sharada Peetham, were negotiating relationships between Sanskrit textual authority and vernacular accessibility, between traditional learning and modern education, and between hereditary scholarly lineages and emerging public intellectual culture. Kulkarni's translation work exemplified scholarly bridging function—maintaining fidelity to Sanskrit original's philosophical precision while rendering complex arguments in accessible Kannada prose, enabling text's integration into Kannada educational and devotional contexts. The publication by Shreishivaananda Mandira, an institution dedicated to spiritual and philosophical literature dissemination, indicates the work's positioning within religious-intellectual infrastructure supporting Advaita study and practice in Karnataka. As Kannada translation of text by Sringeri Peetham's founding pontiff, the work held particular significance for Karnataka's Advaita communities, providing vernacular access to authoritative philosophical exposition by figure of exceptional lineage importance.

# ನೈಷ್ಕರ್ಮ್ಯ ಸಿದ್ಧಿ (Naishkarmya Siddhi) - Kannada Translation

## Overview

N.R. Kulkarni's 1936 Kannada translation of Sureshvaracharya's *Naishkarmya Siddhi*, published by Shreishivaananda Mandira, participated in the significant twentieth-century project of vernacularizing classical Indian philosophical literature, making sophisticated Advaita Vedanta texts accessible to regional-language audiences while demonstrating vernacular languages' capacity for rigorous philosophical discourse. This 519-page rendering transformed an eighth-century Sanskrit philosophical treatise—composed in highly technical terminology and employing complex argumentative structures characteristic of classical Indian philosophy—into Kannada prose that preserved conceptual precision while enabling comprehension by readers lacking advanced Sanskrit training.

The original *Naishkarmya Siddhi* ("Establishment of Non-Action" or "Perfection of Actionlessness") holds exceptional status within Advaita Vedanta tradition. Comprising 423 verses organized across four chapters, it stands among the four canonical texts of siddhi-literature—the genre systematically establishing Advaita positions through rigorous argumentation against rival philosophical schools. Composed by Sureshvaracharya, one of Adi Shankara's four principal disciples and the first pontiff (Peethadhipati) of the Sringeri Sharada Peetham—one of the four cardinal monasteries established by Shankara—the text carries particular authority within the Advaita lineage. Unlike Sureshvaracharya's vartikas (metrical sub-commentaries) explicating Shankara's Upanishad commentaries, the *Naishkarmya Siddhi* constitutes independent philosophical exposition presenting Advaita's essential doctrines with systematic clarity.

The work's publication in 1936 situated it within multiple converging contexts: the expanding vernacular philosophical literature across Indian regional languages during the late colonial and early independence periods; Karnataka's particular intellectual culture combining traditional Sanskrit learning with modern educational institutions; and Advaita Vedanta's ongoing vitality as living philosophical and spiritual tradition requiring accessible texts for contemporary practitioners and students. The translation served Karnataka's Smartha Brahmin communities—traditional adherents of Shankaracharya's Advaita philosophy and Sringeri Peetham followers—while potentially reaching broader Kannada-reading audiences interested in Indian philosophy.

## The Original Text: Structure and Arguments

Sureshvaracharya's *Naishkarmya Siddhi* develops the central Advaita thesis through four progressive chapters, each addressing crucial philosophical questions and refuting rival positions.

**Chapter One** (100 verses) establishes the fundamental proposition that ignorance (avidya) of the Self's true nature constitutes bondage, and only knowledge (jnana) of the Self can liberate. This opening chapter directly challenges karma-oriented interpretations arguing that ritual action leads to liberation, instead demonstrating that action—being rooted in ignorance and producing further karmic consequences—cannot destroy ignorance but only perpetuates bondage. The argument distinguishes between empirical actions within conventional reality (vyavaharika) and the absolute reality (paramarthika) of pure consciousness (atman) untouched by action. This theoretical foundation establishes the entire subsequent argumentation.

**Chapter Two** (119 verses) addresses the critical epistemological problem of discriminating Self from not-self, particularly distinguishing pure consciousness from the mind (manas/buddhi). This discrimination proves essential because ordinary experience conflates the Self with mental states, bodily sensations, and individual personality. The chapter analyzes how this misidentification occurs, examines the mind's nature as instrument rather than subject of experience, and establishes the Self's nature as eternal, unchanging witness-consciousness distinct from all objective phenomena including internal mental states.

**Chapter Three** (126 verses) investigates ignorance's nature, locus, and content—fundamental questions for explaining how the non-dual absolute appears as multiplicitous empirical world. The chapter includes detailed analysis of the mahavakya "tat tvam asi" ("That thou art")—among the Upanishads' principal statements directly teaching non-dual identity of individual self (tvam) with absolute reality (tat). Sureshvaracharya examines this statement's grammatical structure, apparent contradictions, and correct interpretation, demonstrating how proper understanding dissolves seeming differences between finite individual and infinite absolute, revealing their non-dual identity.

**Chapter Four** (78 verses) synthesizes preceding arguments while grounding them in authoritative Advaita texts, particularly Shankara's *Upadesa Sahasri* and Gaudapada's *Mandukya-karika*. This concluding chapter demonstrates the *Naishkarmya Siddhi*'s positions' consistency with established Advaita tradition, provides scriptural validation through Upanishadic citations, and addresses remaining objections. The synthesis establishes the work within the authoritative Advaita lineage while asserting Sureshvaracharya's independent philosophical contributions.

## Translation Context: Vernacularization and Accessibility

The 1936 publication occurred during significant period in Karnataka intellectual history. The University of Mysore, established 1916, was developing as center for both Sanskrit traditional learning and modern scholarly research. Institutions like the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute in Pune were producing critical editions of classical texts. The Ramakrishna Mission and other organizations were disseminating Advaita Vedanta through publications and lectures in vernacular languages. Within this context, Kannada translations of classical philosophical texts served multiple functions.

Vernacular philosophical literature enabled students in modern educational institutions—where Sanskrit instruction was declining—to engage classical Indian thought. It supported Advaita study within religious communities and monasteries where practitioners sought accessible expositions of foundational texts. It demonstrated regional languages' philosophical capacity, countering assumptions that sophisticated abstract thought required Sanskrit or European languages. And it participated in cultural-nationalist projects asserting indigenous intellectual traditions' continuing vitality and contemporary relevance.

The translator N.R. Kulkarni, though less documented than some prominent scholarly figures of the period, undertook demanding intellectual labor requiring deep command of both Sanskrit philosophical terminology and Kannada expository prose. Philosophical translation presents particular challenges: technical terms often lack precise vernacular equivalents; arguments depend on subtle distinctions requiring careful rendering; and conceptual frameworks embedded in Sanskrit grammar and etymology require creative solutions in grammatically different target languages. Successful philosophical translation balances fidelity to original meanings with target-language clarity and naturalness.

The publisher, Shreishivaananda Mandira, functioned within the religious-intellectual infrastructure supporting Advaita study. Such institutions—combining aspects of traditional monasteries, modern publishing houses, and educational organizations—played crucial roles in maintaining classical traditions while adapting to modern contexts. Their publication activities ensured continued circulation of authoritative texts in formats accessible to contemporary audiences.

## Significance for Karnataka Advaita Tradition

For Karnataka's Advaita communities, this translation held particular significance beyond general vernacularization benefits. The Sringeri Sharada Peetham, established by Adi Shankara in Karnataka and continuously functioning since the eighth century, serves as primary spiritual and intellectual authority for Smartha Brahmins across South India, particularly in Karnataka. Sureshvaracharya, as Sringeri's founding pontiff, holds exceptional status within this lineage. His *Naishkarmya Siddhi* thus represents not merely important philosophical text but work by figure of direct lineage connection to Shankara himself.

The availability of this text in Kannada enabled Karnataka's Advaita practitioners to engage their own tradition's foundational literature in their mother tongue, strengthening connections between regional identity and philosophical-spiritual tradition. It supported traditional learning within families and communities where Sanskrit knowledge was declining among younger generations. And it facilitated integration of classical Advaita study with modern Kannada literary and intellectual culture.

The translation also documented Kannada's philosophical vocabulary at specific historical moment, preserving terminological choices and expository strategies for rendering complex Vedantic concepts in vernacular idiom. For historians of Kannada language and intellectual culture, such texts provide evidence of how philosophical discourse developed in regional-language contexts, showing which Sanskrit terms were borrowed directly, which received Kannada equivalents, and how abstract argumentation was structured in Kannada prose.

## Preservation and Contemporary Accessibility

The text's digitization through the Digital Library of India initiative and availability via Internet Archive ensures continued access to this mid-1930s Kannada philosophical translation. For contemporary researchers, the digitized work enables studies in multiple directions: comparative analysis with other Kannada philosophical translations from the period; examination of vernacularization strategies and philosophical terminology development; investigation of religious publishing and intellectual networks in 1930s Karnataka; and tracing how classical Advaita texts were received and interpreted in regional contexts.

For Kannada-speaking students and practitioners of Advaita Vedanta, the digitized translation provides historical resource documenting earlier approaches to rendering these classical texts in vernacular language, potentially informing contemporary translation projects or serving as accessible introduction to Sureshvaracharya's thought for those with limited Sanskrit competence.

The work also contributes to documentation of Shreishivaananda Mandira's publication activities and the broader landscape of religious-philosophical publishing in early twentieth-century Karnataka, aspects of regional intellectual history that remain insufficiently studied despite their significance for understanding how traditional learning and modern print culture intersected.
