description: "Mirabai's bhajans (devotional songs) represent medieval India's most powerful voice of female bhakti, transgressing social boundaries through ecstatic Krishna devotion. Born into Rajput royalty (c. 1498-1547), Meerabai rejected palace life, widowhood conventions, and caste restrictions to wander as a Krishna devotee, composing passionate songs in Rajasthani-Hindi-Gujarati vernaculars. Her approximately 1,200-1,300 surviving padas (lyric poems) employ direct, intimate language addressing Krishna as beloved (priyatam), expressing madhurya bhava (sweet devotional love) with unprecedented female agency. Defying attempts at poison and social ostracism, Mirabai established paradigms for women's spiritual autonomy within patriarchal contexts. Her songs—blending folk meters with sophisticated bhakti theology, personal anguish with mystical joy—became foundational to North Indian devotional music traditions. Performed continuously in temples, homes, and public gatherings across linguistic regions, Mirabai's poetry remains vital to understanding bhakti's liberatory potential, vernacular literary development, and women's religious authority in medieval and modern India."
