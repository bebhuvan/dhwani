title: Twenty-Two Goblins. Translated from the Sanskrit
author:
- Unknown
year: 1900
language:
- English
genre:
- Classical Literature
description: 'This English translation presents twenty-two tales from the Sanskrit
  Vetala Panchavimshati (Twenty-Five Tales of the Vampire), offering an alternative
  rendering to Burton''s more famous version. The frame narrative centers on King
  Vikramaditya''s attempt to capture a vetala (a spirit that inhabits corpses) from
  a cremation ground, with each capture triggering a tale ending in a moral riddle.
  The vetala declares it will remain with the king only if he maintains silence; when
  Vikram inevitably answers the riddle (compelled by righteous duty to speak truth),
  the corpse flies back to the tree, forcing repetition of the entire process. This
  narrative structure—common to Indian and Middle Eastern frame tales—creates a sophisticated
  meditation on kingship, justice, dharma (righteous duty), and the relationship between
  speech, silence, and wisdom. The tales themselves present intricate moral puzzles
  often involving family duty, sexual transgression, caste boundaries, and the limits
  of human judgment, requiring Vikram (and by extension the reader) to navigate competing
  ethical claims without clear resolution. Unlike Burton''s heavily annotated and
  orientalized version, this translation attempts more direct rendering of the Sanskrit
  material, though scholarly consensus holds that no "pure" English version exists—all
  translations necessarily interpret the text through cultural and linguistic frameworks
  that transform its meaning. The work exemplifies classical Sanskrit narrative literature''s
  characteristic features: embedding philosophical discourse within entertaining stories,
  using frame narratives to organize diverse materials, and privileging moral ambiguity
  over didactic certainty, inviting readers into active ethical reasoning rather than
  passive reception of doctrine.

## Historical Context

The Vetala Panchavimshati, from which "Twenty-Two Goblins" is translated, emerges from a rich narrative tradition of Sanskrit storytelling during the classical period of Indian literature, roughly spanning 300-1200 CE. This era was characterized by significant cultural and intellectual flowering across the Indian subcontinent, particularly in kingdoms like the Gupta Empire (320-550 CE) and subsequent regional dynasties.

The work belongs to the broad genre of katha literature—narrative collections that blended entertainment with moral and philosophical instruction. Such collections were crucial in transmitting cultural knowledge, ethical frameworks, and philosophical concepts across generations and social strata. The vetala (vampire-like spirit) narrative specifically reflects a sophisticated storytelling tradition that uses supernatural frames to explore complex human dilemmas.

During this period, Sanskrit was not merely a literary language but a sophisticated medium of intellectual discourse, used across religious, philosophical, legal, and narrative domains. The narrative's exploration of dharma (righteous duty) and ethical complexity mirrors the intellectual sophistication of classical Indian philosophical traditions, particularly those emerging from Brahmanical and Buddhist intellectual circles.

## About the Author

The original author of the Vetala Panchavimshati remains unknown, a common characteristic of classical Indian literary works. Traditionally, such narratives were part of an oral storytelling tradition, with multiple authors and performers contributing to and transforming the text over generations.

While the specific author is unidentified, the work likely emerged from learned Brahmin storytellers and scholars who were professional custodians of narrative and philosophical knowledge. These individuals played crucial roles in medieval Indian intellectual life, preserving and transmitting cultural wisdom through sophisticated narrative techniques.

The anonymity of the text is itself significant, reflecting a cultural understanding of knowledge as collective and cumulative rather than individually owned—a philosophical approach fundamentally different from Western notions of individual authorship.

## Key Themes and Content

The narrative centers on King Vikramaditya's repeated attempts to capture a vetala, with each capture triggering a complex moral tale. These stories are not simple moral fables but intricate explorations of ethical complexity, challenging readers to navigate nuanced human dilemmas.

Key thematic concerns include:
- The nature of judicial and personal ethics
- Tensions between individual desire and social duty
- Complexities of familial and romantic relationships
- Challenges of interpreting righteous action
- Intersections of personal choice and cosmic order

The tales frequently destabilize expected moral frameworks, presenting scenarios where conventional ethical judgments prove inadequate. This reflects a sophisticated philosophical approach that privileges moral reasoning over simplistic prescriptive morality.

## Significance

"Twenty-Two Goblins" represents a crucial text in understanding classical Indian narrative and philosophical traditions. Its significance extends beyond mere entertainment, offering profound insights into medieval Indian social, ethical, and philosophical conceptualizations.

The work exemplifies the Indian narrative tradition's capacity to embed complex philosophical discourse within engaging storytelling. Its influence can be traced in subsequent literary and philosophical developments, including Mughal-era narrative collections and contemporary Indian literary forms.

Moreover, the text provides crucial anthropological and cultural insights into medieval Indian social structures, gender relations, and ethical deliberations. Its nuanced approach to moral complexity continues to resonate with contemporary readers and scholars.

## Structure and Contents

The work follows a sophisticated frame narrative structure, where a supernatural vetala repeatedly challenges King Vikramaditya through intricate moral tales. Each story concludes with a challenging riddle, testing the king's wisdom and ethical discernment.

The twenty-two tales are not randomly assembled but carefully curated to create a complex meditation on human experience. They cover diverse scenarios—from royal intrigues to romantic complications, from familial conflicts to metaphysical challenges.

The narrative's cyclical structure, where the vetala returns to its original tree after each tale, creates a rhythmic philosophical exploration that mirrors broader Indian conceptualizations of cosmic cycles and recurring philosophical challenges.
