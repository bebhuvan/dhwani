# The Travels of Marco Polo: India Sections

## Overview

Marco Polo's travel account, dictated to Rustichello da Pisa in 1298 while imprisoned in Genoa, includes substantial descriptions of India based on information gathered during his return journey from China (1292-1295) and from merchants and travelers he encountered. The sections on India describe the Coromandel and Malabar coasts, the island of Ceylon (Sri Lanka), and the Andaman Islands, documenting trade goods (especially pearls and spices), political structures, religious practices, and social customs. Henry Yule's magisterial 1871 edition provides extensive annotations, maps, and commentary that contextualize Polo's observations within 13th-century geography, trade networks, and comparative travel literature.

## About Marco Polo

Marco Polo (1254-1324) was a Venetian merchant and traveler who spent 24 years traveling through Asia, including 17 years in service to Kublai Khan. His account, originally titled "Description of the World" (Divisament dou monde), became one of the most influential medieval travel narratives. While Polo did not personally visit most of mainland India, his descriptions of Indian coastal regions and islands drew from observations during his sea journey and from information provided by Indian Ocean merchants, making his account a valuable source for understanding 13th-century maritime trade and European knowledge of India.

## About Henry Yule

Sir Henry Yule (1820-1887) was a Scottish Orientalist, geographer, and translator who served in the Bengal Engineers. His annotated editions of medieval travel accounts, including Marco Polo and Cathay and the Way Thither, established standards for scholarly editing and geographical annotation. Yule's 1871 edition of Marco Polo, later revised by Henri Cordier, remains a fundamental reference work, combining translation, manuscript comparison, historical commentary, and geographical analysis.

## India in Marco Polo's Account

Polo's descriptions of India include:
- **Malabar Coast**: Pepper trade, local kingdoms, customs, and Muslim merchant communities
- **Coromandel Coast**: Pearl fishing, Hindu temples, marriage customs, and textile production
- **Ceylon (Sri Lanka)**: Adam's Peak, precious stones, Buddhist practices, and royal courts
- **Greater India**: Descriptions of Southeast Asian kingdoms showing Indian cultural influence
- **Andaman Islands**: Brief mention of indigenous peoples and maritime hazards

The accounts mix personal observation with second-hand information, requiring careful historical analysis to distinguish between Polo's direct experiences and reported knowledge.

## Historical and Geographic Significance

Polo's account influenced European geographical knowledge for centuries, appearing in mappae mundi and navigation charts. The descriptions of Indian spice trade, pearl fisheries, and textile production informed European commercial interests and later maritime exploration. Yule's annotations connect Polo's observations to other medieval sources, archaeological evidence, and contemporary 19th-century knowledge, making the edition valuable for both medieval studies and the history of geographical knowledge.

## Yule's Editorial Method

Yule's edition provides:
- Collation of multiple manuscript traditions
- Extensive footnotes identifying places, persons, and practices
- Comparative references to other medieval travelers (Ibn Battuta, Friar Odoric, etc.)
- Maps and illustrations
- Appendices on topics such as medieval geography and Asian trade

This scholarly apparatus transformed Polo's narrative into a comprehensive reference work on medieval Asian geography and trade.

## Digital Preservation

Yule's 1871 edition has been digitized from University of California and other libraries and is freely accessible through the Internet Archive, ensuring continued access to both Polo's medieval observations and Yule's 19th-century scholarship on Asian geography and travel literature.
