# The Indian Antiquary: A Journal of Oriental Research

## Overview

The Indian Antiquary stands as one of the most influential journals in the development of Indology as an academic discipline. Founded in 1872 by James Burgess CIE, this monthly periodical facilitated scholarly communication between European and India-based researchers across diverse fields—archaeology, epigraphy, ethnology, history, folklore, languages, literature, numismatics, philosophy, and religion—for over six decades until its cessation in 1933.

Volume 1, published in 1872, established the journal's high scholarly standards and commitment to original research. The journal's most distinctive contribution was its publication of high-quality lithographic and photographic reproductions of inscriptions, enabling scholars worldwide to work with accurate textual sources. Many epigraphic readings and translations first published in The Indian Antiquary remain authoritative references today, preserving decipherments of inscriptions that have since deteriorated.

Operating as a privately funded scholarly enterprise without institutional backing, The Indian Antiquary represented remarkable dedication to advancing knowledge. Contributors received no payment, editors worked without compensation, and the journal survived through subscription revenue and Burgess's personal commitment to scholarship over profit.

## Founder: James Burgess

**James Burgess** (1832-1916) was a Scottish archaeologist and antiquarian who dedicated his career to documenting India's architectural and epigraphic heritage. Arriving in India in 1855 as headmaster of Bhuj high school in Kutch, Burgess developed passionate interest in Indian archaeology, systematically surveying and documenting temples, caves, and inscriptions across western India.

Burgess's archaeological methodology combined careful observation, accurate measurement, photographic documentation, and epigraphic recording. His surveys of the cave temples at Ellora, Elephanta, and throughout Gujarat established standards for archaeological documentation. In 1874, Burgess became the first Director-General of the Archaeological Survey of India (Western Circle), formalizing his pioneering work.

Founding The Indian Antiquary in 1872 reflected Burgess's recognition that scattered scholars working in isolation needed a publication venue for sharing discoveries and collaborative research. The journal became the primary forum where archaeologists, epigraphists, linguists, and historians could publish findings, debate interpretations, and build collective knowledge about India's past.

Burgess edited the journal until 1884, when deteriorating eyesight forced him to transfer editorship to John Faithfull Fleet and Richard Carnac Temple. He continued contributing articles and supporting the journal until his death in 1916, maintaining lifelong commitment to advancing Indian archaeological and historical studies.

## The Journal's Mission and Scope

The Indian Antiquary's founding prospectus articulated ambitious goals:

**Comprehensive Coverage**: Rather than specializing narrowly, the journal embraced all aspects of Indian culture and history, recognizing the interconnections between archaeology, language, literature, religion, and social customs.

**Original Research**: Priority was given to publishing new discoveries—inscriptions, manuscripts, archaeological finds, ethnographic observations—rather than derivative scholarship.

**High Standards**: Submissions underwent editorial scrutiny for accuracy and scholarly rigor, establishing peer review practices.

**International Collaboration**: The journal welcomed contributions from scholars regardless of nationality, institutional affiliation, or geographic location, creating a truly international scholarly community.

**Accessibility**: By publishing in English and maintaining affordable subscription rates, the journal made Indian studies accessible beyond specialist circles.

**Documentation**: Particular emphasis on publishing primary sources—epigraphic texts, folklore collections, manuscript notices—that future scholars could reference.

## Editorial Philosophy and Practices

Burgess and his editorial successors maintained rigorous standards:

**Scholarly Accuracy**: Articles required documentary evidence, proper citation, and logical argumentation. Speculation was permitted but clearly distinguished from established facts.

**Primary Source Emphasis**: Original inscriptions, manuscripts, and archaeological data took precedence over secondhand accounts.

**Correction Culture**: The journal regularly published corrections to previous articles, fostering culture of scholarly honesty and continuous improvement.

**Debate and Discussion**: Scholars could respond to published articles, creating productive scholarly dialogue.

**Illustration Quality**: Unprecedented attention to producing accurate lithographs and photographs of inscriptions, recognizing that quality reproductions were essential for scholarly work.

**Prompt Publication**: Monthly schedule ensured timely dissemination of new discoveries.

## Contributors and Scholarly Community

The Indian Antiquary attracted contributions from the leading Indologists of its era:

- **Georg Bühler**: German Indologist contributing epigraphic studies
- **John Faithfull Fleet**: Epigraphist who later became editor, specializing in Sanskrit and Kannada inscriptions
- **Ramkrishna Gopal Bhandarkar**: Pioneering Indian scholar contributing linguistic and historical studies
- **Richard Carnac Temple**: Anthropologist and folklorist who co-edited the journal
- **Numerous Indian scholars**: Pandits, museum curators, and independent researchers whose contributions demonstrated indigenous scholarship

This international and culturally diverse contributor base created productive scholarly exchange transcending colonial divisions, though the journal inevitably reflected power dynamics of the colonial knowledge economy.

## Impact on Indology

The Indian Antiquary profoundly shaped Indology's development:

**Institutionalization**: Helped transform scattered amateur antiquarianism into professionalized academic discipline with standards and methodologies.

**Canon Formation**: Articles collectively defined which texts, inscriptions, and sites merited scholarly attention, shaping Indological canons.

**Methodological Development**: Published debates about epigraphy, dating methods, and historical interpretation advanced scholarly methods.

**Knowledge Infrastructure**: Created searchable archive of discoveries and interpretations that subsequent scholars built upon.

**Regional Studies**: Encouraged documentation of regional histories and cultures beyond pan-Indian Sanskrit traditions.

**Indigenous Scholarship**: Provided platform for Indian scholars, though editorial power remained primarily with Europeans.

## Colonial Context and Postcolonial Critique

The Indian Antiquary operated within colonial structures:

**Colonial Knowledge Production**: The journal served British imperial interests in understanding and governing India, though most contributors pursued knowledge for its own sake.

**Power Dynamics**: Editorial control, language choice (English), and interpretive frameworks reflected colonial power relations.

**Indigenous Knowledge**: While Indian scholars contributed significantly, European scholarly paradigms and languages often mediated indigenous knowledge.

**Preservation and Appropriation**: The journal preserved Indian heritage while simultaneously extracting and cataloging it for Western scholarship.

Postcolonial scholars recognize both the journal's contributions to preserving knowledge and its role in colonial knowledge systems. The tension between genuine scholarly dedication and colonial power structures characterizes much 19th-century oriental scholarship.

## Technical Innovations

The journal pioneered technical aspects:

**Photographic Documentation**: Early adoption of photography for recording inscriptions and monuments preserved evidence subsequently lost to weathering and human destruction.

**Lithographic Reproduction**: High-quality lithographs of inscriptions enabled scholars without access to original sites to work with accurate copies.

**Typographic Challenges**: Publishing texts in multiple scripts (Devanagari, Tamil, Telugu, etc.) required sophisticated typesetting capabilities.

**Indexing**: Comprehensive indices facilitated reference and cross-referencing across volumes.

## Later History and Cessation

After Burgess's editorship:

**John Faithfull Fleet** edited from 1884, maintaining high standards for epigraphic studies.

**Richard Carnac Temple** co-edited (1884-1914), particularly strengthening folklore and ethnographic content.

**Financial Challenges**: Operating without institutional support created ongoing funding difficulties.

**World War I Impact**: The war disrupted international scholarly communication and finances.

**Competition**: New specialized journals emerged, fragmenting the audience.

**Final Years**: The Royal Anthropological Institute assumed responsibility (1925-1932), but the journal ceased publication in 1933 with Volume 62, number 783.

## Legacy and Contemporary Use

Today The Indian Antiquary serves multiple purposes:

**Historical Research**: Essential source for studying 19th-century Indian history, as many inscriptions and sites it documented have since deteriorated or been destroyed.

**Epigraphic Reference**: Original readings and translations remain authoritative for scholars working with South Asian inscriptions.

**Folklore Studies**: Preserved oral traditions that would otherwise have been lost.

**Historiography**: Documents how colonial scholarship constructed knowledge about India, valuable for studying the history of Indology itself.

**Open Access**: Digitization makes 62 volumes freely accessible, democratizing access to this knowledge.

## Accessing the Journal

Complete digital archives ensure this monumental scholarly resource remains accessible for historical research, epigraphic studies, and understanding the development of Indology.
