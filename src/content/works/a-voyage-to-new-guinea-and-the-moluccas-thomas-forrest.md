# A voyage to New Guinea and the Moluccas, from Balambangan

## Why this matters

Balambangan Island was Britain’s short-lived experiment in establishing a base east of Malacca after the Seven Years’ War. Thomas Forrest’s *Voyage*—packed with charts, vocabularies, and ethnographic notes—captures the Company’s effort to cultivate alliances with Sulu and Magindanao rulers while mapping routes toward New Guinea well before Cook or the Admiralty visited the region.

## What's inside

Forrest details the preparation of the *Tartar Galley*, a shallow-draught vessel crewed by Malays and English seamen. He describes diplomatic exchanges with the Sultan of Sulu, the economic life of Magindanao, voyages through the Moluccas, and an exploratory run to Geelvink Bay (Cenderawasih) in New Guinea. Appendices include Malay and Magindanao vocabularies, tables of latitudes corrected by lunar observations, botanical notes on breadfruit, and four engraved plates depicting ports and vessels.

## Historical setting

Following the 1774 fall of Manila, the Company wanted alternative spice sources and new channels for camphor and bird’s nest trade. Forrest, a veteran pilot, was tasked with securing agreements and testing whether Balambangan could rival Dutch strongholds. Although Sulu partisans destroyed the settlement in 1775, Forrest’s hydrographic data informed later British plans in Borneo and the Sulu Sea.

## Research notes

Forrest combines narrative flair with the precision of a navigator. The journal is valuable for reconstructing pre-colonial political geography in Mindanao and New Guinea, and for understanding Company attempts to operate with lighter, locally crewed vessels. Linguists can mine the appended vocabularies, while environmental historians will note his meticulous descriptions of reefs, currents, and provisioning strategies.

## Access

The Internet Archive copy reproduces the fold-out chart and engraved plates at full resolution. The searchable PDF makes it easy to extract passages on specific locations such as “Magindano” or “Waygiou,” and the text file facilitates comparison with later editions printed in London and Edinburgh.
