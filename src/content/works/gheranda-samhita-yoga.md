description: "The Gheranda Samhita represents Hatha Yoga's most comprehensive classical manual, systematizing physical-spiritual practices through dialogue between sage Gheranda and disciple Chanda comprising seven chapters addressing Ghatastha Yoga (pot-discipline)—perfecting body as vessel for spiritual realization. Composed around late 17th century CE, this detailed text presents 32 asanas (postures) with precise instructions, 25 mudras (seals) channeling energy, 25 pranayamas (breath controls) refining vital force, extensive pratyahara (sense-withdrawal) techniques, dhyana (meditation) methods, and samadhi (absorption) states—constituting seven-limbed path parallel to yet distinct from Patanjali's eight limbs. Beyond technique catalog, Gheranda emphasizes systematic progression: purifying body through shatkarmas (six cleansing actions), strengthening through asanas, energizing through pranayama, internalizing through mudras-pratyahara, concentrating through dhyana, achieving samadhi. The work influenced modern yoga profoundly through detailed asana descriptions, emphasis on physical preparation, and accessible presentation, demonstrating Hatha Yoga's sophisticated methodology combining physicality with spirituality toward embodied realization."
