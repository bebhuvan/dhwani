description: "The Isha Upanishad, among the shortest yet most beloved principal Upanishads, opens with the famous declaration 'Isavasyam idam sarvam' (All this is pervaded by the Lord), establishing divine immanence while teaching renunciation-in-action—engaging worldly duties without attachment, enjoying through relinquishment. Composed around 6th-5th century BCE as the final chapter of Shukla Yajurveda's Vajasaneyi Samhita, this text of eighteen verses profoundly influenced Indian spirituality: Mahatma Gandhi called it his favorite Upanishad, carrying its message of detached action into political struggle; the opening verse inspired karma yoga philosophy balancing renunciation with social engagement; and its teachings on integrating knowledge with action shaped Vedantic practice beyond ascetic withdrawal. The text addresses perennial tensions: transcendence versus immanence, renunciation versus worldly life, knowledge versus ignorance, and immortality versus mortality—resolving apparent contradictions through dialectical wisdom that reality encompasses opposites while transcending them. The Isha's influence extended through Shankara's Advaita commentary, Gandhi's political philosophy, and contemporary discussions integrating spirituality with activism, demonstrating ancient teaching's continuing relevance for addressing modern questions about engaged spirituality, ethical action, and ultimate purpose."
