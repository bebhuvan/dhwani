description: |
  A Prose English Translation of Vishnupuranam represents a critical scholarly rendering of one of the eighteen principal Mahapurana texts of classical Hindu literature, originating from the early medieval period (approximately 3rd-10th century CE). Rooted in the Vaishnavite theological tradition, this translation preserves a foundational Sanskrit text exploring cosmology, mythology, genealogies of divine and royal lineages, and philosophical discourse centered on Vishnu as the supreme divine principle. Professor H. H. Wilson's meticulous translation work, completed during the late colonial period, was instrumental in making this complex Sanskrit text accessible to Western scholars and English-speaking audiences, facilitating cross-cultural scholarly understanding of Hindu intellectual heritage. The Vishnupurana provides comprehensive narratives about the creation of the universe, divine genealogies, historical and mythological accounts of various kingdoms, and intricate theological explanations of dharma, karma, and spiritual evolution. Its significance extends beyond religious documentation, offering profound insights into ancient Indian social structures, philosophical thought, and cosmological understanding. The text elaborates on major Hindu theological concepts, including the avatars of Vishnu, the cyclical nature of cosmic creation and destruction, and the metaphysical relationship between divine consciousness and material existence. As a critical component of Sanskrit literature, this translation enables deeper comprehension of India's rich intellectual and spiritual traditions, bridging historical scholarly interpretations with contemporary academic discourse on classical Indian philosophical and religious texts, and serving as an essential resource for researchers in indology, comparative religion, and cultural studies.

# A Prose English Translation of Vishnupuranam

## Description

This translation renders the Vishnu Purana, one of Hinduism's eighteen Mahapuranas, into accessible English prose, presenting Hindu cosmology, creation mythology, and the divine role of Vishnu. The text synthesizes philosophical teachings with devotional narratives, bridging sacred scripture and literary interpretation. Based on Professor H.H. Wilson's foundational scholarship, it serves scholars and religious practitioners seeking deeper understanding of Hindu metaphysics.

## Cosmological Framework

The Purana opens with dialogue between the sage Parashara and his pupil Maitreya, establishing Hindu temporal philosophy through descriptions of the four Yugas (ages) and cyclical processes of creation, maintenance, and destruction. Vishnu functions as the ultimate principle sustaining cosmic order and all manifest existence.

## Religious and Philosophical Significance

Core themes address dharma (righteous duty), the interconnection between divine principle and manifest reality, and paths to spiritual liberation. The text presents Hindu perspectives on human nature, cosmic law, and the relationship between the eternal and temporal through mythological narratives and philosophical discourse.
