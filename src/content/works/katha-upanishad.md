description: "The Katha Upanishad presents one of Hindu philosophy's most profound explorations of death, immortality, and Self-knowledge through the dramatic dialogue between young Nachiketa and Yama, the god of death. Composed between 600-400 BCE as part of the Krishna Yajurveda's Taittiriya school, this Upanishad employs narrative framework to explore ultimate questions: What happens after death? What is the nature of the immortal Self (Atman)? How does one attain liberation? The text's central teaching—that Atman and Brahman are identical, and realizing this truth conquers death—influenced all subsequent Vedantic philosophy. The famous metaphor comparing the Self to a chariot's rider, intellect to driver, mind to reins, and senses to horses, provided enduring framework for understanding consciousness hierarchy. Nachiketa's unwavering determination to learn death's secrets and his rejection of worldly pleasures for spiritual knowledge established the ideal of the committed seeker (mumukshu) in Indian spirituality."
