# Journael van de Reysen naar Oost-Indien

## Overview
Printed by the Amsterdam publisher Isaac Benjamin, this folio renders Sir Thomas Roe’s official journal into Dutch for readership within the United Provinces. Roe recounts his voyage for King James I, negotiations with Emperor Jahangir, and travel through Surat, Ajmer, and other Mughal centres while securing privileges for the English East India Company.

## Highlights
The volume preserves Roe’s observation of Mughal court ceremony, maritime rivalries among English, Dutch, and Portuguese fleets, and detailed notes on customs duties, caravan routes, and port defences. Copperplate illustrations reproduce coastal profiles and diplomatic audiences, and the editorial notes adjust Roe’s chronology for Dutch reference.

## Access Notes
The Internet Archive scan offers high-resolution images and searchable OCR, allowing readers to compare the Dutch translation with English editions and to study the engravings circulated throughout the Dutch Republic.
