## Historical Context

During the early 17th century, Sir Thomas Roe's diplomatic mission to the Mughal Empire represented a pivotal moment in cross-cultural diplomatic and commercial engagement between European powers and the Indian subcontinent. As the first official English ambassador to the court of Emperor Jahangir (r. 1605-1627), Roe meticulously documented the intricate political and cultural landscape of the Mughal imperial court during its cultural apex. This 1656 Dutch translation of his embassy journal (1615-1619) offers a nuanced European perspective on the sophisticated diplomatic negotiations, trade relations, and cultural interactions that characterized the period. The text is particularly significant for its detailed observations of Mughal court protocols, imperial ceremonies, and the complex commercial networks spanning the Indian Ocean region. Roe's account provides critical insights into the Mughal Empire's economic and diplomatic power, capturing a moment when the Mughal state under Jahangir represented one of the world's most technologically and culturally advanced civilizations. The accompanying engravings offer visual documentation of coastal fortifications, diplomatic audiences, and trading ports, serving as valuable historical and ethnographic records. Beyond its immediate diplomatic purpose, the work represents an important early example of European scholarly engagement with Indian cultural and political systems, bridging European and South Asian intellectual traditions. Roe's observations illuminate the sophisticated diplomatic protocols of the Mughal court, the intricate economic networks of the Indian Ocean trade, and the nuanced cross-cultural interactions that would fundamentally shape subsequent colonial and commercial relationships between European powers and the Indian subcontinent.

Printed by the Amsterdam publisher Isaac Benjamin, this folio renders Sir Thomas Roe’s official journal into Dutch for readership within the United Provinces. Roe recounts his voyage for King James I, negotiations with Emperor Jahangir, and travel through Surat, Ajmer, and other Mughal centres while securing privileges for the English East India Company.

## Highlights
The volume preserves Roe’s observation of Mughal court ceremony, maritime rivalries among English, Dutch, and Portuguese fleets, and detailed notes on customs duties, caravan routes, and port defences. Copperplate illustrations reproduce coastal profiles and diplomatic audiences, and the editorial notes adjust Roe’s chronology for Dutch reference.
