description: "The Taittiriya Upanishad presents systematic Vedantic philosophy through the famous teaching of five sheaths (pancha kosha) progressively revealing the Self—from gross physical body (annamaya kosha) through vital breath, mind, intellect, to bliss sheath (anandamaya kosha)—while containing the immortal injunction 'Matru devo bhava, Pitru devo bhava' (Revere mother as divine, father as divine) expressing Vedic social ethics. Composed around 6th century BCE, this text of three vallis (sections) belongs to the Krishna Yajurveda's Taittiriya Aranyaka and demonstrates pedagogical sophistication: Shiksha Valli teaches phonetics preparing students for Vedic recitation; Brahmananda Valli presents philosophical instruction on Brahman as bliss; and Bhrigu Valli narrates sage Varuna teaching son Bhrigu through progressive inquiry, establishing that Brahman is ananda (bliss). The text's systematic methodology—moving from gross to subtle, physical to spiritual, known to unknown—established frameworks influencing Vedantic pedagogy, yoga psychology (kosha doctrine), and Indian educational philosophy. The Taittiriya's integration of ritual instruction, ethical teaching, philosophical speculation, and contemplative practice demonstrates Vedic tradition's comprehensive approach addressing intellectual, moral, and spiritual development simultaneously."
