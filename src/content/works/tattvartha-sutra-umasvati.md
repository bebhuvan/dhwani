description: "Acharya Umasvati's Tattvartha Sutra represents Jain philosophy's foundational systematic text, the only work accepted as authoritative by both major Jain sects (Digambara and Svetambara). Composed between 2nd-5th century CE, this concise treatise of 357 sutras across ten chapters systematizes Jain metaphysics, epistemology, cosmology, karma theory, and soteriology with extraordinary precision and comprehensiveness. The work establishes seven fundamental principles (tattvas): jiva (soul), ajiva (non-soul), asrava (karmic influx), bandha (bondage), samvara (stoppage), nirjara (dissociation), and moksha (liberation)â€”providing framework for understanding Jain doctrine. Beyond philosophical systematization, the text serves practical function: guiding spiritual practice through clear analysis of existence, causation, and liberation paths. The Tattvartha Sutra's influence on Jain thought proves foundational, generating extensive commentaries across centuries and establishing doctrinal standards accepted across sectarian boundaries, making it comparable to Patanjali's Yoga Sutras or Gautama's Nyaya Sutras for other Indian philosophical schools."
