# The Science of Breath and the Philosophy of the Tattvas

This pioneering work represents one of the first systematic English presentations of ancient Hindu teachings on pranayama (breath control) and the philosophy of the tattvas - the fundamental principles that govern all existence according to Hindu metaphysics. Rama Prasada's scholarly approach makes these profound esoteric teachings accessible to Western readers while preserving their authentic spiritual and philosophical depth.

## About the Authors

**Rama Prasada** was a distinguished Indian scholar who possessed deep knowledge of Hindu philosophical and yogic traditions. His ability to translate complex Sanskrit concepts into clear English made him an important bridge between Eastern wisdom and Western academic understanding during the late 19th century's cultural exchange period.

**G. R. S. Mead** (George Robert Stow Mead) was a prominent member of the Theosophical Society who edited this work, ensuring its scholarly presentation and accessibility to English-speaking audiences. His involvement reflects the Theosophical movement's commitment to preserving and disseminating ancient wisdom traditions from around the world.

## Significance

This work provides essential insights into the sophisticated understanding of breath as both a physiological and spiritual phenomenon in Hindu tradition. The teachings on tattvas reveal how ancient Indian thinkers conceived of the fundamental forces that structure reality, offering a comprehensive metaphysical framework that connects individual practice with cosmic principles.

The book's presentation of pranayama techniques and tattva philosophy contributed to the Western understanding of yogic practices and Hindu metaphysics, influencing the development of comparative philosophy and the modern study of consciousness and breathing techniques.

## Digital Access

This work is freely available through the Internet Archive and Open Library, ensuring continued access for scholars, students, and readers interested in yoga, Hindu philosophy, comparative religion, and the historical development of mind-body practices.
