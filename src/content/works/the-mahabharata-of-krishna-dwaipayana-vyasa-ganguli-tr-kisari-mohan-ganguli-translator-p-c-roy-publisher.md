# The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa (Ganguli tr.)

The Mahabharata stands as the world's longest epic poem and one of the most important texts in human literature. This monumental English translation by Kisari Mohan Ganguli, published serially between 1883-1896, made the complete Sanskrit epic accessible to English readers for the first time. Containing over 100,000 verses, the Mahabharata encompasses the central narrative of the Kurukshetra War alongside profound philosophical teachings, legal principles, and spiritual wisdom that have shaped Indian civilization for millennia.

## About the Authors

**Vyasa** (traditionally dated to 3000 BCE, though the text was composed over centuries) is the legendary sage credited with composing the Mahabharata. Known as Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa, he is revered as one of the greatest figures in Indian literature and philosophy, said to have also compiled the Vedas and authored the Puranas.

**Kisari Mohan Ganguli** (1851-1908) was a distinguished Bengali scholar whose complete English translation of the Mahabharata represents one of the most significant achievements in Sanskrit translation. Working over thirteen years, Ganguli's translation preserved the epic's philosophical depth while making it accessible to international readers. His work remains the most comprehensive English translation of the complete Mahabharata ever undertaken.

## Significance

This epic contains some of the most profound philosophical and spiritual teachings in world literature, including the Bhagavad Gita, Vishnu Sahasranama, and countless other treasures of Indian wisdom. Beyond its central war narrative, the Mahabharata serves as an encyclopedia of Indian culture, containing teachings on dharma (righteous conduct), politics, philosophy, and spiritual realization that continue to guide millions of people worldwide.

Ganguli's translation made this vast repository of knowledge accessible to comparative literature, philosophy, and religious studies, influencing Western understanding of Indian thought and contributing to the global appreciation of Sanskrit literature.

## Digital Access

This work is freely available through the Internet Archive, Wikisource, and Open Library, ensuring continued access for scholars, students, and readers interested in world literature, Hindu philosophy, and the foundational texts of Indian civilization.
