- Poetry
description: The Fugitive is Rabindranath Tagore's powerful and original poetry collection
  published by The Macmillan Company in New York and London in 1921, eight years
  after his Nobel Prize triumph. Comprising 218 pages of verse that ranges from brief
  lyrical poems to extended prose-poems and dramatic verse dialogues, this work represents
  one of Tagore's most experimental and personally revealing English collections.
  The title itself suggests themes of transience, flight, and the ephemeral nature
  of human experience—motifs that permeate the entire volume. Translated into English
  by Tagore himself after his international recognition, The Fugitive explores profound
  themes of faith, love, death, friendship, longing, separation, and the beauty of
  fleeting moments through language that is simultaneously intimate and universal.
  The collection is notable for its innovative blend of prose poetry, verse dialogue,
  and songs, demonstrating Tagore's continued evolution as a poet unafraid to experiment
  with form. Many poems draw from Tagore's personal experiences—his travels through
  the Bengali countryside, tender interactions with his daughter, and his abiding
  love for nature and the Supreme Spirit that animates all existence. Three particularly
  striking prose-verses—"Kacha & Devayani," "Karna & Kunti," and "Somaka & Ritvik"—adapt
  emotionally charged episodes from the ancient Indian epic Mahabharata, showcasing
  Tagore's ability to reimagine classical narratives with modern psychological depth.
  The collection is filled with visions of flight, words exchanged between lovers
  torn apart by circumstance or mortality, and powerful evocations of the natural
  world that serve as mirrors for internal emotional landscapes. Critics have noted
  that "Urvashi," Tagore's rapturous incantation of the Eternal Female, shows affinities
  with Shelley's "Hymn to Intellectual Beauty," positioning Tagore within the broader
  Romantic tradition while maintaining his distinctively Indian voice. The poems
  capture the essence of human emotions and the transient nature of life and love
  with remarkable intensity, moving from moments of ecstatic celebration to profound
  meditations on mortality and loss. Interestingly, Tagore later expressed regret
  about some translations in this volume, wanting several poems deleted from The
  Fugitive, suggesting his own critical engagement with the challenge of rendering
  Bengali poetry into English. Despite or perhaps because of this self-critique,
  the collection reveals a poet at the height of his powers, willing to take risks
  and expose vulnerabilities. The work stands as a bridge between Tagore's earlier
  mystical collections and his later, more philosophically complex writings, demonstrating
  his continued relevance and innovation in the years following his Nobel Prize.
  The Fugitive remains one of Tagore's most emotionally direct and formally adventurous
  collections, offering readers an intimate glimpse into the interior life of a poet
  grappling with love, loss, beauty, and the inexorable passage of time.

# The Fugitive

## Overview

The Fugitive is Rabindranath Tagore's powerful and original poetry collection published by The Macmillan Company in New York and London in 1921, eight years after his Nobel Prize triumph. Comprising 218 pages of verse that ranges from brief lyrical poems to extended prose-poems and dramatic verse dialogues, this work represents one of Tagore's most experimental and personally revealing English collections.

The title itself suggests themes of transience, flight, and the ephemeral nature of human experience—motifs that permeate the entire volume. Translated into English by Tagore himself after his international recognition, The Fugitive explores profound themes of faith, love, death, friendship, longing, separation, and the beauty of fleeting moments through language that is simultaneously intimate and universal.

## Innovation and Style

The collection is notable for its innovative blend of prose poetry, verse dialogue, and songs, demonstrating Tagore's continued evolution as a poet unafraid to experiment with form. Many poems draw from Tagore's personal experiences—his travels through the Bengali countryside, tender interactions with his daughter, and his abiding love for nature and the Supreme Spirit that animates all existence.

Three particularly striking prose-verses—"Kacha & Devayani," "Karna & Kunti," and "Somaka & Ritvik"—adapt emotionally charged episodes from the ancient Indian epic Mahabharata, showcasing Tagore's ability to reimagine classical narratives with modern psychological depth. The collection is filled with visions of flight, words exchanged between lovers torn apart by circumstance or mortality, and powerful evocations of the natural world that serve as mirrors for internal emotional landscapes.

## Literary Context and Significance

Critics have noted that "Urvashi," Tagore's rapturous incantation of the Eternal Female, shows affinities with Shelley's "Hymn to Intellectual Beauty," positioning Tagore within the broader Romantic tradition while maintaining his distinctively Indian voice. The poems capture the essence of human emotions and the transient nature of life and love with remarkable intensity, moving from moments of ecstatic celebration to profound meditations on mortality and loss.

Interestingly, Tagore later expressed regret about some translations in this volume, wanting several poems deleted from The Fugitive, suggesting his own critical engagement with the challenge of rendering Bengali poetry into English. Despite or perhaps because of this self-critique, the collection reveals a poet at the height of his powers, willing to take risks and expose vulnerabilities.
