# The Golden Book of India

## Overview
Compiled during Queen Victoria’s reign, *The Golden Book of India* profiles hereditary rulers and decorated elites recognised by the colonial government. Each entry condenses lines of succession, territorial jurisdictions, and state honours, offering insight into the political hierarchies that structured the princely order on the eve of twentieth-century reforms.

## Highlights
Lethbridge correlates indigenous titles with British distinctions, records the revenue settlements assigned to each estate, and notes educational initiatives patronised by courtly households. The dictionary also documents minority successions and regencies, preserving data used in imperial almanacs and administrative reports.

## Access Notes
The University of Toronto scan features clear typography, enabling keyword search across the entire roster of names. Researchers can download the PDF or browse via the Archive’s viewer to trace specific dynasties, decorations, or alliances referenced elsewhere in colonial records.
