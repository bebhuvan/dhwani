  Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan's "Gautama the Buddha" (1938), originally delivered as the Annual Lecture on a Master Mind to the British Academy on June 28, 1938, and subsequently published by Milford (London) before appearing in the first Indian edition through Hind Kitabs (Bombay, 1945), represents the Oxford Spalding Professor's systematic exposition of the Buddha's life, teachings, and philosophical significance for both historical Buddhist studies and contemporary interfaith dialogue. This concise seventy-four-page biographical-philosophical study synthesizes Radhakrishnan's expertise in Indian philosophy, his comparative religious methodology, and his neo-Vedantic interpretive frameworks to present the Buddha as both revolutionary religious reformer challenging Brahmanical orthodoxy and continuator of deeper Upanishadic philosophical insights—a characterization reflecting ongoing scholarly debates over Buddhism's relationship to Hindu traditions and serving Radhakrishnan's broader agenda demonstrating underlying unity across Indian religious-philosophical systems. The work addresses the Buddha's historical context in sixth-century BCE North India, his biographical narrative from privileged Shakya prince Siddhartha through renunciation and enlightenment to establishment of Sangha monastic community, systematic exposition of Four Noble Truths and Eightfold Path, analysis of key Buddhist philosophical concepts (anatta/no-self, anicca/impermanence, dukkha/suffering, nibbana/nirvana), and assessment of Buddhism's historical impact on Indian civilization and potential contemporary relevance.  Radhakrishnan interprets the Buddha through several interconnected lenses: as ethical reformer emphasizing compassion, non-violence, and social equality against caste hierarchy and ritual formalism; as rational philosopher developing systematic analysis of human existence grounded in empirical observation rather than scriptural authority; as psychological analyst examining consciousness, desire, attachment, and liberation's experiential dimensions; and as spiritual teacher pointing toward transcendent realization beyond conceptual-linguistic formulation. This multi-dimensional presentation reflects Radhakrishnan's characteristic emphasis on Indian philosophy's integration of rational inquiry, ethical concern, and spiritual realization—themes distinguishing his interpretations from both traditional Buddhist scholasticism and modern secular philosophical reconstructions. The lecture's British Academy context positioned it within British academic Orientalism's ongoing engagement with Buddhist studies following landmark nineteenth-century textual translations, archaeological discoveries, and scholarly reconstructions by figures like Thomas Rhys Davids, while Radhakrishnan's status as distinguished Indian scholar provided indigenous intellectual authority challenging exclusively European interpretive frameworks. The work's 1945 Indian publication through Hind Kitabs made it accessible to domestic audiences during crucial period preceding independence when Indian intellectuals sought indigenous philosophical resources for national identity construction and interreligious dialogue amid Hindu-Muslim tensions. Radhakrishnan's interpretation emphasizes Buddhism's continuities with Hindu philosophy particularly regarding ultimate reality's ineffability, liberation's centrality as spiritual goal, and ethical-contemplative practices' importance for realization—positions supporting his neo-Vedantic thesis about underlying unity across Indian religious traditions despite surface doctrinal differences. Critics note this framing potentially minimizes Buddhism's distinctive philosophical innovations particularly its anatta doctrine rejecting permanent self/soul (directly contradicting Vedantic atman concept) and its more radical empiricism eschewing metaphysical speculation about ultimate reality. The work remains significant for understanding mid-twentieth-century approaches to Buddhist philosophy emphasizing its rational-ethical dimensions, for examining how neo-Vedantic scholars framed Buddhism within broader Indian philosophical narratives, and for documenting efforts by prominent Indian intellectuals to present indigenous religious traditions as sophisticated, relevant to modern concerns, and compatible with scientific-philosophical rationality.

## British Academy Lecture Context

"Gautama the Buddha" originated as the 1938 Annual Lecture on a Master Mind delivered to the British Academy on June 28, 1938, during Radhakrishnan's tenure as Spalding Professor of Eastern Religions and Ethics at Oxford University (1936-1952). The British Academy's Master Mind lecture series invited distinguished scholars to present major historical figures who shaped human intellectual and cultural development, positioning the Buddha alongside figures like Plato, Shakespeare, and Newton as subjects of previous lectures.

Radhakrishnan's selection to deliver this prestigious lecture reflected both his scholarly authority on Indian philosophy and the British Academy's recognition of Buddhism's significance for world intellectual history. His presentation to this elite British academic audience required balancing scholarly rigor with accessibility for non-specialists while navigating complex dynamics of presenting indigenous Indian religious traditions to colonial-power institutions during period of intensifying Indian nationalism.

The lecture's subsequent publication by Milford (Oxford University Press imprint) made it available to international scholarly audiences, while the 1945 Indian edition through Hind Kitabs (Bombay) addressed domestic readers during crucial period when intellectuals sought indigenous philosophical resources for national identity construction and interreligious dialogue amid communal tensions preceding independence.

## Philosophical Interpretation and Neo-Vedantic Framework

Radhakrishnan presents the Buddha as both revolutionary reformer and continuator of deeper Upanishadic insights, emphasizing his rational-ethical approach while interpreting his teachings through neo-Vedantic frameworks emphasizing underlying spiritual truths transcending doctrinal formulations. This characterization reflects ongoing debates over Buddhism's relationship to Hindu traditions—whether representing fundamental break from Brahmanical religion or reform movement within broader Indian philosophical continuity.

The work analyzes core Buddhist concepts—Four Noble Truths diagnosing existence as suffering (dukkha) caused by craving, with liberation (nirvana) attainable through Eightfold Path; anatta doctrine denying permanent self; impermanence (anicca) as universal characteristic; and compassion (karuna) as ethical foundation—while suggesting compatibility with Vedantic ultimate concerns despite surface differences. This interpretive strategy supports Radhakrishnan's broader thesis about Indian religions' underlying unity while potentially minimizing Buddhism's distinctive philosophical innovations, particularly anatta's direct contradiction of Vedantic atman (permanent self/soul) concept.

The presentation emphasizes the Buddha's rationality, empiricism, and ethical universalism as making his teachings relevant to modern concerns transcending sectarian boundaries—themes aligning with Radhakrishnan's modernizing agenda demonstrating Indian philosophy's compatibility with scientific rationality and contemporary ethical values while defending its spiritual depth against materialist reductions.

## Significance and Critical Assessment

The work established Radhakrishnan's Buddhist scholarship alongside his better-known Vedantic studies, demonstrating his range across Indian philosophical traditions while documenting his neo-Vedantic interpretive approach to Buddhism. The lecture's prestigious British Academy venue and subsequent publications ensured wide circulation among scholars, students, and general readers interested in Buddhist philosophy and comparative religion.

Modern Buddhist studies scholarship critically assesses Radhakrishnan's neo-Vedantic framing, noting how emphasis on underlying unity potentially obscures Buddhism's distinctive philosophical innovations and how modernizing interpretations prioritize aspects aligning with Western philosophical concerns (rationality, ethics, psychology) while marginalizing traditional Buddhist cosmology, ritual practices, and institutional dimensions. Recent work examines how Indian scholars navigated between defending indigenous traditions against dismissive Orientalism and critically examining them through modern philosophical categories shaped by Western intellectual frameworks.
