description: |
  The Indian Calendar by Robert Sewell, Sankara Balkrishna Dikshit, and Robert Gustav Schram (1896) represents a pivotal scholarly achievement in documenting and systematizing complex Indian temporal methodologies during the late colonial period. Emerging from a critical era of cross-cultural intellectual collaboration, the work synthesizes astronomical, cultural, and administrative knowledge about calendrical systems that had evolved over centuries across the Indian subcontinent. By meticulously mapping conversion techniques between Hindu, Islamic, and Gregorian calendar systems, the text addresses a fundamental scholarly challenge of translating and standardizing diverse temporal frameworks that reflected sophisticated indigenous astronomical understanding. Sankara Balkrishna Dikshit, a distinguished Indian mathematician and astronomer, collaborated with British scholars Robert Sewell and Robert Gustav Schram to produce a comprehensive reference that bridged indigenous knowledge systems with Western scientific methodologies. The work's significance extends beyond mere technical conversion, providing critical insights into the intricate relationship between astronomical observation, cultural practice, and administrative documentation in pre-modern India. Its systematic approach illuminates the complex mathematical and astronomical principles underlying traditional Indian timekeeping, which integrated lunar and solar cycles, regional variations, and sophisticated computational techniques developed over millennia. For historians, anthropologists, and scholars of Indian cultural heritage, the text serves as an invaluable resource for understanding how temporal reckoning reflected broader intellectual and cultural systems, offering a nuanced window into the sophisticated scientific traditions of the Indian subcontinent during a transformative historical period of cultural and scholarly exchange.

# The Indian Calendar: With Tables for the Conversion of Hindu and Muhammadan into A.D. Dates, and Vice Versâ

## Overview

"The Indian Calendar" is a landmark scientific work that solved one of the most challenging problems in Indian historical and astronomical studies: the systematic conversion between different calendar systems used in the Indian subcontinent. Published in 1896, this collaborative work by Robert Sewell, Sankara Balkrishna Dikshit, and Robert Gustav Schram provided scholars with the first comprehensive and mathematically precise method for converting dates between Hindu, Islamic (Muhammadan), and Christian (A.D.) calendar systems. This reference work became indispensable for historians, astronomers, archaeologists, and administrators working with Indian chronological data.

## About the Authors

### Robert Sewell (1845-1925)
**Robert Sewell** was a distinguished British civil servant and historian who spent much of his career in India. As a member of the Indian Civil Service, he developed deep expertise in Indian history and chronology. Beyond his famous work "A Forgotten Empire" on the Vijayanagara kingdom, Sewell was particularly interested in the technical aspects of Indian timekeeping and calendar systems. His administrative experience gave him practical understanding of the challenges posed by multiple calendar systems in daily governance and record-keeping.

### Sankara Balkrishna Dikshit (d. 1898)
**Sankara Balkrishna Dikshit** was a renowned Indian astronomer and mathematician whose expertise in traditional Indian astronomical systems was crucial to this project. As a scholar well-versed in Sanskrit astronomical texts (jyotiṣa śāstra), Dikshit provided the deep knowledge of Hindu calendar systems, astronomical calculations, and traditional Indian chronological methods that made accurate conversion tables possible. His collaboration ensured that the work accurately represented authentic Indian astronomical traditions.

### Robert Gustav Schram (1850-1923)
**Robert Gustav Schram** was an Austrian astronomer and chronologist who contributed advanced mathematical and astronomical expertise to the project. His knowledge of European chronological systems and mathematical methods for calendar calculations provided the scientific framework necessary for creating precise conversion tables. Schram's involvement ensured that the work met international standards of astronomical accuracy.

## Historical and Scientific Context

### The Challenge of Indian Chronology
Before this work, converting dates between Indian and Western calendar systems was extremely difficult because:

- **Multiple Systems**: India used dozens of different calendar systems across regions and communities
- **Complex Calculations**: Hindu calendars involved intricate astronomical calculations based on lunar and solar cycles
- **Regional Variations**: Different kingdoms and regions had their own modifications to basic calendar systems
- **Historical Documentation**: Ancient inscriptions and historical records used various local dating systems
- **Administrative Needs**: British colonial administration needed accurate date conversions for legal and administrative purposes

### Calendar Systems Covered

#### Hindu Calendar Systems
- **Lunar Calendars**: Based on lunar months with periodic adjustments
- **Solar Calendars**: Following solar year divisions
- **Luni-Solar Systems**: Combining lunar months with solar year corrections
- **Regional Variants**: Different systems used in various parts of India
- **Epoch Calculations**: Different starting points (eras) for year counting

#### Islamic Calendar Systems
- **Hijri Calendar**: Pure lunar calendar starting from Prophet Muhammad's migration
- **Regional Adaptations**: Local variations in Islamic calendar usage in India
- **Administrative Records**: Dating systems used in Muslim kingdoms and administration

#### Christian Calendar
- **Julian Calendar**: Used in earlier periods
- **Gregorian Calendar**: Adopted later, requiring conversion methods for both systems
