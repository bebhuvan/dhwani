description: "Vaman Shivaram Apte's Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary, originally published in 1890 by Shiralkar in Poona, stands as one of Sanskrit lexicography's most enduring achievements, rivaling Monier-Williams's dictionary while offering distinct advantages for students and scholars. Apte (1858-1892), a professor of Sanskrit at Fergusson College, Pune, compiled this comprehensive work during his tragically brief life, creating a dictionary specifically designed for practical use by both beginners and advanced scholars. The work's distinctive features include: clear, concise definitions with grammatical information and contextual usage; full explanations of technical terms in Nyaya (logic), Alankara (poetics), Vedanta (philosophy), grammar, and dramaturgy with Sanskrit quotations where necessary; abundant illustrations providing apt examples and idiomatic expressions crucial for reading classical texts; organizational principles separating words with different endings into distinct entries while grouping prefix variations together—contrasting with Monier-Williams's approach; and collection of common nyayas (maxims) under a single entry for easy reference. The dictionary's three appendices add exceptional value: detailed treatment of Sanskrit prosody (chandas) including syllabic feet (ganas), metrical patterns, and scanning techniques essential for reading poetry; comprehensive lists of important literary names from classical Sanskrit literature; and geographical names from ancient Indian history and mythology. Apte also compiled The Student's English-Sanskrit Dictionary (1893), further demonstrating his lexicographical range. The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary's continuing publication by Motilal Banarsidass and other publishers, along with digital availability through University of Chicago's DSAL project and Sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de, attests to its enduring utility. The work remains indispensable for Sanskrit students worldwide, offering practical advantages over larger dictionaries through accessible organization, clear definitions, and valuable appendices—making Apte's early death at age 34 all the more tragic given his extraordinary scholarly contribution achieved in such brief time."
