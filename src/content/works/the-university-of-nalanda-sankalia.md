description: 'During the transformative early decades of 20th-century Indian scholarship,
  Hasmukh D. Sankalia''s seminal 1934 study on the University of Nalanda represents
  a critical scholarly intervention in understanding medieval Indian educational institutions
  and Buddhist intellectual traditions. Situated within the complex archaeological
  and historical research landscape of colonial and post-colonial India, Sankalia''s
  work meticulously reconstructs the academic and cultural significance of Nalanda,
  one of the world''s earliest and most sophisticated residential universities operating
  from the 5th to 12th centuries CE. By synthesizing archaeological evidence, inscriptional
  records, and contemporary Chinese travelers'' accounts—particularly those of Xuanzang
  and I-Tsing—Sankalia provided unprecedented scholarly insight into the institutional
  structure, pedagogical methods, and intellectual networks of this remarkable Buddhist
  monastic university. The study critically examines Nalanda''s comprehensive curriculum,
  which encompassed Buddhist philosophy, Sanskrit literature, mathematics, astronomy,
  and advanced metaphysical studies, positioning it as a sophisticated center of learning
  that attracted scholars from across Asia. Sankalia''s research was particularly
  significant in challenging colonial-era narratives about Indian educational systems,
  demonstrating the intellectual sophistication and systematic academic organization
  of pre-colonial Indian institutions. His methodological approach, blending archaeological
  analysis with historical interpretation, was pioneering for its time and established
  foundational methodological frameworks for subsequent generations of Indian historians
  and archaeologists. The work not only reconstructs Nalanda''s institutional history
  but also illuminates the broader intellectual and cultural exchanges that characterized
  Buddhist scholarly networks across medieval South and Southeast Asia, making it
  an indispensable contribution to understanding India''s rich educational and philosophical
  heritage.
