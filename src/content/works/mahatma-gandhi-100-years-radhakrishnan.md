  "Mahatma Gandhi: 100 Years," published in 1968 by the Gandhi Peace Foundation under the auspices of the National Committee for the Gandhi Centenary, represents a monumental international tribute commemorating the hundredth anniversary of Gandhi's birth (October 2, 1869), assembling reflections from world leaders, philosophers, scientists, and cultural figures examining his enduring influence on twentieth-century political thought, nonviolent resistance movements, and spiritual-ethical discourse. Edited by Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (philosopher and former President of India), R.R. Diwakar, and K. Swaminathan, the 401-page volume appeared during a pivotal historical moment: twenty-one years after Indian independence, one year after the global tumult of 1967-68 marked by civil rights struggles, anti-war protests, and decolonization movements, all influenced by Gandhian principles of nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience. The festschrift's international contributor roster—including Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie, physicist Werner Heisenberg, philosopher Karl Jaspers, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, UN Secretary-General U Thant, and Lord Mountbatten—testified to Gandhi's transcendence of national boundaries and disciplinary confines, positioning him as moral exemplar and political strategist whose methods and philosophy addressed universal questions about violence, justice, truth, and human dignity. The volume's publication coincided with intensified global engagement with Gandhi's legacy: Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination in April 1968 highlighted the continuing relevance and tragic costs of nonviolent struggle, while widespread social upheaval demonstrated both the power and limitations of Gandhian methods in confronting entrenched power structures, systemic racism, imperial violence, and economic exploitation. Contributors examined multiple dimensions of Gandhi's significance: his development of satyagraha (truth-force) as systematic methodology for political resistance, his synthesis of spiritual discipline and mass mobilization, his experiments with communal living and economic self-sufficiency, his advocacy for religious pluralism and communal harmony, his controversial positions on technology, modernity, and Western civilization, and his complex legacy regarding caste, gender, and social reform. The collection demonstrated ongoing debates about interpreting Gandhi's relevance: whether his village-centered economics offered viable alternative to industrial capitalism or romanticized premodern poverty, whether his emphasis on moral persuasion adequately addressed structural violence and economic oppression, whether his religious framework enabled or constrained secular political movements, and whether his specific tactics retained efficacy amid Cold War geopolitics, nuclear proliferation, and revolutionary socialism. Essays addressed Gandhi's international influence on independence movements across Africa, Asia, and Latin America, his impact on Western peace movements and conscientious objection, his philosophical dialogues with figures including Tolstoy, Ruskin, and Thoreau, and his exemplification of what Radhakrishnan termed "practical idealism"—the insistence that spiritual values must inform political action and that ethical means determine outcomes regardless of strategic calculations. The volume appeared amid contested memories of Gandhi within India itself: debates between those emphasizing his conservative social views and those highlighting his radical challenges to colonialism and capitalism, between secularists uncomfortable with his religious language and devotees venerating him as mahatma (great soul), and between those celebrating his achievements and critics noting his failures regarding partition violence, caste oppression, and gender inequality. The centenary publication exemplified the process of canonization and commemoration transforming complex, contradictory historical figures into simplified symbols: Gandhi the universal apostle of nonviolence versus Gandhi the shrewd political tactician, Gandhi the spiritual seeker versus Gandhi the pragmatic negotiator, Gandhi the revolutionary challenging British imperialism versus Gandhi the conservative defending caste and patriarchy. Contributors' diverse perspectives—ranging from philosophical analysis to personal reminiscence, political assessment to spiritual reflection—captured the multifaceted nature of Gandhi's influence while revealing the interpretive filters through which different audiences understood his significance. The work's publication by the Gandhi Peace Foundation, established in 1959 to preserve and promote Gandhian philosophy, situated it within institutionalized efforts to define and disseminate particular interpretations of Gandhi's legacy for postcolonial nation-building, international peace activism, and interfaith dialogue. The volume contributed to establishing Gandhi as global icon transcending Indian nationalist context, making his methods and philosophy available for appropriation by diverse movements while potentially decontextualizing his specific struggles within colonial India and diluting his radical critique of Western civilization, capitalism, and technological modernity. The centenary commemoration coincided with growing scholarly and popular engagement with Gandhi's writings—particularly his autobiography and collected works—enabling more nuanced understanding beyond hagiography or simplification, while generating critical reassessments examining his limitations alongside his achievements.

## Publication Context and the Gandhi Centenary

"Mahatma Gandhi: 100 Years" appeared in 1968 as the centerpiece of global commemorations marking the hundredth anniversary of Gandhi's birth on October 2, 1869. The National Committee for the Gandhi Centenary, established by the Indian government, coordinated international observances including conferences, publications, exhibitions, and cultural events designed to celebrate Gandhi's legacy and renew commitment to his principles amid Cold War tensions, decolonization struggles, and social upheaval. The centenary occurred during extraordinary global ferment: the year 1968 witnessed Prague Spring's democratic awakening and Soviet suppression, student and worker uprisings in Paris, anti-Vietnam War protests across America, the Tet Offensive revealing American military vulnerability, and Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination in April—making the commemoration of nonviolence's apostle both poignant and urgent. The volume's publication through Gandhi Peace Foundation, established in 1959 by prominent Gandhians including Radhakrishnan to preserve and promote Gandhi's philosophy, represented institutionalized effort to define authoritative interpretation of his legacy for younger generations lacking direct experience of independence struggle. The choice of editors proved significant: Radhakrishnan brought philosophical gravitas and international prestige as former President of India (1962-1967) and Oxford professor; R.R. Diwakar contributed grassroots Gandhian credibility as freedom fighter and sarvodaya movement leader; and K. Swaminathan offered scholarly expertise as Gandhi biographer and literary figure. Their collaborative editorial framework ensured the volume balanced academic rigor, political commemoration, and spiritual reverence, positioning Gandhi simultaneously as historical figure, political strategist, and moral exemplar transcending temporal and cultural boundaries.

## International Contributors and Global Perspectives

The volume's extraordinary roster of international contributors testified to Gandhi's transcendence of Indian nationalist context, demonstrating his influence on diverse domains including politics, science, philosophy, and religious thought. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's contribution carried particular significance: daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru (Gandhi's political heir and India's first Prime Minister), she wrote during her first term leading a nation still negotiating Gandhi's complex legacy—his successful mobilization of mass independence movement against his failure to prevent partition violence, his advocacy for village self-sufficiency against Nehru's industrial modernization, his emphasis on moral politics against pragmatic governance imperatives. Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie's essay reflected African leaders' engagement with Gandhian nonviolence during decolonization struggles, though the continent's subsequent embrace of armed resistance in contexts where peaceful protest faced violent suppression complicated simple application of Gandhi's methods. British Prime Minister Harold Wilson's participation represented former colonizer's reckoning with Gandhi's legacy, acknowledging his moral authority while potentially obscuring British imperialism's violence that necessitated resistance. UN Secretary-General U Thant's contribution positioned Gandhi within international peace discourse, though the UN's inability to prevent Cold War proxy wars, nuclear proliferation, and ongoing colonialism revealed the limits of moral suasion absent structural transformation. Physicist Werner Heisenberg's essay demonstrated Gandhi's influence beyond politics to epistemological and ethical questions raised by modern science—particularly nuclear weapons development and scientists' moral responsibility for their discoveries' applications. Philosopher Karl Jaspers's contribution engaged Gandhi as exemplar of "philosophical faith" synthesizing contemplative wisdom and worldly engagement, though European existentialism's tragic vision contrasted with Gandhi's ultimate optimism about truth's power. The diverse contributors' perspectives revealed both Gandhi's genuine international impact and the selective appropriation of his legacy: emphasizing universal nonviolence while minimizing his specific anti-colonial and anti-capitalist critiques, celebrating his spiritual-moral vision while sidelining his radical economic and social programs, and venerating him as individual exemplar while neglecting the mass movements and collective struggle essential to his achievements.

## Radhakrishnan's Interpretation: The Practical Idealist

Radhakrishnan's editorial framing and likely introductory essay positioned Gandhi as "practical idealist"—synthesizing contemplative spirituality with effective political action, moral principles with strategic pragmatism, and universal ethics with specific historical struggles. This interpretation aligned with Radhakrishnan's broader philosophical project articulating Indian thought as rational, universal, and addressing modern challenges while remaining grounded in spiritual wisdom. He emphasized Gandhi's experimental methodology—testing philosophical and ethical principles through lived practice, subjecting spiritual insights to empirical verification through political campaigns, and refining methods based on results rather than dogmatic adherence to predetermined systems. Radhakrishnan highlighted Gandhi's integration of traditionally separate domains: religious faith and secular politics, individual moral transformation and collective social change, spiritual transcendence and material engagement, and Eastern wisdom and Western modernity. This synthetic vision positioned Gandhi as exemplar of Radhakrishnan's own philosophical commitments: Vedantic non-dualism informing ethical universalism, experiential spirituality grounding political activism, and cultural pluralism enabling interfaith dialogue and international cooperation. However, Radhakrishnan's interpretation potentially minimized tensions and contradictions in Gandhi's thought: between his technological skepticism and need for modern communication enabling mass mobilization, between his caste-critical rhetoric and defense of varna system, between his nonviolence principles and pragmatic compromises with violence including military recruitment and provisional acceptance of police force, and between his universalist ethics and particularist Hindu symbolism. Radhakrishnan's philosophical idealism risked abstracting Gandhi's specific struggles—against British colonial exploitation, landlord oppression, untouchability, and communal violence—into timeless spiritual truths divorced from material conditions and power relations driving historical conflicts. His emphasis on Gandhi's spiritual dimensions potentially obscured the hard political calculations, organizational discipline, and strategic acumen underlying satyagraha's effectiveness, making Gandhi's success appear result of moral authority rather than systematic methodology combining mass mobilization, economic pressure, international public opinion, and British imperial weakness.

## Themes and Assessments: Nonviolence, Truth, and Social Transformation

Contributors examined multiple dimensions of Gandhi's philosophy and practice, generating diverse assessments of his enduring relevance and limitations. Essays on satyagraha analyzed its theoretical foundations—the insistence that truth (satya) and nonviolent soul-force (ahimsa) possess inherent power compelling opponents' conversion through voluntary suffering—and practical applications in campaigns from South African struggles against racial discrimination through Indian independence movement's mass civil disobedience. Some contributors emphasized satyagraha's universal applicability to struggles against injustice, highlighting successful adaptations by American civil rights movement, anti-apartheid resistance, and peace activism, while others questioned whether its effectiveness depended on specific conditions including opponents' susceptibility to moral persuasion, democratic contexts enabling public opinion mobilization, and struggles against foreign occupiers rather than indigenous oppression. The volume addressed Gandhi's economic philosophy, particularly swadeshi (local self-sufficiency), khadi (hand-spinning), and village-centered development, generating debates about whether these represented viable alternatives to industrial capitalism or romanticized premodern poverty inadequately addressing population growth, technological change, and global economic integration. Contributors examined Gandhi's religious pluralism and communal harmony advocacy, assessing both his successes promoting interfaith cooperation and his ultimate failure preventing partition violence that claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and displaced millions, raising questions about whether religious frameworks enabled or constrained secular democratic politics. Essays engaged Gandhi's social reform efforts including anti-untouchability campaigns, women's participation in public life, and basic education programs, acknowledging progressive dimensions while noting limitations: his retention of varna categories despite condemning untouchability, his patriarchal assumptions despite mobilizing women, and his emphasis on moral transformation potentially deflecting attention from structural inequalities requiring legal and economic remedies. The volume's treatment of Gandhi's relationship to modernity proved particularly complex: some contributors celebrated his critique of Western materialism, technological domination, and unlimited growth, anticipating contemporary environmental and anti-globalization movements, while others argued his technological skepticism and village romanticism offered inadequate responses to urbanization, industrialization, and mass society's challenges.

## Legacy and Contested Interpretations

The centenary volume appeared amid intensifying debates about Gandhi's relevance to contemporary struggles, reflecting broader contests over his memory and meaning. Within India, conflicts emerged between those emphasizing different aspects of his legacy: Gandhian socialists highlighting his economic radicalism and critique of capitalism versus Hindu nationalists appropriating his religious symbolism while ignoring his pluralism and anti-communalism; secularists uncomfortable with his religious language versus devotees venerating him as spiritual figure; and social reformers celebrating his progressive elements versus Dalit critics challenging his caste conservatism. Internationally, civil rights and anti-war movements drew inspiration from Gandhi's nonviolent methods while adapting them to different contexts and sometimes embracing violence when peaceful protest faced brutal suppression, as in Black Power movements and Third World liberation struggles. The volume's publication coincided with growing scholarly attention to Gandhi's writings beyond hagiographic treatments, enabling more nuanced understanding of his complexity, contradictions, and evolution over six decades of activism. Critical assessments emerged examining his positions on race during South African years, his attitudes toward caste and untouchability, his views on gender and sexuality including controversial experiments testing celibacy, and his relationships with disciples and political allies revealing both inspiring dedication and troubling authoritarianism. Feminist scholars questioned his patriarchal assumptions and instrumental use of women's participation, Dalit intellectuals challenged his opposition to separate electorates and defense of caste system, and postcolonial theorists analyzed how his emphasis on spiritual-moral transformation potentially obscured material politics of exploitation and structural violence. Despite these critiques, the centenary demonstrated Gandhi's enduring influence on diverse movements seeking alternatives to violent revolution and capitalist competition, even as specific applications of his methods yielded mixed results and ongoing debates about their contemporary relevance.
