# Memoirs on the History, Folk-Lore, and Distribution of the Races of the North-Western Provinces

## Overview
Drawing on district surveys conducted for revenue administration, Elliot compiled a glossary of vernacular terms describing castes, tribes, and local institutions. In 1869 John Beames revised and enlarged the work, adding linguistic notes and ethnographic sketches that document origin legends and migration traditions in the North-Western Provinces and Oudh.

## Highlights
Entries provide vernacular spellings, social status, occupational specialisations, and geographic spread for hundreds of communities. Beames appends folk narratives, references to Persian chronicles, and cross-links to administrative gazetteers, making the volume an important source for historians of caste formation and colonial knowledge systems.

## Access Notes
The Internet Archive edition reproduces the full text of the expanded glossary with reliable OCR, allowing researchers to search for community names, ritual terms, and geographic references across the dense annotations.
