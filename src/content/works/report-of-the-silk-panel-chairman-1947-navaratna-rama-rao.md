  Published in 1947 during India's momentous transition to independence, the Report of the Silk Panel represents a critical scholarly document examining the intricate economic and cultural landscape of sericulture at a pivotal moment of national transformation. Chaired by Navaratna Rama Rao, a distinguished economist and industrial policy expert who bridged colonial administrative practices and emergent nationalist economic planning, the report comprehensively analyzed India's silk sector during a period of profound structural reconfiguration. Against the backdrop of decolonization and nascent economic sovereignty, the panel meticulously documented the existing silk production ecosystem—encompassing traditional weaving communities, technological infrastructures, trade networks, and potential modernization pathways. By systematically examining sericulture's technological, economic, and social dimensions, the report provided a nuanced blueprint for reimagining an industrial sector deeply embedded in India's cultural and economic heritage. The document critically evaluated existing production methodologies, proposed sophisticated research infrastructures, recommended standardized technical protocols, and outlined innovative credit mechanisms designed to stabilize and elevate silk production quality. Significantly, the panel's work transcended mere economic analysis, representing an intellectual endeavor to reframe indigenous productive capacities within a context of national self-determination. By proposing structured interventions that respected traditional craftsmanship while advocating technological modernization, the report embodied the complex negotiations of cultural continuity and developmental aspiration characteristic of India's immediate post-independence intellectual discourse. As a scholarly artifact, it illuminates the intricate processes of economic policy-making during a transformative historical moment, offering profound insights into India's strategic reimagining of its economic and cultural potential.

# Report of the Silk Panel (1947)

## Overview

Published by the Manager, Government of India Press, Simla (1947) under the Department of Industries and Supplies, this report distills the Silk Panel's comprehensive review of India's sericulture and silk manufacturing sector conducted during the transition to Independence. The panel examined the entire supply chain—from mulberry cultivation through silk reeling, weaving, and trade—identifying bottlenecks and proposing systematic interventions to improve quality, stabilize production, and enhance India's position in international silk markets.

## About the Chairman

Navaratna Rama Rao (1877–1960) was an eminent Mysore-based political leader and writer. The title "Navaratna" (Nine Gems) was conferred by the seer of Uttaradi Mutt for his scholarly services. His chairmanship of the Silk Panel reflected his administrative experience and economic policy expertise during a critical transitional moment in Indian governance.

## The Report

**Scope of Investigation:**
The panel systematically examined:
- **Sericulture:** Mulberry cultivation, silkworm rearing, cocoon production
- **Reeling technology:** Traditional vs. modern reeling methods, quality standardization
- **Weaving sector:** Handloom and power-loom production, design development
- **Market organization:** Domestic trade, export structures, pricing mechanisms
- **Labor and production:** Working conditions, seasonal patterns, credit availability
- **Regional variations:** Mysore, Bengal, Kashmir, and other silk-producing regions

**Methodological Approach:**
- Field investigations and site visits to silk-producing regions
- Testimony from cultivators, reelers, weavers, and traders
- Analysis of production data and trade statistics
- International comparisons with China, Japan, and European silk industries
- Technical assessments of equipment and processing methods

**Key Recommendations:**
- Technical standards for cocoon quality and reeling processes
- Establishment of research stations and extension services
- Credit mechanisms for cultivators and small producers
- Training programs for improved sericulture techniques
- Quality certification systems for export markets
- Infrastructure development for rural silk production

## Historical Significance

The report represents a crucial moment in India's industrial policy development:

**Late-Colonial Context:** Documents the state of traditional industries at Independence, revealing colonial-era neglect of systematic support for artisanal production.

**Post-Independence Planning:** The recommendations influenced early Five-Year Plan allocations for sericulture research and development. The report's emphasis on quality improvement, technical education, and credit access became templates for cottage industry policy.

**Regional Economies:** Provides detailed documentation of silk production's role in rural economies, particularly in Mysore, Bengal, and Kashmir, where sericulture sustained significant agricultural populations.

## Primary Source Value

The report offers rich material for historians of:
- **Industrial policy:** How the state conceptualized intervention in traditional sectors
- **Economic transition:** Structures inherited from colonial rule and proposed reforms
- **Agricultural extension:** Models for technical improvement and knowledge transfer
- **Regional development:** Comparative analysis of silk-producing areas
- **Labor history:** Working conditions, seasonal migration, and credit dependency

Annexures contain statistical tables, technical specifications, and documentation providing quantitative baselines for subsequent research.
