# The Oxford History of India: From the Earliest Times to the End of 1911

## Overview

Published by Oxford University Press in 1919, *The Oxford History of India* stands as one of the most comprehensive and influential historical surveys of the Indian subcontinent ever produced. Spanning 870 pages, this magisterial work traces the arc of Indian civilization from its prehistoric origins through millennia of dynasties, empires, and cultural transformations, concluding on the eve of World War I and the momentous changes that would reshape the subcontinent.

This is not merely a chronicle of kings and battles, but a sophisticated synthesis that weaves together political history, cultural development, religious movements, economic systems, and social structures. The work encompasses the Indus Valley Civilization, the Vedic period, the rise of Buddhism and Jainism, the great empires of the Mauryas and Guptas, the medieval Hindu kingdoms, the Delhi Sultanate, the Mughal golden age, and the establishment and consolidation of British rule. It represents the culmination of early 20th-century Indological scholarship, combining textual analysis, archaeological findings, numismatic evidence, and administrative records into a coherent historical narrative.

## About Vincent Arthur Smith (1848-1920)

Vincent Arthur Smith stands among the foremost historians of India during the colonial period, bringing both the perspective of an administrator and the rigor of a trained scholar to his historical works. Born in Dublin and educated at Trinity College, Smith joined the Indian Civil Service in 1871, serving for nearly three decades in what is now Uttar Pradesh. He rose to the position of Chief Secretary before retiring in 1900 to devote himself fully to historical research and writing.

Smith's career bridged two crucial roles: as a colonial administrator, he gained intimate knowledge of Indian society, governance, and cultural practices; as a scholar, he applied critical historical methods and archaeological analysis to understanding India's past. He was instrumental in exposing archaeological forgeries—most notably catching Alois Anton Führer fabricating inscriptions—demonstrating his commitment to scholarly integrity over sensationalism.

His major works include *The Early History of India* (which became a standard textbook), monographs on emperors Ashoka and Akbar, and studies of Indian art and coinage. Smith was recognized with a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire and received an honorary doctorate from Trinity College Dublin in 1919, the same year this Oxford History was published. He continuously revised and updated his works to incorporate new archaeological discoveries and evolving historical understanding.

## About Stephen Meredyth Edwardes (1873-1927)

Stephen Edwardes brought complementary expertise to this collaboration, particularly regarding the later periods of Indian history and administrative matters. Educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford, Edwardes entered the Indian Civil Service in 1894 and had a distinguished career in Bombay (now Mumbai).

As the first civilian Bombay Police Commissioner (1909-1916) and later Municipal Commissioner (1916-1918), Edwardes dealt firsthand with the complexities of governance in colonial India, managing religious and ethnic tensions while reforming police practices. His administrative experience informed his historical writing, particularly regarding the Mughal period and British rule.

Edwardes was a prolific author who wrote extensively on Bombay's history, Mughal rule, Indian crime and social issues, and biographies of prominent figures. His major independent works include *The Bombay City Police: A Historical Sketch, 1672–1916* (1923) and *Mughal Rule in India* (1930). He was honored as Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (1912) and Companion of the Order of the Star of India (1915).

## Historical Context and Scholarly Significance

Published in 1919, just after World War I and at a pivotal moment in Indian history, this work represents the mature flowering of British Indological scholarship. The year 1911—where the narrative concludes—marked significant events including the Delhi Durbar celebrating George V's coronation and the announcement of the capital's transfer from Calcutta to Delhi. The authors chose to end their account just before the war and the growing momentum of the independence movement would transform the political landscape.

The Oxford History embodies the colonial-era approach to Indian history: comprehensive, chronological, and focused on political developments and administrative structures. Yet Smith's genuine respect for Indian civilization, his mastery of sources in multiple languages, and his archaeological rigor elevated this work beyond mere imperial propaganda. He sought to present India's history as a sophisticated civilization with its own internal dynamics, not merely as background to British conquest.

The work became the standard academic reference for Indian history in English-speaking universities for much of the 20th century. While subsequent scholarship has challenged some of its interpretations and highlighted its colonial biases, it remains valuable for understanding how India's past was constructed and taught during the late British Raj. The book also preserves valuable contemporary perspectives on events and contains descriptions of archaeological sites and inscriptions, some of which have since been lost or damaged.

## Structure and Scope

The 870-page volume provides systematic coverage of:

- **Prehistoric and Ancient India**: The Indus Valley Civilization, Aryan migrations, Vedic society, and the formation of early kingdoms
- **Classical Period**: The Mauryan Empire under Chandragupta and Ashoka, the Indo-Greek kingdoms, the Kushanas, and the Gupta golden age
- **Medieval India**: Regional kingdoms, the Rajputs, the arrival of Islam, and the Delhi Sultanate
- **Mughal Period**: The founding, zenith, and decline of the Mughal Empire from Babur through Aurangzeb and beyond
- **European Arrival and Colonial Period**: Portuguese, Dutch, French, and British involvement, culminating in the establishment of the British Raj
- **Modern Period**: The consolidation of British rule, the 1857 uprising, administrative reforms, and developments through 1911

Each period receives treatment not only of political and military events but also of religious movements, architectural achievements, literary developments, and economic conditions. Smith incorporated insights from epigraphy, numismatics, art history, and literature alongside traditional chronicles and administrative records.

## Critical Perspective

Modern readers should approach this work with awareness of its colonial-era origins and limitations. The narrative reflects the perspectives, biases, and assumptions of British scholars who viewed Indian history through the lens of their own civilization and imperial project. The emphasis on political history and royal dynasties, the relative marginalization of social and economic history, and the treatment of British rule as a progressive culmination all reflect the historiographical conventions and ideological positions of early 20th-century colonial scholarship.

Yet the work also represents serious scholarly engagement with India's past. Smith's commitment to archaeological evidence, his efforts to date events accurately using multiple sources, his attention to Indian literary traditions, and his genuine fascination with Indian culture make this more than mere colonial apologetics. The book preserves valuable observations about monuments, inscriptions, and social conditions from a century ago.

Contemporary scholars studying Indian history recognize both the achievements and the limitations of this foundational text. It represents an important stage in the development of Indian historiography, bridging older Orientalist approaches and modern critical methods. Understanding how colonial-era scholars constructed narratives of India's past is itself an important aspect of historical study.

## Legacy and Continued Relevance

*The Oxford History of India* went through multiple editions and revisions, remaining in print for decades as the standard English-language survey of Indian history. Later scholars would build upon, critique, and move beyond its framework, but it established the chronological structure and periodization that influenced subsequent historical writing.

The work contributed to the formation of Indian historical consciousness during the independence movement, as educated Indians engaged with, contested, and reinterpreted this colonial construction of their past. Nationalist historians like R.C. Majumdar would later produce alternative narratives, while post-independence scholarship has fundamentally revised many of Smith's interpretations.

Today, the book serves multiple purposes: as a historical document revealing colonial perspectives, as a repository of observations and descriptions valuable for comparison with modern archaeological understanding, and as a landmark in the development of Indological studies. For students of historiography, it illuminates how historical narratives are shaped by their authors' contexts and purposes.

## Digital Preservation and Access

This digitized edition from the Internet Archive makes this influential historical work freely accessible to contemporary readers, researchers, and students worldwide. The preservation of such texts in digital format ensures that future generations can engage with the evolution of historical scholarship and understand how interpretations of India's past have developed over time.

For those interested in Indian history, colonial scholarship, the development of Indology, or the historiography of South Asia, Smith and Edwardes' *Oxford History of India* remains an essential primary source—not as an uncritical guide to India's past, but as a significant artifact in the history of how that past has been studied, interpreted, and contested.
