# Hindu Superiority: An Attempt to Determine the Position of the Hindu Race in the Scale of Nations

This comprehensive study by Har Bilas Sarda examines the achievements and contributions of Hindu civilization to world culture and knowledge. Written in 1906 during the colonial period, the work represents an important early attempt to systematically document and assert the historical significance of Indian cultural, intellectual, and spiritual traditions in response to colonial narratives that often diminished or overlooked India's contributions to human civilization.

## About Har Bilas Sarda

**Har Bilas Sarda** (1867-1955) was a distinguished judge, politician, social reformer, and scholar who played a significant role in India's independence movement and social reform efforts. A graduate of the University of Calcutta and follower of Dayanand Saraswati, Sarda combined legal expertise with deep scholarship in Indian history and culture. He is perhaps best known for introducing the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 1929, which raised the minimum age of marriage. As a member of the Central Legislative Assembly and recipient of the Dewan Bahadur title, Sarda used his position to advocate for both social reform and cultural pride.

## Significance

This work represents an important document in the history of Indian intellectual discourse during the colonial period. Sarda's systematic examination of Hindu achievements in philosophy, science, literature, and governance provided a scholarly foundation for cultural nationalism and helped counter colonial assertions about Indian civilization. The work demonstrates how Indian intellectuals of the early 20th century sought to reclaim their cultural heritage while engaging with modern academic methods.

While reflecting the comparative civilizational perspectives of its era, the work contributed to a broader movement of cultural renaissance that influenced India's path toward independence and cultural self-assertion.
