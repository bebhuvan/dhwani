description: "Banabhatta's Kadambari stands as Sanskrit prose literature's supreme achievement, a romantic narrative of extraordinary linguistic complexity and philosophical depth. Composed in 7th-century CE at Emperor Harsha's court, this mahakavya in prose traces two parallel love stories across rebirths: the frame narrative of King Tarapida and apsara Mahashveta, and the embedded tale of Chandrapeeda (Tarapida reborn) and Kadambari (Mahashveta reborn). Left incomplete at Banabhatta's death, his son Bhushanabhatta concluded the work while maintaining stylistic continuity. The narrative's elaborate prose—featuring extended compounds (samasas), complex sentence structures, and virtuosic word-play—exemplifies gadya-kavya at its ornate peak. Beyond linguistic artistry, Kadambari explores Buddhist-influenced themes of karma, reincarnation, renunciation, and love's transcendence of death, while depicting courtly culture, forest hermitages, and supernatural realms with vivid detail."
