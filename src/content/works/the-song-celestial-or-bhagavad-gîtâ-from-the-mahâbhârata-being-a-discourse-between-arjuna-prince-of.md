description: |
  Sir Edwin Arnold's "The Song Celestial" (1885) represents Victorian England's most influential poetic rendering of the Bhagavad Gita, translating the Sanskrit philosophical dialogue into English blank verse modeled on Tennysonian rhythm and diction. Arnold's translation, while taking considerable liberties with literal accuracy, succeeded in introducing Hindu philosophy to Western readers through familiar poetic conventions, emphasizing the text's universal spiritual themes of duty (dharma), selfless action (karma yoga), and divine devotion (bhakti). Published at the height of Orientalist fascination with Indian spirituality, Arnold's work shaped Anglo-American understanding of Hindu thought for generations, though modern scholars critique its Victorian sentimentalization and theological reinterpretation of Krishna's teachings. The translation emerged from Arnold's broader project of comparative religion, following his earlier "The Light of Asia" (1879) on Buddhism, and reflects the complex nineteenth-century encounter between British imperialism and Indian philosophical traditions. Arnold's rendering of the Gita as "The Song Celestial" emphasizes its devotional and ethical dimensions while often subordinating its more challenging metaphysical subtleties to Victorian moral sensibilities, creating a text that served both as genuine spiritual introduction and as cultural appropriation characteristic of its imperial moment.
