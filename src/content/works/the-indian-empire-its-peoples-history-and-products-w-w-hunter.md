# The Indian Empire: Its Peoples, History, and Products

## Overview

Published in 1886 by Trübner & Co. in London as part of Trübner's Oriental Series, *The Indian Empire: Its Peoples, History, and Products* represents Sir William Wilson Hunter's effort to distill over a decade of statistical surveying into a single-volume administrative handbook. The work comprises 747 pages plus preliminary matter totaling 794 pages in octavo format, condensing information originally compiled across 128 volumes and 60,000 pages of statistical surveys into an accessible reference. Hunter drew upon his compilation of the *Imperial Gazetteer of India* (first edition 1881, nine volumes) and the twenty-volume *Statistical Account of Bengal* (1875-1877) to produce this comprehensive overview.

The volume served multiple administrative and educational purposes within the British imperial apparatus. As a distillation of systematic statistical data collected during Hunter's twelve-year tenure (1869-1881) organizing India's statistical survey under Lord Mayo's commission, it functioned as both a ready reference for colonial administrators and a textbook for understanding Britain's largest territorial possession. The work appeared during the height of Victorian imperialism, providing bureaucratic personnel with essential geographic, demographic, economic, and historical information for governance. A revised edition appeared in 1895 under the title *The Indian Empire: Its People, History and Products*, achieving widespread adoption in Indian schools and administrative training programs.

Hunter structured the volume to combine ethnographic classification, historical chronology, economic data, and administrative geography into a systematic framework. The work included statistical tables, administrative district information, and a folding map, reflecting Hunter's training in statistical methodology and his position as one of the principal architects of British India's information-gathering infrastructure. The text synthesized materials from provincial gazetteers, census operations, revenue surveys, and administrative reports compiled under Hunter's supervision during his Indian Civil Service career from 1862 to 1887.

## About the Author — W. W. Hunter

Sir William Wilson Hunter (1840-1900) exemplified the scholar-administrator archetype of Victorian India. Born July 15, 1840, in Glasgow, Scotland, Hunter completed his BA at the University of Glasgow (1860) before studying at Paris and Bonn, where he acquired Sanskrit proficiency. He passed first in the 1862 Indian Civil Service examination, arriving in Bengal Presidency in November 1862 to serve as assistant magistrate and collector of Birbhum district.

In 1869, Governor-General Lord Mayo selected Hunter to organize a comprehensive statistical survey of India, a commission that occupied twelve years and established his reputation as the preeminent statistical authority on British India. This project produced the first edition of the *Imperial Gazetteer of India* (nine volumes, 1881), expanded to fourteen volumes in the second edition (1885-1887). Hunter supervised the *Statistical Account of Bengal* (twenty volumes, 1875-1877) and similar compilations for Assam (two volumes, 1879), creating standardized templates for provincial statistical documentation. He contributed major articles on Indian cities to the *Encyclopædia Britannica* (ninth edition) and served as vice-chancellor of the University of Calcutta (1886).

Hunter's other significant works include *The Annals of Rural Bengal* (1868), *The Indian Musalmans* (1871)—examining whether Muslims were religiously bound to rebel against British rule—and *A Brief History of the Indian Peoples* (1880). He presided over the Commission on Indian Education (1882) and published historical studies including volumes on Orissa (1872) and biographical works on Lord Dalhousie and Lord Mayo. Hunter retired from the Indian Civil Service in 1887 with the honor KCSI (Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India) and died February 6, 1900, at Oaken Holt, England. His statistical methodologies and gazetteer format established templates that shaped colonial information-gathering practices throughout the British Empire.

## The Work

**Scope and Methodology:**

Hunter organized the volume into at least fifteen chapters covering physical geography, ethnographic classification, religious history, political chronology, and administrative structures. The work opens with "Physical Aspects," establishing the geographic framework, followed by demographic chapters including "The People," "The Non-Aryan Races," and "The Aryans in Ancient India." This ethnographic taxonomy reflects nineteenth-century racial classification systems prevalent in imperial scholarship, dividing populations according to linguistic and supposed biological descent categories.

The historical sections proceed chronologically: "Buddhism in India (543 B.C. to 1000 A.D.)," "The Greeks in India (327 to 161 B.C.)," "Scythic Inroads into India (126? B.C. to 544 A.D.)," "Rise of Hinduism (750 to 1520 A.D.)," "Christianity in India (circa 100 to 1881 A.D.)," "Early Muhammadan Rulers (711 to 1526 A.D.)," "The Mughal Empire (1526 to 1761 A.D.)," and "The Maratha Power (1634 to 1818 A.D.)." These chapters condense dynastic histories, territorial expansions, and administrative systems of successive Indian polities, framing them within a narrative progression toward British paramountcy.

Additional chapters address "The Indian Vernaculars and Their Literature," "Early European Settlements (1498 to 18th Century A.D.)," and "History of British Rule." The volume incorporates statistical tables on population distribution, agricultural production, trade volumes, revenue collections, and administrative divisions compiled from district-level surveys. Hunter included data on railways, irrigation systems, educational institutions, and postal networks, documenting British infrastructure development. The folding map provided territorial demarcation of British India's provinces, princely states, and administrative boundaries as constituted in the mid-1880s.

**Major Sections:**

The ethnographic chapters systematically catalog India's linguistic groups, tribal populations, and caste structures, presenting demographic data alongside descriptions of customs, occupations, and settlement patterns. Hunter employed census figures from the 1871 and 1881 enumerations, cross-referenced with district gazetteer materials. The sections on "The Non-Aryan Races" document tribal populations in Central Provinces, Bengal, Assam, and Burma, providing population estimates and ethnographic observations derived from administrative surveys.

Historical chapters synthesize dynastic chronologies with territorial maps showing successive political configurations. The section on "The Mughal Empire" details administrative divisions (subahs), revenue systems (jagir and mansabdari arrangements), and the empire's territorial extent at its zenith under Aurangzeb. "The Maratha Power" traces confederacy structures, the Peshwa administration, and Maratha expansion into northern and central India before British military campaigns (1775-1818) resulted in subsidiary alliances and territorial annexations.

Economic chapters analyze agricultural production—rice, wheat, cotton, indigo, opium, tea, jute—with acreage statistics and export values. Hunter documented mineral resources, including coal deposits in Bengal and Bihar, iron ore in Central Provinces, and salt production monopolies. Trade statistics enumerate imports (machinery, textiles, metals) and exports (raw cotton, opium, tea, wheat, jute) through major ports (Calcutta, Bombay, Madras), with values in sterling and rupees. Administrative sections describe provincial governance structures, district magistracies, revenue collection systems, judicial hierarchies, and the role of princely states under paramountcy arrangements.

## Significance

**Contemporary Reception:**

*The Indian Empire* functioned as a standard administrative reference throughout the late Victorian and Edwardian periods. The volume's condensation of statistical surveys into portable format made it essential for civil servants preparing for Indian postings or requiring quick reference on specific provinces. Educational institutions adopted the work as a textbook, particularly the 1895 revised edition, which gained widespread circulation in Indian schools. Hunter's reputation as the architect of the *Imperial Gazetteer* lent institutional authority to the volume's statistical claims and administrative descriptions.

The work exemplified late-nineteenth-century imperial information-gathering projects that sought to render colonial territories legible through quantification, classification, and systematization. Hunter's methodology—standardized district surveys, ethnographic taxonomy, statistical tables—influenced subsequent provincial gazetteers across British India and other colonial possessions. The volume's integration of geographic, demographic, economic, and historical data into a unified reference framework established a template for administrative handbooks, combining practical utility with scholarly apparatus.

**Later Assessment:**

Postcolonial scholarship has examined *The Indian Empire* as an artifact of Victorian imperial ideology, noting its teleological framing of Indian history as culminating in British rule. The ethnographic sections employ racial classification systems and hierarchical valuations of cultures that reflect nineteenth-century evolutionary anthropology. Hunter's treatment of the 1857 uprising, characterization of indigenous administrative systems as uniformly despotic, and emphasis on British infrastructural modernization articulate standard imperial justificatory narratives.

Despite ideological limitations, the work preserves valuable statistical data on 1880s British India otherwise scattered across provincial gazetteers and administrative reports. Economic historians have utilized Hunter's agricultural production figures, trade statistics, and revenue data to reconstruct late-nineteenth-century Indian economic conditions. Demographic data on linguistic distributions, urban populations, and caste enumerations provide baseline information for tracking social changes across the colonial and postcolonial periods. The volume's synthesis of district-level surveys offers comparative provincial perspectives difficult to obtain from individual gazetteer volumes.

**Value for Researchers:**

Contemporary scholars consult *The Indian Empire* primarily as a primary source documenting colonial knowledge production and administrative practices. The work illustrates how statistical surveys functioned as instruments of colonial governance, rendering populations, resources, and territories quantifiable and administratively manageable. Hunter's ethnographic classifications reveal Victorian assumptions about race, civilization, and social hierarchy embedded in ostensibly objective data collection.

For economic and social historians, the volume provides concentrated statistical evidence on agricultural production, trade patterns, urban development, and infrastructure expansion during a transformative period of Indian economic integration into global markets. The sections on administrative structures document provincial governance systems, revenue arrangements, and the subsidiary alliance framework governing relations with princely states. Comparison with earlier and later editions of the *Imperial Gazetteer* allows tracking of demographic shifts, economic changes, and territorial reorganizations across several decades of colonial rule.

Historians of science and information technology examine Hunter's statistical methodologies, standardization protocols, and data synthesis techniques as precedents for modern governmental information systems. The volume exemplifies nineteenth-century positivist approaches to social knowledge, assuming that systematic data collection and quantitative analysis could produce comprehensive, objective representations of complex societies. This epistemological framework shaped not only British colonial administration but also postcolonial state formation and developmental planning.
