## Historical Context

Ralph T. H. Griffith's 1893 English translation of the Samaveda represents a pivotal scholarly intervention in understanding the complex liturgical and musical traditions of ancient Indian Brahmanic culture. Compiled between 1200-1000 BCE during the late Vedic period, the Samaveda—literally "Veda of Melodies"—is a profound musical and ritual manuscript containing 1,875 verses predominantly sourced from the Rigveda, meticulously arranged for specific ritual performances, particularly the intricate Soma sacrifice. As the world's oldest surviving notated musical text, it provides unprecedented insight into the sophisticated sonic and spiritual practices of early Indian civilization. Griffith, a distinguished British Orientalist scholar, produced this landmark translation during the colonial era's intellectual project of documenting and interpreting classical Indian religious manuscripts, contributing significantly to cross-cultural academic understanding. The text's musical verses, designed to be chanted with precise melodic configurations, were not merely aesthetic expressions but integral components of complex Vedic religious ceremonies, reflecting a nuanced understanding of sound as a transformative spiritual medium. Each carefully structured chant served multiple functions: invoking divine entities, facilitating ritual processes, and maintaining cosmic harmony through precisely modulated sonic vibrations. Griffith's scholarly translation made these esoteric musical-religious practices accessible to Western academic audiences, bridging epistemological gaps between European scholarly traditions and Indian philosophical-musical heritage. By rendering these ancient Sanskrit texts into English, he enabled broader comprehension of the Samaveda's profound cultural significance, illuminating the intricate relationship between music, spirituality, and ritual in classical Indian intellectual traditions.

# Hymns of the Samaveda

## Overview

The Samaveda, translated into English by Ralph T. H. Griffith in 1893, stands as the third Veda in the canonical sequence and represents the musical dimension of Vedic liturgy. Known as the "Veda of Melodies" or "Veda of Chants," it occupies a unique position among the four Vedas through its primary function as a songbook for ritual performance rather than a collection of independent hymns.

Completed at Kotagiri in the Nilgiri Hills on May 25, 1893, Griffith's translation made accessible to English-speaking audiences this distinctive Vedic text whose original purpose lay not in reading but in melodic chanting during Soma sacrifices. The Samaveda comprises 1,875 verses organized into two main sections, with all but 75 verses derived from the Rigveda. However, this derivative character should not diminish recognition of the Samaveda's importance: its transformation of Rigvedic verses through musical elaboration created an independent ritual and aesthetic tradition that profoundly influenced Indian classical music.

The text contains what scholars recognize as probably the world's oldest surviving notated melodies, preserving a musical tradition extending back to the 2nd millennium BCE. This remarkable continuity makes the Samaveda invaluable for historians of music, comparative musicology, and understanding the ritual aesthetics of Vedic civilization.

## About Ralph T. H. Griffith

Ralph Thomas Hotchkin Griffith (1826-1906) completed his Samaveda translation relatively early in his systematic engagement with the four Vedas. Published in 1893, this work preceded his Atharvaveda translation (1895-1896) and appeared during the period when he was completing his Rigveda translation (1889-1896).

Born on May 25, 1826, Griffith served as a member of the Indian Education Service, gaining direct exposure to Sanskrit learning traditions and the living practice of Vedic recitation. His position in India provided access to pandits (traditional scholars) who maintained knowledge of Vedic chanting traditions, enriching his understanding beyond purely textual analysis.

The Samaveda presented distinctive challenges for translation. Unlike the Rigveda's poetic verses or the Atharvaveda's magical formulas, the Samaveda's essential character lay in its musical performance. Translating the textual content alone could not convey the tradition's core significance, which resided in melodic patterns, musical notation, and ritual performance contexts largely inaccessible to Western readers without direct exposure to the chanting tradition.

Despite these limitations, Griffith's translation made the Samaveda's textual dimension available in English, enabling scholars and interested readers to understand its liturgical function and relationship to the Rigveda. His work complemented his other Vedic translations, making him the first Western scholar to render all four Vedas into English, a comprehensive achievement demonstrating remarkable dedication to Sanskrit scholarship.

He died on November 7, 1906, leaving translations that continued to serve as standard English versions throughout much of the 20th century and remain accessible through digital repositories today.

## Structure and Organization

The Samaveda exists in multiple recensions (shakhas), with three main traditions surviving: Kauthuma, Jaiminiya, and Ranayaniya. Griffith's translation follows the Kauthuma recension, the most widely known and studied version. The text's structure differs significantly from other Vedas, reflecting its specialized liturgical function.

### Two-Part Division

The Samaveda divides into two primary sections, each serving distinct purposes within the ritual and pedagogical tradition:

**Purvarchika** (First Section): Also called the Archika, this portion contains 585 verses organized into six prapathaka (chapters). These verses constitute the basic repertoire from which ritual chants are constructed. Each verse appears in its fundamental form, providing the textual foundation for melodic elaboration.

**Uttararchika** (Second Section): This portion contains 1,225 verses organized into 21 prapathaka. It includes both verses from the Purvarchika appearing in different ritual contexts and additional verses completing the Samaveda's liturgical collection.

The distinction between these sections reflects pedagogical and ritual functions. The Purvarchika represents core material requiring memorization, while the Uttararchika encompasses the expanded repertoire employed in various ritual contexts.

### Additional Sections

Beyond the basic division, complete Samaveda manuscripts include:

**Samhita**: The collection of verses as described above, providing textual content for chanting.

**Brahmana**: Prose explanations of rituals, particularly the Tandya Mahabrahmana (also called Panchavimsha Brahmana), which details Soma sacrifice procedures and explicates the mystical significance of chants.

**Aranyaka**: The Chandogya Aranyaka and Jaiminiya Aranyaka contain esoteric teachings, meditation practices, and philosophical speculations.

**Upanishad**: The Chandogya Upanishad and Kena Upanishad, among the oldest and most important Upanishads, belong to the Samaveda tradition. The Chandogya Upanishad in particular contributed foundational concepts to Vedantic philosophy, including the doctrine "tat tvam asi" (thou art that).

Griffith's translation focused on the Samhita portion, the hymn collection itself, rather than the extensive supplementary literature that would require separate volumes for adequate treatment.

### Relationship to the Rigveda

Approximately 1,800 of the Samaveda's 1,875 verses derive from the Rigveda, primarily from Books 8 and 9, with particular emphasis on hymns to Soma Pavamana (purifying Soma) and Indra. Only 75 verses appear unique to the Samaveda, though even these often exhibit close parallels with Rigvedic material.

This derivative character initially led some Western scholars to dismiss the Samaveda as merely a Rigvedic appendix lacking independent significance. However, this assessment fundamentally misunderstood the text's purpose and achievement. The Samaveda's contribution lay not in original verse composition but in musical transformation of existing material for ritual purposes.

## Musical Character and Notation

The Samaveda's defining characteristic is its musical dimension, which distinguishes it fundamentally from the other three Vedas. While the Rigveda, Yajurveda, and Atharvaveda were recited with tonal accents (udatta, anudatta, svarita), the Samaveda required melodic chanting following elaborate musical patterns.

### Saman: The Ritual Melody

The term **saman** designates the melodic form into which Rigvedic verses (ric) were adapted for ritual chanting. This transformation involved several modifications:

**Prolongation**: Syllables extended to accommodate melodic movement, with single syllables sometimes sustained across multiple notes.

**Interpolation**: Non-lexical syllables inserted for melodic purposes, including the famous "stobha" syllables (hāu, hūm, etc.) that have no semantic meaning but serve musical functions.

**Repetition**: Words or phrases repeated to complete melodic patterns or emphasize ritual moments.

**Modification**: Original verse structure altered to fit prescribed melodic frameworks, sometimes reordering or omitting words.

These musical elaborations could transform a brief Rigvedic verse into an extended chant lasting several minutes, creating aesthetic and ritual effects fundamentally different from simple recitation.

### Musical Notation

The Samaveda texts contain notated melodies, representing probably the world's oldest surviving musical notation. This notation appears in two primary forms:

**Syllabic notation**: Written immediately above the text, indicating melodic movements through specialized syllables representing tonal positions and movements.

**Numerical notation**: Employing numbers to indicate svara (musical notes) corresponding to the seven-note scale (saptasvara) of Indian musical theory.

The notation system varies across different Samaveda shakhas (schools), reflecting regional and lineage variations in the chanting tradition. Despite these variations, the core melodic patterns maintain remarkable stability, enabling cross-referencing between different recensions.

However, translating this musical notation into Western staff notation or other systems remains challenging and contested. The Vedic tonal system, rhythmic structures, and performance practices differ significantly from Western musical conventions, making accurate transcription complex and often requiring extensive supplementary explanation.

### Continued Performance Tradition

Unlike many ancient musical traditions known only through theoretical descriptions or fragmentary notation, Samaveda chanting continues as living practice in contemporary India. Brahmin families maintaining unbroken lineages of Udgata priests preserve the chanting tradition through oral transmission, with musical patterns passed from teacher to student across generations.

This living tradition enables contemporary scholars to study Vedic music as performed practice rather than merely textual artifact. Ethnomusicological recordings and analyses have documented the chanting tradition, revealing its complexity, regional variations, and connections to later Indian classical music development.

UNESCO recognition of Vedic recitation as Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity acknowledges this tradition's unique cultural and historical significance, emphasizing the importance of preserving it amid contemporary social changes threatening traditional knowledge transmission systems.

## Ritual Context: The Soma Sacrifice

The Samaveda's primary ritual context is the Soma sacrifice, the elaborate ceremony wherein the sacred soma plant was pressed, purified, and offered to the gods, particularly Indra. This ritual represented Vedic religion's ceremonial pinnacle, requiring multiple days, extensive preparations, specialized knowledge, and the coordinated participation of numerous priests.

### Soma Ceremony Structure

The basic Soma sacrifice (Agnistoma) extended over multiple days, with more elaborate variants (including Atiratra, Aptoryama, and others) lasting weeks or months. The ceremony's central event involved pressing soma stalks between stones, filtering the juice through wool, mixing it with milk and other substances, and offering it to the gods while priests and patron consumed portions.

Three daily pressings marked the ritual's temporal structure: morning, midday, and evening. Each pressing required specific hymns, prayers, and musical performances coordinated with ritual actions. The Samaveda provided the melodic repertoire accompanying these ritual moments.

### The Udgata Priest

The Udgata priest, specialist in Samaveda chanting, held crucial responsibility for the musical dimension of Soma sacrifices. This priestly role formed one of the four primary ritual offices:

**Hotri** (from Rigveda): Recited invocations and praises calling deities to the sacrifice.

**Adhvaryu** (from Yajurveda): Performed physical ritual actions including altar construction, offering preparation, and oblation.

**Udgata** (from Samaveda): Chanted melodic hymns accompanying key ritual moments, particularly during soma pressing and purification.

**Brahma** (from Atharvaveda): Supervised the entire ceremony, correcting errors and ensuring ritual purity.

The Udgata did not work alone but led a team of assistants including the Prastota (who initiated chants), Pratiharta (who responded in antiphonal singing), and Subrahmanya (who supervised). This specialized division of musical labor created complex polyphonic effects during ritual performance.

### Ritual Symbolism

The Samaveda's chants possessed theological and cosmological significance beyond aesthetic function. The melodic elaboration transformed linguistic utterance into divine speech, creating sonic bridges between human and celestial realms. The vibrations produced through proper chanting were believed to maintain cosmic order, support the gods in their cosmic functions, and ensure sacrificial efficacy.

Specific melodies corresponded to particular deities, ritual moments, and cosmological principles. The Panchavimsha Brahmana and other texts elaborate these correspondences, explaining how musical elements (svara, rhythm, timbre) mapped onto cosmic realities (earth, atmosphere, heaven; past, present, future; etc.). This mystical musicology integrated acoustic phenomena into comprehensive Vedic cosmology.

## Major Themes and Deities

While the Samaveda's verses derive primarily from the Rigveda, its selection and arrangement emphasize particular themes and deities relevant to Soma sacrifice.

### Soma Pavamana

The purifying Soma receives dominant attention, with Book 9 of the Rigveda (entirely devoted to Soma Pavamana) providing the majority of Samaveda verses. These hymns accompanied the soma juice's filtering through wool, transforming botanical procedure into theological meditation on purification, transformation, and transcendence.

The soma's golden color, its flowing through the filter, its mixture with milk, and its consumption by gods and humans inspired elaborate poetic imagery: flowing rivers reaching the sea (representing the mixing vessel), bulls roaring (representing the crushing sound), clothing being purified (representing the filtering), and sun's light pervading space (representing the soma's divine radiance).

### Indra

As primary recipient of soma offerings, Indra receives extensive hymns celebrating his cosmic victory over Vritra and his continuing role as king of gods and cosmic maintainer. The Samaveda's Indra hymns emphasize his relationship with soma, which fortifies him for battle, sustains his divine power, and connects him to human worshippers through shared consumption of the sacred drink.

### Agni

The sacrificial fire receives significant attention as the medium through which offerings reach celestial recipients. Agni's multiple manifestations (terrestrial fire, lightning, sun) and his role as divine priest and messenger connect him intimately to sacrificial theology.

### Savitar and Other Deities

Savitar (the solar stimulator), Ushas (Dawn), Ashvins (divine physicians), and other deities receive hymns in contexts appropriate to specific ritual moments. The selection reflects liturgical requirements rather than representing comprehensive Vedic theology.

## Philosophical Connections

The Samaveda tradition contributed significantly to Indian philosophical development through its associated Upanishads, particularly the Chandogya Upanishad, one of the oldest and most influential Upanishadic texts.

### Chandogya Upanishad

This text, belonging to the Samaveda tradition, contains foundational Vedantic concepts including:

**Tat tvam asi** ("Thou art that"): The famous mahavakya (great saying) expressing identity between individual self (atman) and ultimate reality (brahman), constituting a core doctrine of Advaita Vedanta.

**Prana vidya**: Teachings on vital breath (prana) as connecting principle between individual and cosmos, influencing later yoga philosophy.

**Musical mysticism**: Elaboration of sacred syllable OM as representing all existence, with detailed analysis of its three components (A-U-M) and their cosmic correspondences. This OM mysticism profoundly influenced subsequent Indian spiritual traditions.

**Cosmological meditation**: Instructions for meditating on cosmic principles through ritual elements, connecting sacrificial practice to contemplative discipline.

The Chandogya Upanishad's integration of musical mysticism, cosmological meditation, and philosophical non-dualism demonstrates how the Samaveda tradition transcended purely ritual concerns to contribute to Indian metaphysical thought.

## Influence on Indian Classical Music

The Samaveda established foundational concepts that shaped the development of Indian classical music across subsequent millennia. While direct continuity remains debated, several connections are clear:

### Scale Structure

The seven-note scale (saptasvara) referenced in later Samaveda literature corresponds to the sa-re-ga-ma-pa-dha-ni system of Indian classical music. While the precise tuning and intervals may have evolved, the basic heptatonic framework shows continuity from Vedic to classical periods.

### Raga Concept

The idea of melodic frameworks (jati in early texts, later developing into raga) with specific emotional characters, appropriate performance times, and prescribed note sequences may trace ancestry to Samaveda melodic categories. Though the elaborate raga system developed later, its seeds appear in Vedic musical thinking.

### Spiritual Musicology

The conception of music as spiritual discipline rather than mere entertainment, with specific melodies possessing cosmic correspondences and transformative power, pervades Indian classical music and reflects Vedic origins. The integration of aesthetic, ritual, and spiritual dimensions in musical performance continues patterns established in Samaveda tradition.

### Guru-Shishya Transmission

The oral transmission system wherein musical knowledge passes from teacher (guru) to student (shishya) through direct instruction and imitation, without reliance on written notation, continues Vedic pedagogical methods. This transmission mode preserves subtle performance nuances impossible to capture in notation.

## Translation Challenges

Translating the Samaveda presented Griffith with distinctive challenges beyond those encountered with other Vedic texts. The fundamental problem was that the text's essential character lay in musical performance, which textual translation could not capture.

### Loss of Musical Dimension

Rendering Samaveda verses into English prose or poetry inevitably lost the musical elaboration that constituted their primary significance. The stobha syllables (hāu, hūm, etc.), crucial for melodic structure, became meaningless in translation. The prolongations, repetitions, and modifications that adapted verses to musical patterns disappeared, leaving only the underlying Rigvedic verses.

Griffith acknowledged this limitation in his introduction, noting that "the Sāma Veda...is of little importance except to the student of Indian music" without access to the melodic tradition. His translation focused on textual content while recognizing the incompleteness inherent in this approach.

### Derivative Content

Since most Samaveda verses derive from the Rigveda, translation risked appearing redundant for readers already familiar with Rigvedic material. Griffith addressed this by providing cross-references to Rigvedic sources while emphasizing the Samaveda's distinctive liturgical function and organization.

### Specialized Terminology

The text's musical and ritual terminology required technical knowledge for accurate rendering. Terms referring to specific melodic patterns, ritual moments, and priestly functions lacked English equivalents, necessitating either transliteration with explanation or approximate translation potentially obscuring precise meaning.

Despite these challenges, Griffith's translation made the Samaveda accessible to English readers, enabling scholarly study of its structure, deity selection, and liturgical function even without access to the musical tradition.

## Scholarly Significance

The Samaveda's importance for scholarship extends across multiple disciplines:

### History of Music

As containing probably the world's oldest notated melodies, the text provides unique evidence for ancient musical practice. Comparative musicologists studying the development of musical notation, scale systems, and performance traditions regularly reference Samaveda material.

### Ritual Studies

The text illuminates how Vedic sacrifices integrated multiple sensory dimensions (visual, olfactory, tactile, auditory) into comprehensive ritual aesthetics. The musical elaboration demonstrates sophisticated understanding of sound's emotional, psychological, and spiritual effects.

### Indo-European Studies

Comparative analysis reveals parallels between Vedic soma rituals and Iranian haoma ceremonies, suggesting shared Indo-Iranian musical and ritual traditions. Broader Indo-European comparisons identify potential connections to Greek musical theory, though direct relationships remain speculative.

### Indian Cultural History

The Samaveda's influence on Indian classical music, its contribution to Upanishadic philosophy, and its continuing role in ritual practice demonstrate cultural continuity across three millennia. Understanding this continuity requires engaging with Samaveda tradition in both historical and contemporary contexts.
