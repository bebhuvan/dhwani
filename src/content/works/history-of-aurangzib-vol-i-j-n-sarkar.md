# History of Aurangzib

## Overview

Published in five volumes between 1912-1924, Jadunath Sarkar's *History of Aurangzib* represents a landmark in Indian historiography—the first comprehensive scholarly biography of a Mughal emperor based on exhaustive archival research by an Indian historian. Sarkar mastered Persian, consulted Marathi chronicles, examined European travelers' accounts, and correlated diverse sources to reconstruct Aurangzib's fifty-year reign (1658-1707), arguably the most consequential and controversial in Mughal history.

The volumes trace Aurangzib's rise from third son to emperor through brutal wars of succession, his expansion of Mughal territory to encompass nearly the entire subcontinent, his religious policies favoring Islamic orthodoxy over Akbar's syncretism, his decades-long Deccan campaigns that exhausted imperial resources, and the empire's decline as regional powers (Marathas, Sikhs, Rajputs) gained strength. Sarkar presented Aurangzib as complex figure—personally pious and administratively competent yet politically ruthless and religiously intolerant, brilliant strategist who overextended the empire he sought to strengthen.

The work established Indian historical scholarship's credibility, demonstrating that rigorous, source-based historiography was not exclusively Western domain but could be produced by Indian scholars engaging their own past with professional methodology.

## About Jadunath Sarkar (1870-1958)

Born in Bengal to zamindar family with substantial library, Jadunath Sarkar developed early love of learning. Graduating from Presidency College, Calcutta (1891) with MA in English (1892), he joined academia, teaching English literature and history while pursuing historical research. He mastered Persian—essential for Mughal sources—and studied Marathi to access chronicles of Maratha-Mughal conflicts.

Sarkar's scholarship combined rigorous European historical methodology (learned through British academic training) with linguistic competence enabling direct engagement with Indian-language sources. Unlike British historians dependent on translations, Sarkar read Persian chronicles, farmans (imperial orders), and Marathi bakhars in original languages, catching nuances and contradictions invisible to non-specialist translators.

His major works—*History of Aurangzib* (5 volumes, 1912-1924), *Shivaji and His Times* (1919), *Fall of the Mughal Empire* (4 volumes, 1932-1950), and numerous studies of Mughal administration, military history, and provincial developments—established him as preeminent authority on Mughal India. He served as Vice-Chancellor of Calcutta University (1926-1928), received knighthood (1929), and became Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire.

Historians credited Sarkar with establishing "tradition of honest and scholarly historiography" in India. His insistence on primary source research, cross-referencing contradictory accounts, acknowledging uncertainties, and avoiding nationalist hagiography or colonial apologetics set standards for subsequent Indian historians.

## Aurangzib's Reign and Historical Significance

Aurangzib (Muhi-ud-Din Muhammad, 1618-1707) ruled during Mughal Empire's territorial zenith yet sowed seeds of its decline:

**Wars of Succession (1657-1659)**: When Shah Jahan fell ill, his four sons—Dara Shikoh, Shuja, Murad, and Aurangzib—fought for the throne. Sarkar documented this brutal struggle, analyzing military strategies, political alliances, and the decisive battles (Samugarh, Khajwa, Deorai) that secured Aurangzib's victory. He imprisoned his father Shah Jahan (who died in captivity viewing the Taj Mahal) and executed his brothers—ruthlessness Sarkar examined as both political necessity in Mughal succession politics and indication of Aurangzib's character.

**Religious Policy**: Aurangzib reversed Akbar's religious tolerance, reimposing jizya (tax on non-Muslims), destroying Hindu temples (Kashi Vishwanath, Somnath, and others), restricting Hindu festival celebrations, and promoting Islamic law. Sarkar meticulously documented these policies through farmans and chronicles while analyzing motivations—religious conviction versus political strategy to consolidate orthodox Muslim support. This remains most controversial aspect of Aurangzib's legacy, with nationalist historians emphasizing persecution and revisionist scholars questioning extent and motivations.

**Deccan Campaigns (1681-1707)**: Aurangzib spent his final twenty-six years campaigning in the Deccan, conquering Bijapur and Golconda sultanates but failing to suppress Maratha guerrilla resistance. Sarkar's detailed military history showed how protracted warfare drained imperial treasury, disrupted administration, enabled provincial autonomy, and exhausted the aging emperor. The Deccan became Mughal graveyard—territorial gains proved pyrrhic as empire's centralized control collapsed.

**Administrative Competence**: Despite religious intolerance and military overextension, Aurangzib proved capable administrator—personally reviewing accounts, maintaining revenue systems, supervising provincial governors, and enforcing law. Sarkar documented the emperor's legendary austerity (he lived simply, copied Qurans for income, avoided luxuries) and tireless work ethic, presenting complex portrait of austere puritan whose virtues paradoxically undermined empire by alienating subjects and allies.

## Historical Methodology and Source Base

Sarkar's revolutionary contribution was methodological rigor applied to Mughal history. Previous works—whether British administrative histories or Persian court chronicles—lacked systematic source criticism, comparative analysis, and archival comprehensiveness.

**Persian Chronicles**: Sarkar consulted dozens of contemporary Persian histories—Alamgir-nama, Muntakhab al-Lubab, Maasir-i-Alamgiri, and others—comparing accounts, identifying biases (court historians glorifying patron), and extracting reliable information from hagiographic rhetoric.

**Marathi Sources**: He examined Marathi bakhars and letters documenting Maratha perspective on Mughal-Maratha conflicts, correcting one-sided Mughal narratives and revealing how regional powers viewed imperial expansion.

**European Accounts**: French, Dutch, English, and Italian travelers and merchants (Manucci, Bernier, Tavernier) provided outsider perspectives on Mughal court, military campaigns, and economic conditions—valuable for corroborating or questioning Indian sources.

**Farmans and Documents**: Sarkar studied original imperial orders, revenue records, and administrative correspondence preserved in archives—primary sources revealing policy implementation versus idealized chronicle descriptions.

This multi-source approach enabled balanced, nuanced history—acknowledging contradictions, questioning received narratives, and constructing detailed chronology verified through cross-referencing.

## Nationalist Context and Historical Debates

Sarkar wrote during intense nationalist ferment (1910s-1920s). His work navigated complex political terrain: presenting Indian history seriously to demonstrate civilization's sophistication while avoiding both colonial apologetics (justifying British rule as improvement over "despotic" Mughals) and nationalist hagiography (romanticizing pre-colonial past).

His balanced portrait of Aurangzib—acknowledging both achievements and failings—drew criticism from multiple sides. Some Hindu nationalists wanted stronger condemnation of temple destruction and jizya; some Muslims objected to criticism of orthodox emperor. British officials sometimes viewed detailed Mughal administrative history as implicit criticism of colonial governance.

Yet Sarkar maintained scholarly integrity, insisting historians must follow sources wherever they led, acknowledging uncertainty where evidence conflicted, and resisting political pressure to distort historical record. This commitment established Indian academic history's independence from political agendas—essential foundation for professional historiography.

## Legacy and Continuing Influence

Sarkar's *History of Aurangzib* remained standard reference for decades. Subsequent scholars—both Indian and international—built on his documentary foundations, though many challenged interpretations. Modern historians question his occasionally Victorian moral judgments, insufficient attention to economic and social history versus political narrative, and limited engagement with Aurangzib's internal psychology versus external actions.

Post-independence debates about secularism, religious tolerance, and India's composite culture repeatedly invoke Aurangzib as symbol—of either Islamic intolerance requiring secular counterbalance or communal propaganda distorting complex ruler. Sarkar's work, with its detailed documentation, remains essential reference point, though scholars recognize he wrote within particular historical moment's frameworks and assumptions.

For historiographical scholarship, Sarkar demonstrated that rigorous archival history could be produced by non-Western historians about their own civilizations—challenging colonial monopoly on "scientific" history and establishing indigenous scholarly traditions that would flourish post-independence.
