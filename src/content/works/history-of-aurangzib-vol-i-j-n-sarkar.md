description: "Published in five volumes between 1912-1924, Jadunath Sarkar's *History of Aurangzib* represents a landmark in Indian historiography—the first comprehensive scholarly biography of a Mughal emperor based on exhaustive archival research by an Indian historian. wars of succession, expansion of Mughal territory to its greatest extent, religious policies (including temple destruction and jizya reimposition), decades-long Deccan campaigns, and the empire's eventual overextension. Sarkar presented balanced portrait—neither hagiography nor demonization—examining Aurangzib's administrative competence, personal austerity, strategic acumen, and the contradictions between Islamic orthodoxy and imperial pragmatism. This first comprehensive scholarly history by an Indian historian established standards for archival research and source-critical methodology in Indian historiography."
