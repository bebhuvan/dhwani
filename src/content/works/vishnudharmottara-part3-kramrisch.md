# The Viṣṇudharmottara Purāṇa (Part III)

## Overview

Part III of the Viṣṇudharmottara Purāṇa, translated by renowned art historian Stella Kramrisch (1928), is one of ancient India's earliest and most authoritative technical treatises on painting (chitra-vidya) and image-making (pratima-lakshana). This section contains detailed chitrasutras (aphorisms on painting) that established foundational principles for Indian pictorial arts.

The text systematically covers pramana (proportional measurement systems for figures), techniques of brush work and line drawing, preparation and application of colors (including mineral and vegetable pigments), composition principles governing spatial arrangement, and detailed iconographic lakshanas specifying how deities should be depicted (postures, attributes, colors, ornaments). These technical specifications influenced subsequent painting traditions across India, from manuscript illumination to temple murals to miniature painting schools. Stella Kramrisch's translation made this foundational text accessible to modern scholars. Essential for understanding the theoretical and technical basis of Indian painting beyond stylistic analysis.
