  The Great Indian Epics by John Campbell Oman represents a pioneering scholarly effort to introduce English-speaking audiences to India's two foundational epic texts—the Ramayana and the Mahabharata—which together constitute the cornerstone of Indian literary, religious, and cultural tradition. These monumental Sanskrit epics, composed over centuries during the first millennium BCE, stand among humanity's longest and most influential narrative works, containing philosophical teachings, moral precepts, and mythological narratives that have profoundly shaped the civilization of the Indian subcontinent for over two millennia. The Ramayana, traditionally attributed to the sage Valmiki, narrates the heroic journey of Prince Rama in his quest to rescue his wife Sita from the demon king Ravana, embodying ideals of dharma (righteous duty), devotion, and moral conduct. The Mahabharata, attributed to Vyasa, recounts the epic conflict between the Pandava and Kaurava clans, culminating in the catastrophic Kurukshetra war, while incorporating the Bhagavad Gita—one of Hinduism's most sacred philosophical texts—as a central discourse on duty, spirituality, and the nature of existence.

  Oman's scholarly survey examines how these epics function as comprehensive repositories of Indian cultural knowledge, transmitting religious beliefs, social values, ethical frameworks, and cosmological understandings across generations. The narrative structures of both epics employ complex nested storytelling techniques, frame narratives, and extensive interpolations that create vast literary universes encompassing divine intervention, heroic action, philosophical reflection, and moral instruction. Key themes explored include the tension between fate and free will, the complexities of dharma in ambiguous situations, the nature of kingship and governance, the power of devotion and sacrifice, and the eternal struggle between cosmic order and chaos. These epics have profoundly influenced subsequent Indian literature, inspiring countless regional retellings, adaptations, and artistic interpretations across languages, theatrical traditions, dance forms, painting, sculpture, and contemporary media. Their narratives provide foundational archetypes, moral exemplars, and philosophical frameworks that continue to inform Indian ethical reasoning, social relationships, and cultural identity. For scholars and general readers seeking to understand Indian civilization, these epics remain indispensable texts whose themes, characters, and teachings continue to resonate throughout South Asian cultural and religious life, representing living traditions rather than merely historical artifacts.
