description: "The Tirumantiram represents Tamil Shaiva Siddhanta's foundational text and among Tamil devotional literature's philosophical masterworks, comprising 3,047 verses systematizing Shaiva philosophy, Yoga practice, Tantra, and devotional theology. Composed around 5th-7th century CE by siddha Tirumular, this monumental work of nine sections (tantras) integrates diverse traditions: Shaiva metaphysics presenting Shiva as ultimate reality, Yoga's eight-limbed path adapted to Shaiva context, Tantric practices including kundalini yoga and chakra meditation, and intense devotion (bhakti) toward Shiva. The text addresses Shiva's nature as transcendent-immanent, soul (pasu) bound by impurities (mala) requiring divine grace (arul) and practice (sadhana) for liberation, and spiritual evolution through progressive realization culminating in Shiva-identity. Beyond theological exposition, Tirumular presents sophisticated psychology analyzing consciousness, detailed physiology of subtle body (nadis, chakras, kundalini), ethical teachings, and practical instructions for meditation-worship. The work profoundly influenced Tamil Shaivism as authoritative scripture alongside Tevaram, demonstrating Tamil philosophy's sophistication and Shaiva Siddhanta's systematic theological-philosophical development."
