# Maha-bharata: The Epic of Ancient India Condensed into English Verse

## Overview

"Maha-bharata" by Romesh Chunder Dutt is an epic poem that condenses the ancient Indian epic into English verse, written in the late 19th century. This work dives deep into themes of duty, morality, and the struggles of its characters, particularly focusing on the events surrounding the Kuru dynasty, including the rivalry between the Pandavas and Kauravas.

## Epic Structure

The opening presents the backdrop of the ancient kingdom of the Kurus and introduces the key players in the narrative. It describes relationships between the brothers Pandu and Dhrita-rashtra, alongside their sons, establishing a tense atmosphere of competition and jealousy. The rivalry between the noble Pandavas and the ambitious Duryodhan sets the stage for conflict, while a tournament showcases the prowess of the princes, highlighting the emerging talents of Arjun and the mysterious Karna.

## Thematic Depth

The work weaves in themes of destiny, valor, and the divine lineage of these characters. As tensions build, the stage is set for the ensuing conflicts that will shape the destiny of both families and the epic's overarching narrative of duty, honor, and moral complexity.
