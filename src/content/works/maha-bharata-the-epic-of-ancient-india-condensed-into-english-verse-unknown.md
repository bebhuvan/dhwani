description: 'At the turn of the 20th century, during a critical period of colonial
  intellectual discourse and emerging nationalist consciousness, Romesh Chunder Dutt''s
  English verse translation of the Mahabharata represented a pivotal scholarly intervention
  in Indian literary and cultural historiography. A distinguished Bengali intellectual,
  civil servant, and early nationalist leader, Dutt undertook this comprehensive translation
  as part of a broader intellectual movement to reframe classical Indian textual traditions
  for both indigenous and metropolitan audiences. Published in 1900, his work emerged
  during a transformative moment when Indian scholars were actively challenging colonial
  epistemological frameworks by presenting indigenous narratives through sophisticated
  literary translations. Dutt''s translation condenses the massive Sanskrit epic—traditionally
  comprising over 100,000 verses—into an accessible English poetic rendering that
  preserves the philosophical depth and narrative complexity of the original text.
  By focusing on the fundamental conflict between the Pandava and Kaurava royal lineages,
  the translation explores profound philosophical themes of dharma (ethical duty),
  familial loyalty, individual moral choices, and the complex dynamics of political
  power and cosmic destiny. Critically, Dutt''s work was not merely a linguistic translation
  but a cultural mediation, strategically presenting the Mahabharata''s intricate
  moral universe to challenge prevailing colonial representations of Indian civilization
  as philosophically unsophisticated. His scholarly approach simultaneously served
  nationalist intellectual goals of cultural recuperation and provided Western readers
  a nuanced entry point into one of humanity''s most sophisticated philosophical-narrative
  traditions. The translation thus represents a landmark moment in comparative literary
  scholarship, bridging indigenous textual traditions with emerging transnational
  intellectual dialogues.
