# Outlines of Indian Philosophy

## Overview

Originally published in Berlin in 1907, this philosophical treatise systematically outlines major schools of Indian philosophy for Western audiences. Deussen examines Vedic thought, Upanishadic philosophy, and various darshanas, with a substantial appendix comparing Vedanta metaphysics with Western philosophical traditions, particularly Schopenhauer's idealism. Written by a Western philosopher trained in European universities, Deussen's work represents an early twentieth-century effort to integrate Indian philosophical systems into comparative philosophy.

## About Paul Deussen

Paul Jakob Deussen (1845-1919) was a German Indologist and professor of philosophy at the University of Kiel. A close friend of Friedrich Nietzsche and Swami Vivekananda, Deussen was profoundly influenced by Arthur Schopenhauer's philosophy. He founded the Schopenhauer Society in 1911 and served as the first editor of the Schopenhauer Yearbook from 1912. Deussen is recognized as one of the first Western philosophers to systematically include Eastern philosophical thought in comprehensive histories of philosophy.

## Historical Context

Published originally by Karl Curtius in Berlin in 1907, this work emerged during a period of growing European academic interest in Indian philosophy. The Archive.org edition represents a 1976 reprint by Ess Ess Publications in Delhi. Deussen's work appeared alongside increasing translation activity of Sanskrit philosophical texts and represented serious philosophical engagement with Indian thought rather than mere orientalist cataloging.

## Philosophical Significance

This concise work (approximately 92 pages in the reprint edition) provides systematic exposition of Indian philosophical schools accessible to Western philosophical audiences. Deussen's comparative approach, particularly in the appendix examining Vedanta-Western metaphysics relationships, reflected his conviction that Indian philosophy deserved serious consideration alongside Greek and European traditions. His friendship with Swami Vivekananda and grounding in Schopenhauer's philosophy informed his interpretive approach.

## Content and Structure

The work examines:
- Vedic philosophical foundations
- Upanishadic thought and central doctrines
- Major darshanas (philosophical schools)
- Systematic presentation of Indian metaphysics
- Appendix on Vedanta philosophy in relation to Western metaphysics
- Comparative analysis with Schopenhauer's idealism

## Digital Preservation

The 1976 reprint edition has been digitized from the University of Toronto's Robarts Library collection and is freely available through the Internet Archive. Multiple editions from different publishers remain in circulation, testifying to the work's enduring relevance in comparative philosophy studies.
