# Historical View of Plans for the Government of British India

## Overview
Serving as historiographer to the East India Company, John Bruce compiled this 1793 treatise to track the succession of plans advanced for managing the Company’s territories and commerce. He digests proposals from parliamentary committees, reform pamphlets, and Company memorials in order to assess how policy-makers attempted to reconcile profit, regulation, and territorial control.

## Highlights
Bruce summarises debates surrounding the Regulating Act, Warren Hastings’s impeachment, the India Bills of Fox and Pitt, and competing monopolies on Asian trade. He reproduces extracts from confidential minutes, critiques ideas for a supervisory board in London, and outlines his own recommendation for a structured chain of authority linking presidencies to the metropolitan government.

## Access Notes
The Internet Archive edition includes the original half-title and extensive marginal annotations, with OCR search that helps researchers trace each cited scheme or legislative proposal.
