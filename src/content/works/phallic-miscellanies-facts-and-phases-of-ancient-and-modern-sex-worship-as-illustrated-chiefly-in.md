description: '"Phallic Miscellanies" by Hargrave Jennings is a scholarly work that
  delves into the topic of ancient and modern sex worship, particularly focusing on
  phallic worship within the religious practices of India. Written in the late 19th
  century, this book serves as a supplementary text to Jennings'' previous works on
  phallism and nature worship, providing an intricate examination of symbols and rituals
  from Hinduism and how they connect to broader themes of procreation and divinity.  At
  the start of the work, Jennings sets the stage for a detailed exploration of the
  Linga, a significant object in Hindu worship symbolizing creation and fertility.
  He describes how the Linga puja, or worship of the phallic symbol, is a long-standing
  tradition in India, involving various rituals performed by devotees seeking blessings
  for fertility and marital success. The author begins to examine the significance
  of the Linga alongside an exploration of other deities like Siva within the Hindu
  pantheon, illustrating a complex interplay of mythology, symbolism, and cultural
  practices related to phallic worship. This opening portion establishes a foundation
  for the in-depth discussions that follow, centering on the historical and spiritual
  dimensions of phallic reverence in Indian religions.'
