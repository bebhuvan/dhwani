description: "The Charaka Samhita stands as ancient India's foundational text of internal medicine and medical philosophy, systematizing Ayurvedic knowledge through approximately 12,000 verses covering etiology, symptomatology, diagnosis, therapeutics, pharmacology, toxicology, and medical ethics. Composed around 2nd century BCE and completed by Dridhabala in 4th century CE, this monumental work of eight sthanas (sections) presents comprehensive medical science: tridosha theory (vata-pitta-kapha humors), detailed disease classification, diagnostic methodologies including pulse examination, extensive pharmacological knowledge with 500+ medicinal substances, dietary therapy, preventive medicine, and physician training. Beyond technical medicine, Charaka presents profound medical philosophy: health as harmony between body, mind, and environment; disease as imbalance requiring holistic treatment; physician as scientist-philosopher-healer; and medicine's ultimate goal as promoting longevity and quality of life enabling dharmic living. The text influenced Indian medical tradition profoundly while contributing to global medicine through Arabic translations, demonstrating ancient India's sophisticated approach to health, disease, and healing."
