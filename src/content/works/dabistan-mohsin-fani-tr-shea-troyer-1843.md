  The Dabistán, or School of Manners represents a pivotal 17th-century Persian comparative religious treatise documenting the complex religious landscape of Mughal India during a period of profound intellectual and spiritual negotiation. Composed between 1645-1658, the work provides a comprehensive survey of twelve distinct religious traditions prevalent in the Mughal Empire and Middle Eastern regions, including nuanced examinations of Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, and emerging traditions like early Sikhism. While scholarly debates continue regarding its precise authorship—traditionally attributed to Mohsin Fani—the text is recognized as a critical anthropological and philosophical document that illuminates the sophisticated religious pluralism characterizing Mughal intellectual culture. The work's significance extends beyond mere descriptive documentation, offering critical insights into theological interactions, syncretistic religious movements like Emperor Akbar's Din-i Ilahi, and the intellectual exchanges occurring at the intersection of diverse spiritual traditions. Its methodological approach, which emphasizes comparative understanding and scholarly neutrality, was remarkably progressive for its historical context, presenting each religious tradition with analytical depth and comparative respect. The 1843 English translation by David Shea and Anthony Troyer through the Oriental Translation Fund made this invaluable manuscript accessible to European orientalist scholarship, subsequently establishing its importance in cross-cultural religious studies. As a historical artifact, the Dabistán provides scholars with an unprecedented window into the theological complexities, philosophical negotiations, and religious dynamism of seventeenth-century South Asian intellectual environments, demonstrating the remarkable cosmopolitan ethos of Mughal scholarly discourse.

# The Dabistán, or School of Manners

## Overview

The Dabistān-i Maẕāhib ("School of Religious Sects") stands as one of the most remarkable documents of religious pluralism from Mughal India. Composed in Persian between 1645-1658, this comprehensive comparative survey examines twelve religious traditions practiced in India, Persia, and the broader Islamic world, offering detailed descriptions of their beliefs, practices, and philosophical foundations. The work reflects the extraordinary religious diversity and intellectual cosmopolitanism of 17th-century Mughal society, where Muslim, Hindu, Zoroastrian, Christian, Jewish, and syncretic traditions coexisted and interacted.

What makes the Dabistān particularly valuable is its documentation of religious movements and practices that left few other textual traces—most notably early Sikhism (then only a few decades old) and Emperor Akbar's Din-i Ilahi (Divine Faith), a syncretic religion that barely outlasted its founder. The author's approach combines ethnographic observation with philosophical analysis, treating each tradition with remarkable (for its era) religious tolerance and intellectual curiosity.

David Shea and Anthony Troyer's 1843 English translation, published by London's Oriental Translation Fund, introduced European scholars to this unique text during a period of intensifying orientalist scholarship and comparative religious studies.

## Authorship Question

The text is traditionally attributed to **Mohsin Fani** (also Mohsan Fani), identified in some manuscripts as a Kashmiri Persian who may have been Zoroastrian by background and sympathetic to Sufism. However, modern scholarship has contested this attribution based on manuscript analysis and internal evidence.

Contemporary researchers suggest the author may have been **Mīr Ḏū'lfiqār Ardestānī** (also known as Mollah Mowbad), a Persian scholar with Zoroastrian connections who lived in India during the mid-17th century. Manuscript variations, stylistic analysis, and biographical inconsistencies have led scholars to question the Mohsin Fani attribution, though it remains conventional in many references.

Regardless of precise authorship, the text clearly emerges from someone with:
- Deep knowledge of Persian, Sanskrit, and Islamic scholarly traditions
- Personal contact with practitioners of diverse religions
- Philosophical training enabling comparative analysis
- Access to Mughal court circles and religious communities
- Sympathy for religious pluralism unusual in the confessional age

The author's religious affiliation remains debated—possibly Zoroastrian, possibly Sufi Muslim, possibly syncretic—which may have enabled the unusual detachment with which diverse traditions are presented.

## Historical Context

The Dabistān was composed during the later Mughal period, following the pluralistic reign of Akbar (1556-1605) but before the more orthodox Islamic policies of Aurangzeb (1658-1707). This transitional period saw:

**Religious Diversity**: Multiple religious traditions flourished under varying degrees of imperial patronage and tolerance. Akbar's promotion of religious dialogue through his Ibadat Khana (House of Worship) had created an intellectual environment where comparative religious discussion was possible.

**Philosophical Syncretism**: Attempts to synthesize Islamic, Hindu, and other traditions produced movements like Din-i Ilahi, Dara Shikoh's efforts to find commonalities between Vedanta and Sufism, and various devotional (bhakti) movements.

**Political Transitions**: The succession struggle following Shah Jahan's illness (1657) would soon result in Aurangzeb's triumph and shift toward Sunni orthodoxy, making the Dabistān a document of a religious tolerance that was already beginning to fade.

**Zoroastrian Communities**: Persian Zoroastrian refugees (Parsees) were establishing themselves in Gujarat and maintaining connections with their Iranian homeland, creating transnational religious networks.

## Structure and Content

The work examines twelve religious systems in separate books:

### 1. Parsis (Zoroastrianism)
Extensive treatment of Zoroastrian theology, cosmology, angelology, ethical dualism, ritual practices, and priestly traditions. Reflects detailed insider knowledge, supporting theories of Zoroastrian authorship.

### 2. Mu'tazilites and Karamites
Islamic theological schools emphasizing reason and God's justice, representing rationalist trends in Islamic thought.

### 3. Shi'as
Shia Islamic doctrines, particularly regarding the Imamate, theological positions, and ritual practices.

### 4. Sunnis
Sunni Islamic theology, law schools, and mainstream Muslim beliefs and practices in the Mughal context.

### 5. Sufis
Sufi orders, mystical practices, philosophical positions, and prominent saints, documenting Islamic mysticism's diversity.

### 6. Philosophers (Hukama)
Islamic philosophical traditions incorporating Aristotelian, Neoplatonic, and indigenous developments.

### 7. Hindus
Hindu philosophical schools, sectarian divisions (Shaiva, Vaishnava, Shakta), yogic practices, and beliefs. Notable for attempting to understand Hindu traditions from within rather than simply dismissing them.

### 8. Buddhists and Jains
Brief treatment of Buddhist and Jain traditions as encountered in India.

### 9. Jews
Jewish beliefs and practices as observed in Persia and India, including Karaite and Rabbinical traditions.

### 10. Christians
Christianity as practiced in Persia and encountered through European missionaries, including theological controversies.

### 11. Din-i Ilahi (Divine Faith)
Detailed account of Akbar's syncretic religion, combining elements from multiple traditions into a new synthesis. This section provides invaluable historical information about a movement that left few other records.

### 12. Sikhs
Early Sikh tradition under the first six Gurus, providing crucial historical evidence about Sikhism when it was only several decades old. Documents beliefs, practices, and the Gurus' teachings as understood by a non-Sikh observer.

## Methodological Approach

The Dabistān employs several distinctive approaches:

**Comparative Framework**: Rather than defending one tradition against others, the text presents multiple systems as legitimate paths deserving serious consideration.

**Ethnographic Detail**: Descriptions include observed practices, rituals, social organization, and lived religion, not just theological abstractions.

**Philosophical Analysis**: Each tradition's metaphysical, epistemological, and ethical positions receive systematic examination.

**Historical Awareness**: The text notes traditions' historical development, internal diversity, and contemporary manifestations.

**Relative Tolerance**: While the author has clear preferences, the tone generally avoids hostile polemic common in confessional religious writing of the era.

This methodology prefigures modern comparative religious studies, though within the framework of 17th-century Persian philosophical discourse.

## Significance for Religious History

The Dabistān's historical value extends across multiple areas:

**Sikhism**: One of the earliest detailed external accounts of Sikh beliefs and practices, documenting the tradition before substantial later developments. Provides information about early Sikh communities, the Adi Granth, and the Gurus' teachings.

**Din-i Ilahi**: Almost sole surviving detailed account of Akbar's syncretic movement, which left few other textual records. Documents its theological principles, rituals, and adherents.

**Zoroastrianism**: Preserves Persian Zoroastrian traditions and demonstrates connections between Iranian and Indian Parsee communities.

**Hindu-Muslim Interaction**: Documents religious exchange, mutual influence, and comparative understanding across communal boundaries.

**Mughal Religious Culture**: Reveals the intellectual atmosphere of Mughal India's religiously plural society at its zenith.

## The 1843 Translation

**David Shea** was an orientalist and translator who died before completing the work. **Anthony Troyer** completed and published the translation through the Oriental Translation Fund of Great Britain and Ireland (later the Royal Asiatic Society).

Published in Paris in 1843 in multiple volumes, the translation made this Persian text accessible to European scholars during the Victorian period's fascination with comparative religion and oriental studies. The translation includes:
- Complete English rendering
- Extensive scholarly notes
- Transliteration of Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit terms
- Introduction contextualizing the work

The translation influenced Victorian orientalism, providing source material for Max Müller and other scholars constructing comparative religious studies as an academic discipline.

## Colonial and Postcolonial Reception

European scholars valued the Dabistān for different reasons than Mughal readers would have:

**Orientalist Interest**: The text fed European fascination with "Eastern religions" and provided ethnographic data about exotic traditions.

**Comparative Religion**: Scholars building taxonomies of world religions used the Dabistān as a source for non-Western religious systems.

**Historical Source**: Historians of Mughal India and religious traditions relied on its documentation of practices and movements.

Postcolonial scholarship recognizes the text's value while noting that Western reception often exoticized its content or used it to construct essentialist categories of "Indian religion" divorced from historical contexts.

## Contemporary Relevance

In the 21st century, the Dabistān speaks to ongoing conversations:

**Religious Pluralism**: The text's tolerant comparative approach offers historical precedent for interfaith dialogue.

**Islamic Intellectual History**: Demonstrates that Islamic civilization produced sophisticated comparative religious scholarship.

**South Asian Religious Studies**: Essential source for understanding premodern religious diversity and interaction.

**Historiography**: Exemplifies indigenous non-European scholarly traditions of comparative analysis.
