# Political History of Ancient India

## Overview
Originally published by the University of Calcutta, Raychaudhuri’s study systematises fragmentary evidence from epics, puranas, Buddhist chronicles, and copper-plate grants to chart the emergence of early Indian states. The book remains a touchstone for modern scholarship on imperial lineages and inter-regional relations up to the fifth century CE.

## Highlights
Raychaudhuri evaluates divergent source traditions, correlating literary accounts with archaeological discoveries and coin legends to clarify succession debates and territorial boundaries. The concluding chapters reassess the political fallout after the Kushana and Gupta periods, offering hypotheses that continue to inform academic discussions.

## Access Notes
The University of Toronto digitisation supplies searchable text, clean images of genealogical tables, and multiple download formats, enabling students and researchers to navigate cross-references with ease.
