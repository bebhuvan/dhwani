# The East India Gazetteer

## Overview
First issued in London in 1815, *The East India Gazetteer* consolidates Walter Hamilton’s efforts to catalogue the political geography of British interests across the Indian subcontinent and its maritime neighbourhood. The volume summarizes provinces, cities, river systems, revenue centres, and cultural markers drawn from official surveys and mercantile reports, supplying a ready reference for administrators and scholars tracking the East India Company’s expanding footprint.

## Highlights
Hamilton arranges entries alphabetically, providing distances, navigational notes, and demographic observations alongside brief sketches of local customs. The work preserves period terminology for South Asian polities and port settlements at the dawn of the nineteenth century, charting the links between inland districts and global trading networks that converged on the Indian Ocean.

## Access Notes
The University of California Libraries scan on the Internet Archive includes searchable text, page thumbnails, and high-resolution downloads (PDF, EPUB, and DjVu). Researchers can inspect the original pagination, index of authorities, and fold-out maps that informed early colonial-era gazetteer writing.
