description: |
  During the early 19th century, Walter Hamilton's "The East India Gazetteer" emerged as a seminal cartographic and administrative compendium that encapsulated the British colonial understanding of the Indian subcontinent during a transformative period of imperial expansion. Published in 1815, the work represents a critical scholarly intervention that systematically documented the complex territorial, administrative, and cultural landscape of British India through meticulous alphabetical entries on provinces, towns, trade routes, and regional characteristics. Hamilton's gazetteer was more than a mere administrative tool; it served as an epistemological framework through which colonial administrators conceptualized and mapped the diverse geographies, economic systems, and sociopolitical structures of the Indian territories under East India Company control. Drawing from extensive Company surveys, revenue records, and local governmental reports, the work provides granular insights into regional demographics, economic configurations, geographical distances, and administrative boundaries during a pivotal transitional moment in Indian history. The gazetteer's comprehensive approach reflected the emerging colonial methodology of knowledge production, where detailed geographical and administrative documentation became instrumental in facilitating imperial governance and economic extraction. For contemporary scholars of colonial studies, Indian history, and historical geography, Hamilton's work represents an invaluable primary source that illuminates the complex interactions between indigenous spatial configurations and colonial cartographic imagination. By meticulously cataloguing local information within an administrative framework, the gazetteer captured a nuanced snapshot of the Indian subcontinent at a critical juncture of cultural, political, and economic transformation, offering modern researchers a sophisticated lens into early 19th-century colonial knowledge systems and territorial representations.

# The East India Gazetteer

## Overview
First issued in London in 1815, *The East India Gazetteer* consolidates Walter Hamilton’s efforts to catalogue the political geography of British interests across the Indian subcontinent and its maritime neighbourhood. The volume summarizes provinces, cities, river systems, revenue centres, and cultural markers drawn from official surveys and mercantile reports, supplying a ready reference for administrators and scholars tracking the East India Company’s expanding footprint.

## Highlights
Hamilton arranges entries alphabetically, providing distances, navigational notes, and demographic observations alongside brief sketches of local customs. The work preserves period terminology for South Asian polities and port settlements at the dawn of the nineteenth century, charting the links between inland districts and global trading networks that converged on the Indian Ocean.
