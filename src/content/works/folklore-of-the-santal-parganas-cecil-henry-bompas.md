  "Folklore of the Santal Parganas" (1909) represents a foundational ethnographic work documenting the oral traditions, mythology, and cultural narratives of the Santal people, one of India's largest Adivasi (indigenous) communities inhabiting the regions of present-day Jharkhand, West Bengal, Bihar, and Odisha. Compiled and translated by Cecil Henry Bompas, a British colonial administrator and amateur ethnographer serving in the Bengal Civil Service, this collection preserves creation myths, origin stories, folk tales, and oral traditions that had been transmitted through generations of Santal communities. The work emerged during the height of British colonial ethnographic practices, when administrators and missionaries systematically documented indigenous cultures, sometimes driven by genuine scholarly interest but always operating within colonial power structures. The Santal people, whose population today exceeds six million, maintain a distinct cultural identity with their own language (Santali, belonging to the Austroasiatic language family), religious practices rooted in animism and nature worship, and social structures that predate Hindu caste hierarchies. Bompas's collection includes cosmogonic narratives explaining the creation of the world and humanity, tales of the supreme deity Thakur Jiu and other spirits inhabiting the natural world, stories explaining the origins of Santal customs and social practices, and moral tales conveying traditional values and wisdom. The folklore reveals sophisticated philosophical concepts regarding humanity's relationship with nature, the spirit world, and cosmic order, demonstrating the intellectual depth of oral traditions that colonial ideologies often dismissed as primitive. The work provides invaluable documentation of Santal worldviews, cosmology, and traditional knowledge systems at a critical historical moment when indigenous cultures faced intense pressure from colonial administration, missionary activity, and economic exploitation. While Bompas's translations inevitably reflect colonial-era perspectives and linguistic limitations, the collection preserves narratives that might otherwise have been lost during rapid social transformations of the twentieth century. For contemporary scholars of Adivasi cultures, anthropology, and South Asian indigenous traditions, this work serves as essential primary source material, offering insights into pre-colonial Santal society and belief systems. The folklore collection contributes to understanding the remarkable cultural diversity of India beyond dominant Hindu and Muslim traditions, documenting the distinct cosmologies and narrative traditions of tribal communities whose histories have been systematically marginalized in mainstream historical narratives. The work remains significant for Santal communities themselves, providing documented versions of traditional stories that contribute to cultural preservation and identity affirmation in contemporary contexts where indigenous knowledge systems continue to face erasure and appropriation.

# Folklore of the Santal Parganas

## Overview

"Folklore of the Santal Parganas," published in 1909 by David Nutt in London, presents a comprehensive collection of oral traditions from the Santal people, one of India's most populous indigenous communities. The Santal Parganas region, located in what is now primarily Jharkhand state (carved from southern Bihar in 2000), with portions extending into West Bengal, Bihar, and Odisha, served as a designated administrative district where Santal communities maintained relative autonomy under special regulations during British colonial rule.

The collection was compiled and translated by Cecil Henry Bompas, a British civil servant in the Bengal administration whose official duties brought him into contact with Santal communities. The actual collection of tales was undertaken by Reverend Paul Olaf Bodding, a Norwegian missionary of the Santal Mission of the Northern Churches (Scandinavian), who spent decades living among Santal communities, learned Santali fluently, and devoted his career to linguistic and ethnographic documentation. Bodding's missionary work, while aimed at conversion, also produced invaluable scholarly contributions including Santali dictionaries, grammars, and folklore collections.

Bompas translated Bodding's materials from Santali into English, adding contextual notes and organizing the narratives thematically. The collection includes creation myths, etiological tales explaining natural phenomena and cultural practices, moral fables, adventure stories, and accounts of interactions between humans and the spirit world that animates Santal cosmology.

## The Santal People: History and Culture

The Santal people (also spelled Santhal) constitute one of India's largest Scheduled Tribes, with populations concentrated in Jharkhand, West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha, and Assam. Their language, Santali, belongs to the Munda branch of the Austroasiatic family, linguistically distinct from the Indo-Aryan languages dominant in northern India and the Dravidian languages of southern India. This linguistic distinctiveness reflects the Santals' status as descendants of some of India's earliest inhabitants, predating Aryan migrations.

Traditional Santal society organized around village communities with distinctive social structures including age-grade associations, communal decision-making councils, and egalitarian gender relations that contrasted sharply with caste-based Hindu society. Santal religion centers on worship of Thakur Jiu (the supreme creator) and numerous spirits (bonga) inhabiting natural features, ancestors, and various domains of life. Religious specialists including the village priest (naeke) and diviner (ojha) maintained ritual knowledge and mediated between human and spirit worlds.

Historically, Santals practiced shifting cultivation and forest gathering before colonial land policies and economic pressures forced transitions to settled agriculture. The nineteenth century witnessed increasing Santal displacement as moneylenders, landlords, and British administrators appropriated traditional lands. These pressures culminated in the Santal Hul (rebellion) of 1855-56, a major uprising against British rule, exploitative landlords, and moneylenders that was violently suppressed but demonstrated organized Santal resistance to colonial exploitation.

## Cecil Henry Bompas and Colonial Ethnography

Cecil Henry Bompas served as a British colonial administrator in Bengal during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Like many colonial civil servants, Bompas combined administrative duties with amateur scholarly interests in the cultures he governed. His role as translator and compiler of Santal folklore exemplifies a common pattern where colonial officials produced ethnographic documentation that served multiple purposes: intellectual curiosity, administrative knowledge facilitating governance, and contributions to metropolitan scholarly discourse.

Colonial ethnography operated within power structures that positioned indigenous cultures as objects of study rather than as intellectual equals. Ethnographers often approached indigenous traditions through evolutionary frameworks assuming European cultural superiority and viewing non-European societies as representing earlier stages of human development. Nevertheless, works like Bompas's collection preserved cultural materials that might otherwise have been lost, providing contemporary descendants and scholars valuable documentation despite methodological limitations.

Bompas relied heavily on the Rev. P.O. Bodding's work. Bodding (1865-1938) devoted his life to Santal language and culture, producing a massive Santali-English dictionary, grammatical studies, and extensive folklore collections. His missionary motivations coexisted with genuine linguistic and anthropological scholarship, creating a complex legacy typical of missionary ethnography.

## Themes in Santal Folklore

### Creation Narratives

The collection includes Santal cosmogonic myths explaining the world's origins, humanity's creation, and the establishment of social order. These narratives feature Thakur Jiu creating the world and the first human couple, often with assistance or interference from other spirits. Creation stories establish foundational principles of Santal cosmology including the sacred relationship between humans and nature, the role of spirits in daily life, and the origins of death, suffering, and social differentiation.

### Etiological Tales

Many stories explain the origins of natural features, animal characteristics, cultural practices, and social customs. These pourquoi narratives answer questions like why certain animals have particular features, how specific festivals originated, why marriage customs take certain forms, or how particular geographical features came to be. Such tales encode traditional ecological knowledge, social norms, and cultural memory in narrative form.

### Spirit World and Human Interaction

A central theme throughout Santal folklore involves interactions between humans and the spirit world. Spirits (bongas) inhabit mountains, forests, water bodies, and other natural features, possessing agency and moral character. Tales recount encounters between humans and spirits, sometimes benevolent and sometimes threatening, teaching proper ritual behavior, respect for nature, and consequences of violating sacred boundaries. These narratives reflect animistic worldviews where spiritual forces permeate the material world, requiring continuous negotiation and propitiation.

### Moral and Didactic Tales

The collection includes numerous stories conveying moral lessons, proper social behavior, and traditional values. Themes include the rewards of honesty, hospitality, and courage; the consequences of greed, deception, and cruelty; and the importance of maintaining social solidarity and respecting elders. These tales served pedagogical functions, transmitting cultural values across generations through entertaining narratives.

## Significance for Adivasi Studies

"Folklore of the Santal Parganas" represents crucial documentation of indigenous Indian traditions distinct from dominant Hindu and Muslim cultures. Adivasi communities, comprising roughly 8-9% of India's population, maintain cultural identities, languages, and traditions that predate later migrations and cultural formations. However, mainstream Indian historiography and cultural narratives have systematically marginalized Adivasi contributions, treating indigenous peoples as peripheral to national narratives.

The folklore collection contributes to recognizing cultural diversity within India and challenging homogenizing narratives that erase indigenous distinctiveness. For Santal communities and other Adivasi groups, documented folklore supports cultural preservation efforts, language revitalization programs, and contemporary identity politics asserting indigenous rights and cultural autonomy against pressures toward assimilation.

Contemporary Adivasi movements draw on documented traditional knowledge to support claims for forest rights, cultural autonomy, and recognition of indigenous intellectual property. Folklore collections like Bompas's work, despite colonial origins, provide evidence of distinct cultural traditions, cosmologies, and knowledge systems that inform contemporary indigenous activism and scholarship.

## Methodological Considerations and Limitations

The collection reflects inevitable limitations of colonial-era ethnography. Translation from Santali to English involved linguistic challenges, as Santali concepts, cosmological categories, and narrative conventions don't always map neatly onto English equivalents. Bompas's translations prioritized accessibility for English readers over linguistic precision, potentially flattening cultural specificity.

Additionally, the process of collection and documentation occurred within power imbalances characteristic of colonialism. Informants' motivations for sharing sacred knowledge with missionaries and administrators remain unclearcooperation might reflect genuine educational intent, economic necessity, or pressure from colonial authority. The selection and organization of tales imposed external frameworks potentially at odds with how Santals themselves categorized and transmitted these narratives.

Despite these limitations, the work preserves narratives that might otherwise have been lost during twentieth-century social transformations. Rapid modernization, linguistic shift toward dominant regional languages, religious conversion, and social disruption have threatened oral traditions across indigenous communities. Documentary collections, however imperfect, serve as valuable archives for cultural preservation and scholarly research.

## Contemporary Relevance

"Folklore of the Santal Parganas" remains relevant for multiple contemporary constituencies. Scholars of South Asian anthropology, folklore studies, and indigenous traditions utilize the collection as primary source material for understanding pre-colonial Santal society and belief systems. Comparative folklorists examine narrative patterns, motifs, and themes connecting Santal traditions to broader Austroasiatic and South Asian folklore.

For Santal communities, the collection provides documented versions of traditional stories supporting cultural preservation initiatives, educational programs teaching Santali language and culture, and identity affirmation in contexts where indigenous cultures face continuing marginalization. Contemporary Santal writers and artists draw on traditional narratives documented in collections like this one as sources for creative work engaging with cultural heritage.

The work also contributes to decolonial scholarship examining how colonial knowledge production documented indigenous cultures while simultaneously facilitating their subordination. Critical analysis of colonial ethnography illuminates the complex legacies of works that both preserved and exoticized indigenous traditions, informing contemporary approaches to ethical cross-cultural research and representation.

## Digital Access

"Folklore of the Santal Parganas" remains widely accessible through digital repositories. Project Gutenberg provides complete electronic texts in multiple formats, while the Internet Archive maintains scanned editions preserving original typography and layout. These digital resources ensure continued availability for researchers, Santal community members, and general readers interested in indigenous Indian traditions and comparative folklore studies.
