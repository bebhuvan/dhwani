# Personal and Geographical Names in the Gupta Inscriptions

## Overview

Tej Ram Sharma's *Personal and Geographical Names in the Gupta Inscriptions* (1978) represents pioneering onomastic research systematically analyzing naming patterns in inscriptions from the Gupta period (c. 320-550 CE)—India's classical age of Sanskrit literature, artistic achievement, and imperial consolidation. This specialized scholarly monograph catalogs and analyzes thousands of personal names and place names from Gupta-era stone and copper-plate inscriptions, revealing linguistic evolution, social structures, religious affiliations, administrative organization, and historical geography through systematic study of how people and places were named.

Onomastics—the study of names—provides unique historical evidence. Personal names reveal religious devotion (theophoric elements like Vishnu-gupta, Shiva-datta), social status (titles, honorifics), linguistic changes (Sanskrit-Prakrit interactions), and cultural values. Geographical names map political geography, urban centers, administrative divisions, and territorial extent. Sharma's systematic compilation makes this scattered data—buried across hundreds of inscriptions published in various epigraphic collections—accessible in organized form with linguistic analysis and historical context.

The work serves multiple scholarly purposes: epigraphers gain systematic name indices for dating and authenticating inscriptions; linguists study Indo-Aryan morphology and phonological changes; historians reconstruct administrative geography and social hierarchies; genealogists trace elite family networks—demonstrating how specialized onomastic study illuminates broader historical processes.

## About Tej Ram Sharma

Tej Ram Sharma specialized in Indian epigraphy and historical linguistics, producing detailed studies on Gupta-period inscriptions. His scholarly approach combined rigorous philological analysis with historical interpretation, treating names not merely as labels but as cultural artifacts revealing social, religious, and linguistic dimensions of Gupta civilization.

This monograph emerged from systematic study of published Gupta inscriptions, compiling comprehensive name lists with grammatical analysis, meaning explanations, and historical contextualization—patient, meticulous scholarship making scattered data systematically useful.

## The Gupta Period Context

The Gupta Empire (c. 320-550 CE) represents classical Indian civilization's zenith:

**Political Unity**: Imperial consolidation across northern India creating stable administrative framework.

**Cultural Flourishing**: Sanskrit literature (Kalidasa's poetry and drama), mathematical advances (decimal system, zero), astronomical treatises, temple architecture, sculpture.

**Religious Patronage**: Hindu revival with elaborate temple construction and Brahmanical patronage, alongside continuing Buddhist and Jain communities.

**Administrative Development**: Sophisticated bureaucracy, territorial organization, revenue systems.

**Epigraphic Wealth**: Hundreds of inscriptions documenting land grants, temple endowments, genealogies, administrative appointments—source material for Sharma's study.

## Methodological Approach

### Source Base

Sharma systematically examined all published Gupta inscriptions available in epigraphic collections:
- *Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum*
- *Epigraphia Indica*
- Archaeological Survey reports
- Regional epigraphic compilations

This comprehensive source coverage ensures representative sampling across geographical regions and inscription types.

### Analytical Framework

**Collection**: Extracting all personal and geographical names from inscriptions.

**Classification**: Organizing names by linguistic structure, religious affiliation, social function.

**Morphological Analysis**: Examining name formation patterns—compound structures, suffixes, prefixes, grammatical genders.

**Semantic Analysis**: Determining meanings, religious significance, social implications.

**Historical Contextualization**: Relating names to broader Gupta social, religious, political patterns.

**Comparative Study**: Examining name changes across regions and time periods.

## Personal Names Analysis

### Theophoric Names

Names incorporating deity names reveal religious devotion patterns:

**Vishnu-Compounds**: Vishnugupta, Vishnu-datta, Vishnu-vardhana indicating Vaishnavite affiliation.

**Shiva-Compounds**: Shiva-gupta, Shiva-datta, Shiva-vardhana showing Shaivite devotion.

**Devi-Names**: Goddess-related names indicating Shakta traditions.

**Buddhist Names**: Buddha-gupta, Dharma-deva among Buddhist communities.

Statistical analysis reveals Vaishnavism's dominance in Gupta elite patronage.

### Name Structure

**Two-Element Compounds**: Most common pattern combining divine/auspicious term with qualifier (e.g., Chandra-gupta "moon-protected").

**Suffixes**: -gupta (protected), -datta (given), -vardhana (increasing), -deva (god), -simha (lion) indicating meanings and social aspirations.

**Gender Marking**: Distinct male/female name patterns revealing gender in fragmentary inscriptions.

### Titles and Epithets

Sharma catalogs title systems revealing administrative hierarchies:

**Imperial Titles**: Maharajadhiraja (emperor), Paramabhattaraka (supreme lord), Parama-daivata (supremely divine).

**Administrative Titles**: Mahadandanayaka (chief justice), Kumaramatya (minister), Rajasthaniya (provincial governor).

**Military Titles**: Mahabaladhikrita (commander of forces), Senapati (general).

**Religious Titles**: Mahasandhivigrahika (chief minister of peace and war), Dharma-mahadhikarana (chief judicial officer).

Title evolution tracks administrative development and social stratification.

### Social Stratification

Name patterns reveal social hierarchies:

**Elite Sanskrit Names**: Brahmins and Kshatriyas favoring elaborate Sanskrit compounds.

**Prakrit Influences**: Lower social strata showing Prakrit phonological features.

**Professional Names**: Occupational surnames indicating hereditary specializations.

**Regional Variations**: Geographical differences in naming conventions.

## Geographical Names

### Urban Centers

Sharma catalogs major cities mentioned in Gupta inscriptions:

**Imperial Capitals**: Pataliputra (Patna), Ayodhya, Ujjain.

**Provincial Centers**: Regional administrative headquarters.

**Port Cities**: Coastal trade centers.

**Sacred Sites**: Pilgrimage destinations receiving royal patronage.

### Administrative Divisions

**Bhuktis**: Provincial divisions (e.g., Tirabhukti, Puṇḍravardhana-bhukti).

**Vishyas**: District-level administrative units.

**Villages**: Local settlements with detailed agrarian geography.

### Territorial Extent

Geographical names map Gupta imperial reach:

**Core Territory**: Gangetic plain heartland.

**Tributary Regions**: Areas under indirect control.

**Southern Extent**: Deccan penetration limits.

**Western Frontiers**: Interaction zones with Western Kshatrapas, later Huns.

### Sacred Geography

**Tirthas**: Pilgrimage sites receiving endowments.

**Temple Towns**: Emerging sacred centers.

**Ashrams**: Brahmanical hermitages.

### Economic Geography

**Trade Routes**: Towns along commercial networks.

**Agricultural Regions**: Productive zones supporting revenue.

**Mines and Resources**: Areas yielding precious materials.

## Linguistic Insights

### Sanskrit-Prakrit Interaction

Name forms reveal linguistic contact:

**Phonological Changes**: Prakrit influence on Sanskrit pronunciation (aspiration loss, simplification).

**Code-Switching**: Mixed Sanskrit-Prakrit name elements.

**Hypercorrection**: Attempts at Sanskritization revealing spoken language substrates.

**Regional Variants**: Geographical distribution of phonological features.

### Name Formation Patterns

**Compound Types**: Tatpurusha, Bahuvrihi, Dvandva compounds in personal names.

**Derivational Morphology**: Suffix patterns creating names from roots.

**Gender Marking**: Masculine/feminine ending patterns (-a/-ā, -deva/-devī).

### Semantic Fields

**Auspicious Meanings**: Names expressing hopes for protection, prosperity, virtue.

**Martial Values**: Lion, tiger, warrior imagery in elite names.

**Religious Devotion**: Deity dedication, virtuous qualities.

**Natural Elements**: Sun, moon, earth, lotus in compounds.

### Dating Inscriptions

Onomastic evidence helps date undated inscriptions through:

**Name Fashions**: Popularity of certain name types in specific periods.

### Social History

Name analysis reveals:

**Sanskritization**: Lower castes adopting Sanskrit names for social mobility.

**Religious Patronage**: Elite religious preferences through theophoric names.
