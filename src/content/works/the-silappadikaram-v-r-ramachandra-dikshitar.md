# The Silappadikaram

## Overview

V.R. Ramachandra Dikshitar's 1939 translation was an early English rendering of the Tamil epic Cilappatikaram, attributed to Jain monk Ilango Adigal. The epic's 5,730 lines in akaval meter tell the tragic story of Kannaki and Kovalan, an ordinary couple whose lives unfold across three Tamil kingdoms, exploring themes of marital fidelity, justice, and divine retribution. Dikshitar's translation includes scholarly introduction and notes. While Dikshitar dated the text to approximately 171 CE based on internal historical references, the composition is now generally placed in the 5th-6th century CE.

## About Ilango Adigal

Ilango Adigal (also Iḷaṅkō Aṭikaḷ) is traditionally credited as the author of Cilappatikaram. According to literary tradition, he was a Jain monk and possibly a Chera prince who renounced his claim to the throne. While the historical existence of Ilango Adigal remains debated among scholars, the text itself provides evidence of deep knowledge of Jain philosophy, Tamil geography, and courtly culture, suggesting an author familiar with both religious and secular traditions.

## About the Translator

V.R. Ramachandra Dikshitar (1896-1953) was a distinguished historian, Indologist, and Dravidologist who served as Professor of Indian History and Archaeology at the University of Madras. His translation of the Silappadikaram in 1939, published by Oxford University Press, represented pioneering work in making classical Tamil literature accessible to English-reading audiences. Dikshitar's scholarly apparatus provided historical context and interpretive frameworks that shaped subsequent Tamil literary studies.

## The Epic Narrative

The Cilappatikaram unfolds across three cantos corresponding to three major Tamil cities:
- **Pukar Kandam**: The merchant Kovalan's marriage to the virtuous Kannaki, his infatuation with courtesan Madhavi, and the couple's impoverishment
- **Madurai Kandam**: The couple's journey to Madurai, Kovalan's false accusation of theft and execution, and Kannaki's rage leading to the city's destruction
- **Vanji Kandam**: Kannaki's deification and the Chera king's tribute to her as goddess of chastity

The narrative weaves together elements of romance, tragedy, and divine intervention while documenting contemporary Tamil culture, trade, music, and religious practices.

## Literary and Cultural Significance

The Silappadikaram holds a position in Tamil literature analogous to the Iliad in Greek culture—a foundational epic defining cultural values and literary standards. The work demonstrates sophisticated knowledge of Tamil prosody, music theory (with detailed descriptions of various ragas and instruments), dance forms, and religious traditions including Buddhism, Jainism, and Hinduism. The portrayal of Kannaki as an exemplar of wifely devotion who nevertheless demands justice has made her a complex and enduring figure in Tamil cultural consciousness.

## This Translation

Dikshitar's 1939 Oxford University Press edition provides:
- Complete English translation of all three cantos
- Scholarly introduction examining historical context and dating
- Annotations explaining cultural references, musical terminology, and religious concepts
- Analysis of the epic's literary structure and significance

Dikshitar's dating of the epic to approximately 171 CE based on internal references to historical figures, while influential, has been revised by subsequent scholarship which generally places composition in the 5th-6th century CE.

## Digital Preservation

This 409-page translation has been digitized from BT College, Madanapale through the S.V. Digital Library, Tirupati, and is freely accessible through the Digital Library of India. The work remains essential for understanding classical Tamil literature and continues to inform scholarly and artistic engagements with Tamil cultural heritage.
