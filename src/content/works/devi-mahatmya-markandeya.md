description: "The Devi Mahatmya (Durga Saptashati) represents Hindu goddess worship's foundational text, presenting Devi's supreme power through three mythological narratives comprising 700 verses celebrating her victories over cosmic demons. Composed around 5th-6th century CE as part of Markandeya Purana, this influential work established Shakta theology: Devi as ultimate reality transcending male deities, feminine divine power (shakti) as creation-sustenance-destruction source, and goddess devotion as legitimate liberation path. The three episodes narrate: Devi as Mahakali destroying Madhu-Kaitabha demons threatening creation, as Mahalakshmi defeating buffalo-demon Mahishasura representing ego's tyranny, and as Mahasaraswati vanquishing Shumbha-Nishumbha symbolizing duality. Beyond mythological narrative, the text presents sophisticated theology: goddess as both transcendent (nirguna brahman) and immanent (manifesting as Durga-Lakshmi-Saraswati), power (shakti) as divine feminine principle, and devotional worship (bhakti) enabling divine grace. The work profoundly influenced Hindu practice through Navaratri festival celebrating Devi's victory, established goddess theology rivaling Vaishnava-Shaiva traditions, and demonstrated feminine divinity's philosophical legitimacy."
