# État civil, politique et commerçant du Bengale (Volume 2)

## Overview
Volume 2 of Bolts’s French translation extends his critique of Company rule beyond Plassey, dissecting the reorganisation of Bengal’s revenue administration under Henry Vansittart and the rise of private mercantile syndicates. Bolts presents detailed tables of land assignments, salt and opium monopolies, and the corruption trials that followed Robert Clive’s return to Britain.

## Highlights
Bolts surveys the Company’s alliances with Shuja-ud-Daula and Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II, exposes insider contracts awarded to Company servants, and analyses how remittances, bills of exchange, and speculative lending drained Bengal’s treasury. His appendices reproduce correspondence seized during parliamentary inquiries, offering contemporary primary sources.

## Access Notes
The Internet Archive scan preserves the engraved maps and statistical annexes included in the Maastricht edition, with OCR that assists researchers comparing the French translation to Bolts’s English original.
