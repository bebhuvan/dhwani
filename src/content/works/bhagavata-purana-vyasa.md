description: "The Bhagavata Purana, also known as Srimad Bhagavatam, stands as the most revered text in Vaishnava devotional traditions, presenting Krishna as supreme deity through sophisticated theology, mythology, and devotional poetry. Composed between 8th-10th centuries CE, this work of 18,000 verses across twelve skandhas (books) narrates cosmic creation, avatar histories, and especially Krishna's complete life storyâ€”from miraculous birth in Mathura through childhood exploits in Vrindavan to final departure from earthly realm. The tenth book, comprising one-fourth of the entire Purana, details Krishna's divine play (lila) with gopis, philosophical dialogues, and heroic deeds, establishing bhakti (devotion) as supreme path to liberation. Beyond narrative, the text presents sophisticated Vedantic philosophy synthesizing non-dualism with theistic devotion, establishing that love for Krishna constitutes both means and goal of spiritual life. The Bhagavata's literary excellence in Sanskrit, philosophical depth, and devotional intensity made it foundational to Vaishnavism across regional traditions from Chaitanya's Bengali movement to South Indian Alvar poetry."
