"The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians: The Muhammadan Period" represents a foundational yet controversial eight-volume compendium of English translations from medieval Persian and Arabic chronicles, published between 1867 and 1877 by Trubner & Co. in London. The work originated from the efforts of Henry Miers Elliot (1808-1853), a British East India Company administrator who served as foreign secretary under Governor-Generals Henry Hardinge and James Broun-Ramsay. Elliot conceived the project but died in 1853 at Simonstown, South Africa, before completing it. John Dowson (1820-1881), a scholar of oriental languages including Arabic, Persian, Sanskrit, Telugu, and Hindustani, who held professorships at University College London and the Staff College Camberley, undertook the extensive task of extending and editing Elliot's manuscripts posthumously.

The eight volumes contain partial translations and extracts from tarikhs and tawarikhs spanning from the eighth to the nineteenth centuries, covering the period from the early Islamic conquests through the decline of the Mughal Empire. Volume 3 addresses the period from Nasir-ud-din Mahmud's death (1246-66) to Timur's rise in the late fourteenth century, including Timur's purported autobiography and the Zafarnama. Volume 6 presents extracts from Abu-l Fazl's Akbar-nama. Volume 7 covers Shah Jahan (1592-1666) to Muhammad Shah's early reign (1702-48), featuring various Padshahnama and substantial portions of Khafi Khan's Muntakhab-ul-Lubab. Volume 8 addresses criticisms of previous volumes, provides corrections, and includes additional histories documenting the Mughal Empire's terminal phase through British ascendancy.

The compilation drew upon major Persian chronicles including Minhaj-i-Siraj's Tabaqat-i-Nasiri, completed in 1260 CE, which recounts Islamic history from Adam through the Delhi Sultanate period and constitutes a crucial source for understanding Muslim rule in Bengal. Another central text was Ziauddin Barani's Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi, completed in 1357 CE, which continues where the Tabaqat-i-Nasiri concludes, covering ninety-five years from Balban's accession (1266 CE) to the sixth year of Firoz Shah Tughlaq's reign (1357 CE). These chronicles reflected the political concerns of the Delhi Sultans, emphasizing legitimacy, Islamic governance, and the sultan's dual temporal and spiritual authority.

Elliot's explicit colonial agenda fundamentally shaped the work's interpretative framework. In his preface, Elliot stated his hope that the translations would "make our native subjects more sensible of the immense advantages accruing to them under the mildness and equity of our rule" by demonstrating what he characterized as the violence and despotism of Muslim rulers. This ideological positioning presented pre-British rule as chaotic, oppressive, and backward, constructing a stark contrast with British colonial administration, which could then be framed as orderly, just, and progressive. The narrative positioned colonialism not as conquest but as liberation, supporting the broader colonial project of justifying British imperial presence.

The work's selective methodology presents significant scholarly problems. The volumes contain incomplete translations, with only portions of texts published, and translation quality varies considerably. Documents were sometimes drawn from single manuscript versions when multiple variants existed. The selection bias favored passages emphasizing religious conflict, temple desecration, and conquest while minimizing or excluding materials on administrative achievements, cultural patronage, syncretism, or peaceful coexistence. This systematic distortion created an overwhelmingly negative portrayal of Muslim rule that served colonial divide-and-rule policies by emphasizing Hindu-Muslim antagonism as historically inevitable.

The paradox of the work's title deserves scrutiny. The phrase "as told by its own historians" falsely suggests indigenous Indian authorship, yet the actual authors were medieval Persian and Arabic chroniclers, often court historians writing within specific political contexts. The colonial editors then subjected these sources to selective translation and interpretative framing that served British imperial interests. The underlying assumption, as scholars have noted, was that true historical consciousness arrived only with British conquest, positioning Indian history as fundamentally alien to Indians themselves until colonizers provided the framework for understanding it.

S.H. Hodivala (1867-1944), an iconic figure in medieval Indian numismatics and historical studies, undertook the formidable task of critically annotating all eight volumes in his "Studies in Indo-Muslim History." The first volume appeared in 1939, with the second published posthumously in 1957. Hodivala worked through new material, selecting and criticizing Elliot and Dowson's choices while adding his own scholarly corrections. Despite the significance of this critique, Hodivala's volumes fell into obscurity while Elliot and Dowson's work continued through multiple reprints, demonstrating the persistence of colonial frameworks in historiographical circulation.

Peter Hardy's "Historians of Medieval India" (1997) provides essential critical contextualization. Francis Robinson noted in 2010 that Elliot and Dowson's work "should always be read with Peter Hardy's Historians of Medieval India to hand." Hardy, who served at the School of Oriental and African Studies from 1947 to 1983, argued that Elliot "initiated the second phase" of British historical writing on medieval India, characterized by "a very poor opinion of medieval historians" and "a prejudiced and even a contemptuous attitude" toward India's medieval past, contrasting sharply with the liberal phase represented by Mountstuart Elphinstone.

Richard Eaton, a prominent historian of medieval India, argues that present-day Hindu nationalists have "selectively used" Elliot and Dowson's already "selective translations" to denigrate pre-modern Muslim rulers. This double selectivity amplifies the original colonial distortions, creating historiographical foundations for communal politics. Scholars have observed that Hindutva historiography's premises derive directly from colonial Indology, perpetuating rather than challenging colonial frameworks. The work's emphasis on religious conflict and Muslim-Hindu antagonism provided ideological ammunition for communal narratives that continue to shape contemporary Indian politics.

The long-term scholarly impact proved deeply problematic. For decades, the compilation functioned as the definitive English-language source on medieval Indian history. Scholars relied heavily on these translations and interpretations without critically examining the selection bias or colonial framework, creating a self-reinforcing cycle wherein colonial interpretations achieved academic orthodoxy. This dominance hindered alternative perspectives from gaining recognition and established problematic patterns in the historiography of medieval India that subsequent generations of scholars have worked to deconstruct.

Contemporary scholarship recognizes the work's dual significance: the volumes remain valuable for making portions of important Persian and Arabic sources accessible in English translation, yet they simultaneously exemplify historiography as a colonial instrument. Modern historians approach Elliot and Dowson's translations with critical awareness of their ideological framing, selective methodology, and political agenda. The work stands as a crucial case study in how colonial powers deployed historical scholarship to legitimize imperial domination, construct communal divisions, and shape narratives of the colonized past to serve metropolitan interests.

The reception history reveals how colonial historiographical frameworks persist beyond formal decolonization. While mainstream historians have challenged the stereotypes promoted by imperialist historians, the continued circulation of Elliot and Dowson's work without adequate critical apparatus enables ongoing misappropriation. The volumes' accessibility and apparent comprehensiveness make them attractive to readers unaware of their methodological problems and ideological baggage. This accessibility, combined with the relative obscurity of critical works like Hodivala's annotations, perpetuates colonial distortions in popular understanding of medieval Indian history.

The work's framing of the "Muhammadan Period" as a discrete historical category imposes religious communalism onto complex historical processes where religious identity intersected with linguistic, regional, political, and cultural affiliations in multiple configurations. Medieval Indian rulers, whether Muslim or Hindu, operated within shared political cultures and governance systems. Reducing this complexity to religious conflict serves colonial divide-and-rule strategies rather than historical accuracy. The Persianate cultural world that shaped medieval Indian courts was cosmopolitan and syncretic, characteristics systematically downplayed in Elliot and Dowson's selective translations.

Recent scholarly work emphasizes that culture rather than religion constituted the core of the Persianate Age in South Asia, directly challenging the Hindu nationalist ideology that relies on Elliot and Dowson's framework to construct rigid religious divisions. Decolonizing the historiography of medieval India requires moving beyond the colonial categories and assumptions embedded in works like "The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians" toward approaches that recognize the period's cultural complexity, political sophistication, and religious pluralism without minimizing genuine conflicts or idealizing the past.

The title's irony extends further when considering that the "historians" in question wrote for specific audiences within medieval courts, employing rhetorical conventions and pursuing patronage objectives that shaped their narratives in ways Elliot and Dowson neither acknowledged nor accounted for. Reading these chronicles as transparent windows into historical reality, rather than as crafted texts requiring critical analysis of authorial position, audience, and purpose, constitutes a fundamental methodological failure that colonial ideology encouraged. Modern historiography applies source criticism to these chronicles, examining their production contexts, comparing multiple accounts, and distinguishing between rhetorical topoi and documentable events.

Despite extensive scholarly critique, Elliot and Dowson's volumes continue to circulate and influence popular understanding of medieval Indian history. Their availability in reprints and digital formats, combined with the perception of comprehensiveness, ensures ongoing impact. Educational efforts to contextualize these translations, provide critical apparatus, and make alternative sources accessible remain essential to counteracting the colonial frameworks embedded in this foundational yet fundamentally flawed historiographical project. The work stands as a reminder that historical scholarship never operates independently of power relations, and that decolonizing knowledge production requires sustained critical engagement with inherited colonial categories and assumptions.
