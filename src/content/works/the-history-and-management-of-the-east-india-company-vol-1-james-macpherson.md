# The History and Management of the East-India Company (Vol. 1)

## Overview
Scottish writer and politician James Macpherson prepared this 1782 critique while representing the Nawab of Arcot’s interests in Britain. The volume surveys Company diplomacy in the Carnatic, especially the contested obligations to the Nawab. Drawing on official correspondence and parliamentary papers, Macpherson argues that London directors sanctioned policies that destabilised revenue settlements and provoked warfare across southern India.

## Highlights
Macpherson traces the Company’s rise from chartered firm to territorial power, contrasts treaties concluded with local rulers and the French, and reproduces extracts from dispatches to show how policy diverged between Madras, Calcutta, and London. He defends the Nawab’s hereditary rights, condemns the seizure of districts assigned for debt repayment, and offers proposals for restoring financial discipline within the Company’s military establishment.

## Access Notes
The University of California Libraries scan on the Internet Archive includes searchable text, full PDF downloads, and bibliographical footnotes absent from later abridgements, making it a useful source for studying parliamentary debates on early Company governance.
