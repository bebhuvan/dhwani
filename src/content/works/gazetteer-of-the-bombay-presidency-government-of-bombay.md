## Administrative Structure and Governance

The Bombay Presidency represented one of the most significant territorial possessions of the British East India Company and later the British Crown in India. Organized under a Governor-in-Council system, the presidency comprised five administrative divisions: Sind, Gujarat, Konkan, Deccan, and Carnatic. Each division was further subdivided into districts, taluks, and villages, creating a hierarchical bureaucratic framework. This gazetteer served as the official documentation of this administrative apparatus, recording the governance structures, revenue systems, and institutional mechanisms through which colonial authority was exercised.

## Geographic and Territorial Documentation

The gazetteer provides exhaustive geographic documentation covering the presidency's boundaries, topography, climate zones, river systems, and natural resources. It records the Arabian Sea coast to the west and internal geography of territories encompassing present-day Gujarat, western Maharashtra, Sind, and parts of the Deccan plateau. The work systematized geographical information essential for colonial administration, including information about ports, trade routes, and resource distribution critical to British commercial and strategic interests.

## Colonial Knowledge Production and Census Data

As an instrument of colonial knowledge production, the gazetteer integrated diverse data collection methodologies. It compiled census information, revenue records, agricultural statistics, and commercial data, representing the bureaucratic rationalization and quantification of Indian territories. The work exemplified the systematic cataloguing imperative of 19th-century British imperialism, wherein comprehensive written documentation of territories served both administrative efficiency and ideological legitimation of colonial rule. Statistical tables, measurements, and classifications reflected colonial epistemologies regarding Indian geography and population.

## Primary Source Value

For historians and researchers, the gazetteer functions as an invaluable primary source documenting colonial administrative priorities, territorial organization, and state-making practices in 19th-century India. It records infrastructure development, military installations, commercial enterprises, and resource extraction systems established during the colonial period. Contemporary revenue assessments, demographic data, and economic information preserved in the gazetteer provide empirical documentation of colonial economic impact and administrative transformation of Indian territories, enabling critical analysis of colonial governance mechanisms.
