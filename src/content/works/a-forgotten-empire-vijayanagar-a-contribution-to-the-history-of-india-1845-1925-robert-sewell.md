# A Forgotten Empire (Vijayanagar): A Contribution to the History of India

## Overview

"A Forgotten Empire" by Robert Sewell is a groundbreaking historical work that rescued the Vijayanagara Empire from historical obscurity and established it as one of the most significant medieval Indian kingdoms. First published in 1900, this seminal study reconstructed the history of an empire that ruled much of South India from 1336 to 1646 CE, controlling vast territories from the Krishna River to the tip of the Indian peninsula. Sewell's meticulous research, based on Portuguese chronicles, Persian histories, and archaeological evidence, revealed the remarkable achievements of a Hindu empire that successfully resisted Muslim invasions for over three centuries.

## About Robert Sewell

**Robert Sewell** (1845-1925) was a distinguished British civil servant, historian, and orientalist who spent much of his career in India. As a member of the Indian Civil Service, he had unique access to historical records and archaeological sites, which he used to reconstruct forgotten chapters of Indian history. Sewell's systematic approach to historical research, combining written sources with archaeological evidence, made him a pioneer in the field of South Indian historiography. His other notable works include studies on Indian chronology and contributions to understanding medieval South Indian political systems.

## Historical Significance

### Rediscovering the Vijayanagara Empire
Before Sewell's work, the Vijayanagara Empire was largely unknown to modern historians and the general public. European colonial histories had focused primarily on Mughal and British periods, overlooking this magnificent Hindu kingdom that had flourished in South India. Sewell's research revealed:

- **Political Achievement**: A sophisticated administrative system that governed territories larger than contemporary European kingdoms
- **Military Innovation**: Advanced fortification systems and military tactics that successfully defended against multiple Muslim invasions
- **Economic Prosperity**: A thriving trade network that connected South India with Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Europe
- **Cultural Renaissance**: Patronage of art, architecture, literature, and temple construction that created a distinctive South Indian cultural synthesis

### Archaeological and Historical Methodology
Sewell's approach was revolutionary for its time:
- **Multisource Research**: Combined Portuguese chronicles, Muslim historians' accounts, inscriptions, and archaeological evidence
- **Site Visits**: Extensive fieldwork at Hampi (the empire's capital) and other Vijayanagara sites
- **Chronological Reconstruction**: Careful dating of events using multiple source traditions
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Recognition of Indian historical traditions alongside European sources
