## Compilation History and Structure

"Path to God" (also published as "Pathway to God") represents a systematic compilation of Gandhi's spiritual writings edited by M.S. Deshpande and published by Navajivan Publishing House, Ahmedabad in 1971. The first edition comprised 2,000 copies, issued three years after Gandhi's assassination. Deshpande extracted passages from Gandhi's extensive corpus of writings, speeches, and correspondence spanning five decades, organizing them thematically to present a coherent spiritual philosophy. The compilation draws from "Young India," "Harijan," Gandhi's autobiography "The Story of My Experiments with Truth," letters to disciples, ashram discourses, and prayer meeting addresses. This editorial work belongs to a broader project of preserving and systematizing Gandhi's thought, paralleling other compilations like "Truth is God" (edited by R.K. Prabhu) that similarly organized his scattered writings on spirituality into accessible formats for international audiences seeking practical guidance on religious living.

## Central Spiritual Principles

### Truth as God

Gandhi's mature spiritual philosophy centered on the revolutionary formulation "Truth is God" rather than the conventional "God is Truth." This inversion possessed profound theological and practical implications. By identifying the divine with truth rather than subordinating truth to divine revelation, Gandhi made spirituality accessible to atheists, agnostics, and seekers from all traditions who could pursue truth without requiring belief in anthropomorphic deity. Truth manifested not through scriptural authority or mystical experience but through rigorous moral experimentation in daily life. Gandhi's concept of truth transcended mere factual accuracy, encompassing moral righteousness, cosmic order (rita), and ultimate reality. The pursuit of truth demanded complete transparency, admission of error, and willingness to revise beliefs based on new understanding. This experimental approach to spirituality paralleled scientific method, treating life itself as laboratory for testing moral hypotheses.

### Ahimsa (Nonviolence)

Ahimsa constituted the primary means to truth-realization in Gandhi's system. He considered truth and nonviolence so fundamentally intertwined as to be practically inseparable, stating that ahimsa represented the means while truth remained the end. Gandhi expanded ahimsa beyond mere physical non-harm to encompass thought, speech, and action. Perfect nonviolence required eliminating hatred, anger, and ill-will even toward oppressors, replacing these with active love. This positive conception of ahimsa as love-force or soul-force (satyagraha) distinguished it from passive non-resistance. The Bhagavad Gita lists ahimsa as the first and most essential virtue, a teaching Gandhi emphasized repeatedly. Nonviolence demanded greater courage than violence, requiring willingness to suffer injury without retaliation while maintaining compassion for adversaries. Gandhi's interpretation challenged religious traditions justifying violence for righteous causes, arguing that violent means inevitably corrupted even noble ends.

### Brahmacharya (Self-Restraint)

Brahmacharya, literally "conduct adapted to the search of Brahma (Truth)," formed the third pillar of Gandhi's spiritual discipline. While commonly translated as celibacy, Gandhi understood brahmacharya more broadly as complete mastery over senses and desires. Sexual abstinence represented one dimension of comprehensive self-control encompassing diet, sleep, entertainment, and material possessions. Gandhi's personal practice of brahmacharya evolved from conventional celibacy within marriage to absolute renunciation of sexual activity after 1906, undertaken as prerequisite for complete dedication to public service. He argued that conservation of sexual energy enabled spiritual power and sustained activism. Brahmacharya also implied voluntary poverty, simple living, and renunciation of unnecessary possessions. Critics questioned Gandhi's later controversial experiments testing his celibacy, which damaged his reputation, though he defended these as scientific trials of his spiritual attainment.

## Relationship to the Bhagavad Gita

The Bhagavad Gita influenced Gandhi more profoundly than any other text, functioning as his "spiritual dictionary" and "unfailing source of strength and solace." He referred to the Gita as his "eternal mother," claiming it offered support exceeding his biological mother's. Gandhi first encountered the Gita in 1888-1889 while studying law in London, reading Edwin Arnold's English translation "The Song Celestial." The text accompanied him throughout his life; he carried a frayed copy everywhere, memorized verses, chanted passages daily, and produced his own Gujarati translation with commentary. Gandhi's interpretation emphasized karma yoga - selfless action without attachment to results (nishkama karma) - as the scripture's essential teaching. He understood the battlefield setting as allegory for internal spiritual warfare rather than justification for physical violence, controversially reading the Gita as fundamentally nonviolent text. This interpretation required explaining away explicit endorsements of Arjuna's duty to fight. Gandhi argued that action without desire for fruits (anasakti) represented the highest spiritual achievement, enabling full engagement with worldly responsibilities while maintaining detachment from outcomes. His ashrams implemented Gita-based disciplines, making textual study inseparable from practical application in communal living, manual labor, and political resistance.

## Practical Spirituality and Daily Discipline

Gandhi's spirituality rejected otherworldly mysticism in favor of rigorous ethical discipline embedded in ordinary activities. He insisted that God appeared "not in person but in action," manifesting through service rather than revelation. This practical orientation shaped every aspect of ashram life. Daily schedules included manual labor - spinning, agricultural work, cleaning latrines - designed to eliminate caste distinctions and cultivate humility. Gandhi championed spinning khadi (hand-woven cloth) as spiritual practice uniting self-sufficiency, economic resistance to British imports, and meditation-like focus. Prayer meetings incorporated readings from multiple scriptures (Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Buddhist), modeling religious pluralism. Dietary restrictions eliminated meat, alcohol, stimulating spices, and eventually most cooked foods, based on beliefs about diet's effects on consciousness and self-control. Fasting served as spiritual discipline, political protest, and self-purification, though critics accused Gandhi of using fasts manipulatively. His experiments with naturopathy, enemas, mud-packs, and unconventional health practices reflected conviction that bodily purity enabled spiritual progress. This integration of spirituality with daily activities, economic production, dietary practice, and political resistance created comprehensive lifestyle oriented toward truth-realization through ordinary actions rather than extraordinary mystical experiences.

## Universal Religious Principles

Gandhi's eclectic religious education - mother from Pranami Vaishnava tradition synthesizing Hindu and Islamic texts, exposure to Jain emphasis on ahimsa, Christian missionary influence, theosophist friendships - shaped his conviction that all religions contained truth while none possessed monopoly on divine realization. He drew inspiration from diverse sources: the Bhagavad Gita, New Testament Sermon on the Mount, Quran, Buddhist sutras, Jain teachings on non-attachment, Sufi poetry, and Sikh scriptures. Western thinkers profoundly influenced his synthesis, particularly Leo Tolstoy's Christian anarchism and critique of institutional religion, John Ruskin's "Unto This Last" challenging industrial capitalism, and Henry David Thoreau's essay "Civil Disobedience" theorizing resistance to unjust government. This religious pluralism grounded Gandhi's vision for independent India as multi-religious society where Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, and others coexisted peacefully. He rejected Hindu nationalism (Hindutva) that privileged Hindu tradition and advocated Muslim exclusion or subordination. Gandhi's assassination by Hindu nationalist Nathuram Godse, who condemned his concessions to Muslims and vision of religious pluralism, demonstrated the deadly opposition his inclusive spirituality provoked. His interfaith prayer meetings, inclusion of Quranic verses in Hindu contexts, and defense of Muslim rights against Hindu majoritarian violence embodied his universal religious ethic, though critics accused him of naively underestimating religious communalism's power.

## Integration of Spirituality and Social Justice

Gandhi's revolutionary contribution lay in demonstrating spiritual practice's inseparability from social transformation. Unlike traditions advocating renunciation of worldly engagement for contemplative realization, Gandhi insisted that service to the poor and oppressed constituted the highest worship. This integration manifested in his dictum that true religion involved serving the hungry and destitute rather than ritualistic observance. The concept of sarvodaya (welfare of all) united spiritual and economic goals, envisioning society organized around collective good rather than individual profit. Gandhi's economic philosophy rejected both capitalism's competitive individualism and state socialism's centralized control, advocating instead for decentralized village-based production, economic self-sufficiency (swadeshi), and trusteeship by the wealthy rather than class warfare. His campaign against untouchability challenged Hinduism's fundamental social structure, arguing that caste hierarchy contradicted genuine spirituality. Gandhi coined the term "Harijan" (children of God) for untouchables, personally cleaned latrines to break caste taboos, and fought for temple entry rights. Critics, particularly B.R. Ambedkar, attacked this paternalistic approach as inadequate compared to radical restructuring of Hindu society or conversion to Buddhism. Gandhi's spiritualized politics transformed Indian nationalism from purely anti-colonial movement into moral crusade for purification of Indian society itself, insisting that swaraj (self-rule) required internal transformation - overcoming caste prejudice, religious communalism, gender discrimination - alongside political independence from Britain.

## Influence on Modern Spiritual Thought and Social Movements

Gandhi's integration of spirituality and nonviolent social action profoundly influenced twentieth-century liberation movements worldwide. Martin Luther King Jr. explicitly adopted Gandhian principles of nonviolent resistance, traveling to India in 1959 and declaring that "while the Montgomery boycott was going on, India's Gandhi was the guiding light of our technique of nonviolent social change." King synthesized satyagraha with Christian theology of redemptive suffering, applying these principles to American civil rights struggle. He stated that "Christ showed us the way and Gandhi in India showed it could work," situating nonviolence within both spiritual tradition and practical political strategy. Activists including John Lewis participated in Gandhian nonviolence workshops led by James Lawson, preparing for lunch counter sit-ins and Freedom Rides. Nelson Mandela studied Gandhi's South African campaigns against discriminatory laws, though Mandela later concluded that violence became necessary when nonviolence failed. The American anti-war movement, Latin American liberation theology, Philippines People Power Revolution, Solidarity movement in Poland, and Tibetan resistance under the Dalai Lama all drew inspiration from Gandhian nonviolence, though with varying degrees of fidelity to his spiritual foundations. Environmental movements embraced Gandhi's critique of industrial civilization, unlimited growth, and material consumption, finding resources in his emphasis on sustainable living, village economy, and harmony with nature. His vision of spirituality manifesting through ethical consumption, manual labor, and simple living challenges contemporary consumerist culture and purely technological approaches to ecological crisis. Critics note that Gandhi's tactics succeeded partly due to British democracy's constraints and moral sensibilities, questioning their applicability against totalitarian regimes willing to use unlimited violence against nonviolent resistance.

## Contemporary Scholarly Reception

Modern scholarship on Gandhi's spirituality remains deeply contested. Postcolonial theorists critique his essentialism about Indian spirituality versus Western materialism, noting how this binary reinforced Orientalist stereotypes while obscuring India's own material concerns and the West's spiritual traditions. Feminist scholars challenge his patriarchal assumptions, particularly treatment of wife Kasturba, opposition to contraception, and idealization of women as naturally nonviolent nurturers. His brahmacharya experiments with young women, including grand-niece Manu, provoke ongoing controversy regarding power dynamics and sexual ethics. Scholars debate whether his spiritualized politics enabled mass mobilization or depoliticized material struggles by framing them in religious terms. Ambedkarite critiques emphasize his inadequate challenge to caste hierarchy and patronizing attitude toward untouchables despite championing their cause. Islamic scholars question whether his Hindu-inflected universalism genuinely respected Islamic difference or attempted cultural assimilation. Despite these critiques, Gandhi's demonstration that religious conviction can generate progressive social change rather than reactionary conservatism offers alternatives to both secular materialism dismissing religion's public role and fundamentalist dogmatism rejecting pluralism. His experimental approach to truth-seeking, willingness to admit error, and integration of personal transformation with collective liberation remain resources for contemporary movements navigating relationships between spirituality, ethics, and political action. The enduring global influence of his writings, particularly compilations like "Path to God" making his thought accessible beyond academic specialists, demonstrates continued relevance for spiritual seekers, activists, and scholars exploring alternatives to violence, materialism, and religious sectarianism.
