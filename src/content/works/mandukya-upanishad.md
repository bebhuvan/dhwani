description: "The Mandukya Upanishad, the shortest principal Upanishad at merely twelve verses, presents extraordinarily concentrated Vedantic philosophy analyzing the sacred syllable Om (AUM) and consciousness's four states—waking, dreaming, deep sleep, and transcendent turiya—establishing frameworks that profoundly influenced Advaita Vedanta, Buddhist philosophy, and consciousness studies. Composed around 5th-4th century BCE, this text belongs to the Atharvaveda and achieved such philosophical density that Gaudapada's 6th century CE Karikas (verses) expanding it became inseparable companion text, while Shankara declared that Mandukya alone suffices for liberation among all Upanishads. The text's systematic analysis correlates Om's three phonetic components (A-U-M) with consciousness states (waking-dreaming-deep sleep) and their corresponding experiential modes (outer awareness, inner awareness, undifferentiated awareness), culminating in silence after Om representing turiya—the fourth state transcending yet underlying other three, consciousness itself unmodified by content. This teaching revolutionized Indian philosophy by providing phenomenological analysis of consciousness while establishing non-dualist metaphysics, influencing Buddhist Madhyamaka dialectics, Yogachara consciousness-only philosophy, and modern Western phenomenology and consciousness studies."
