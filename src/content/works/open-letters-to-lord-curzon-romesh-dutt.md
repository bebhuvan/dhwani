# Open Letters to Lord Curzon on Famines and Land Assessments in India

## Overview

Romesh Chunder Dutt's 358-page volume, published by K. Paul, Trench, Trübner in London (1900), comprises five open letters to Lord Curzon, Viceroy of India, addressing famine relief, railway development, irrigation policy, and land taxation. Writing as a retired Indian civil servant with insider knowledge of British administration and as a historian who had documented India's economic exploitation, Dutt combined empirical data with moral argumentation to critique colonial economic policies that he believed caused recurrent famines and impoverished peasants. The work represents sophisticated Indian nationalist critique of British rule grounded in economic analysis.

## About Romesh Chunder Dutt

Romesh Chunder Dutt (1848-1909) achieved distinction as the first Indian to reach the rank of divisional commissioner in the Indian Civil Service before retiring in 1897. He then became lecturer in Indian History at University College London (1898). His "Economic History of India" is considered a classic nationalist account documenting systematic British economic exploitation. As president of the Indian National Congress (1899), he advocated constitutional reform and economic justice. He died November 30, 1909, in Baroda.

## Historical Context

The 1890s saw devastating famines in India killing millions. The Famine of 1896-97 and subsequent famines prompted debates about British economic policies' role in causing or exacerbating food crises. Lord Curzon's viceroyalty (1899-1905) coincided with ongoing famine conditions and growing Indian nationalist economic critique.

Dutt and other nationalist economists, including Dadabhai Naoroji, argued that British policies—particularly high land revenue demands, promotion of cash crop exports over food production, and inadequate famine insurance—systematically impoverished India and caused preventable famines.

## The Five Letters

**Letter I: Famine Insurance and the Permanent Settlement**
Argues that secure property rights and fixed revenue would enable peasants to invest in agriculture and create famine reserves.

**Letter II: Railways and Irrigation**
Critiques how railway construction served British commercial interests rather than famine prevention, and how inadequate irrigation investment left peasants vulnerable to drought.

**Letter III: Fallacies of Land Revenue Policy**
Challenges official justifications for high land taxation, using statistical evidence to show how revenue demands exceeded productive capacity.

**Letters IV-V: Additional Economic Critiques**
Further arguments supported by appendices containing official statistics, budget data, and comparative international evidence.

## Argumentative Strategy

Dutt's approach combined multiple rhetorical strategies:
- **Empirical Evidence**: Extensive use of official British statistics to support arguments
- **Historical Analysis**: Showing how British policies deviated from Mughal precedents
- **Comparative Method**: Contrasting British Indian policies with those in Britain and other colonies
- **Appeals to Justice**: Moral arguments about Britain's obligations to Indian subjects
- **Insider Authority**: Leveraging his ICS experience to critique administrative failures

This methodology made his critique difficult for British officials to dismiss as uninformed nationalism.

## Impact and Legacy

The letters influenced British policy debates and nationalist economic thinking. While immediate policy changes were limited, Dutt's work shaped nationalist economic analysis that would inform post-independence development policies. His documentation of colonial economic exploitation became standard nationalist historiography.

Modern economic historians debate Dutt's interpretations, with some scholars questioning whether British policies alone caused famines or whether other factors (population growth, agricultural practices) also contributed. Nevertheless, his systematic critique of colonial economic policies remains influential in understanding Indo-British economic relationships.

## Digital Preservation

This 358-page work has been digitized and is freely accessible through the Internet Archive, providing scholars access to this important Indian nationalist economic critique of colonial policy and Dutt's sophisticated use of empirical data to support political arguments.
