# Ancient Ballads and Legends of Hindustan

## Overview

Published posthumously in 1882, five years after Toru Dutt's death from tuberculosis at age twenty-one, *Ancient Ballads and Legends of Hindustan* represents a remarkable achievement in early Indo-Anglian literature—poetry by Indians writing in English. The collection's sixteen narrative poems adapted mythological tales from the Mahabharata, Ramayana, and Vishnu Purana into English ballad form, combining Victorian poetic conventions with Indian emotional registers, moral frameworks, and devotional sensibilities.

Toru's brief but extraordinary life trajectory shaped this unique literary synthesis. Born into an elite Bengali Christian family that valued Western education, she spent formative years (1869-1873) in Europe studying literature and languages. Returning to Calcutta at age seventeen, she immersed herself in Sanskrit study with the intensity of someone racing against time—indeed, tuberculosis was already claiming her siblings and would soon take her own life. In just four years, she mastered Sanskrit sufficiently to engage epic and Puranic literature, translating selected narratives into English verse that demonstrated both technical poetic skill and profound understanding of the source materials' theological and emotional depths.

Her literary achievement was threefold: proving that Indian subjects could sustain sophisticated English poetry comparable to European traditions; asserting indigenous cultural pride and Sanskrit learning's value against colonial hierarchies that dismissed Indian literature as inferior; and pioneering a distinctive Indo-Anglian voice that was neither imitative colonial mimicry nor defensive cultural nationalism but genuine bicultural synthesis. Writing as an Indian woman in the colonizer's language about Hindu mythological subjects, Toru navigated complex identity negotiations that would define Indo-Anglian literature for generations.

The collection appeared with an introductory memoir by Edmund Gosse, the influential English critic and poet who championed Toru's work after her death. Gosse's appreciation—combining genuine literary admiration with Orientalist exoticism about the "wonderful Hindu girl"—helped establish Toru's posthumous reputation while also framing her within Victorian assumptions about Eastern spirituality and feminine fragility.

## About Toru Dutt (1856-1877)

### Bengali Christian Elite and European Education

Born in Calcutta on March 4, 1856, Toru Dutt belonged to the Bengali *bhadralok* (educated gentry)—her father Govindu Chandra Dutt served as a magistrate in British administration. The family's conversion to Christianity reflected broader currents among educated Bengalis engaging Christian missions, Western learning, and social reform, though their Christianity incorporated continuing appreciation for Hindu cultural heritage.

Toru's education was extraordinary for a 19th-century Indian girl. Her father, committed to modern education, engaged tutors for instruction in Bengali, English, and eventually Sanskrit. In 1869, when Toru was thirteen, the family embarked on a four-year European sojourn, spending extensive periods in France and England. In France, Toru and her sister Aru learned French; in England, they attended the "Higher Lectures for Women" at Cambridge—though as females and Indians, formal university matriculation remained impossible.

This European education immersed Toru in English and French literature. She mastered both languages, reading voraciously—Milton, Wordsworth, Tennyson in English; Hugo, Lamartine, de Musset in French. She absorbed Victorian poetic conventions, Romantic sensibilities, and European literary aesthetics that would profoundly influence her own writing.

### Return to India and Sanskrit Immersion

Returning to Calcutta in 1873, the family faced tragedy. Toru's brother Abju died shortly after their return; her beloved sister Aru died in 1874. These losses, combined with Toru's own declining health (tuberculosis symptoms appearing by 1875), created an atmosphere of grief and urgency.

In this context, Toru turned intensively to Sanskrit study. Working with a pandit (traditional Sanskrit scholar), she mastered the language with remarkable speed, driven by what Gosse called "an almost superhuman rapidity" born of knowing time was short. She plunged into epic and Puranic literature—the Mahabharata, Ramayana, Bhagavata Purana, Vishnu Purana—seeking connection to her cultural heritage that European education had made simultaneously foreign and precious.

This Sanskrit immersion wasn't rejection of her European learning but synthesis. She approached Sanskrit texts with literary sensibilities honed through English and French reading, recognizing epic narratives' dramatic potential, psychological depth, and moral complexity. Her goal became translating these materials into English poetry that would reveal their beauty and power to Western readers while asserting their equal standing with European literary traditions.

### Literary Production and Tragic Early Death

Despite failing health, Toru produced an astonishing literary output in her final years:

**French Translations** (1876): *A Sheaf Gleaned in French Fields*—translations of French poetry into English, published during her lifetime

**French Novel** (posthumous, 1879): *Le Journal de Mademoiselle d'Arvers*—a novel in French, demonstrating her multilingual facility

**Sanskrit Adaptations** (posthumous, 1882): *Ancient Ballads and Legends of Hindustan*—the work under discussion

**English Novel** (posthumous, 1878): *Bianca, or The Young Spanish Maiden*—an incomplete novel

Toru died on August 30, 1877, aged twenty-one years, six months, and twenty-six days. Her father collected and published her Sanskrit ballads posthumously, with Edmund Gosse providing the introductory memoir that brought them to wider attention.

## Poetic Adaptation: From Sanskrit Narrative to English Ballad

### Source Materials and Selection

Toru drew on three major Sanskrit sources:

**Mahabharata**: The massive epic (100,000 verses) recounting the Bharata dynasty's fratricidal war. She selected focused episodes with strong dramatic and moral content—Savitri's devotion outwitting death, Ekalavya's (Buttoo's) sacrificial guru-bhakti.

**Ramayana**: Valmiki's epic of Prince Rama's exile and battle against demon king Ravana. Toru focused on Lakshman's fraternal loyalty and sacrifice.

**Vishnu Purana**: Encyclopedic text covering cosmology, mythology, and devotional traditions. She adapted stories like Prahlad's unwavering faith despite his demon father's persecution.

Her selection criteria emphasized:
- Strong narrative drama suitable for ballad treatment
- Moral and devotional themes resonating with Victorian values (self-sacrifice, faith, duty)
- Psychologically complex characters capable of emotional depth
- Stories demonstrating Hindu tradition's ethical sophistication

### Ballad Form and Victorian Poetics

The ballad—a narrative poem in quatrains with regular meter and rhyme—had experienced Victorian revival through Romantic and Pre-Raphaelite poets (Wordsworth, Coleridge, Tennyson, Rossetti). Toru adopted this form for her Sanskrit adaptations, using:

- **Regular Meter**: Primarily iambic tetrameter or pentameter, creating rhythmic forward momentum
- **Rhyme Schemes**: Various patterns (ABAB, ABCB) providing musical closure
- **Stanzaic Structure**: Quatrains enabling episodic narrative development
- **Dialogue and Direct Speech**: Dramatizing character interactions
- **Descriptive Detail**: Vivid imagery establishing settings and moods

This formal apparatus was thoroughly Victorian, yet Toru inflected it with distinctively Indian elements—emotional intensity, devotional fervor, and moral seriousness differing in tone from typical Victorian balladry.

### Translation vs. Adaptation

Toru's approach was creative adaptation rather than literal translation. She:

- Condensed lengthy Sanskrit narratives into focused ballad-length poems
- Selected dramatically significant episodes from sprawling epics
- Added dialogue and psychological interiority absent or minimal in sources
- Employed Victorian descriptive techniques and imagery
- Maintained core narrative events while reshaping presentation for English verse

This adaptive approach paralleled how Tennyson adapted Arthurian legends or Rossetti reworked medieval Italian narratives—treating sources as raw material for original poetic creation rather than texts requiring faithful reproduction.

## Major Poems and Themes

### "Savitri" (from Mahabharata)

Perhaps Toru's finest achievement, "Savitri" retells the Mahabharata episode where Savitri's devotion and cleverness outwit Yama (Death) to reclaim her husband Satyavan's life. Toru's version emphasizes:

- **Female Agency**: Savitri's active, intelligent, determined character
- **Conjugal Devotion**: Love transcending death through moral force
- **Philosophical Dialogue**: Savitri debating with Yama about duty and justice
- **Triumphant Resolution**: Virtue rewarded, death defeated

The poem demonstrated that Hindu narratives could sustain complex characterization and moral philosophy, countering stereotypes about Indian literature as exotic fantasy lacking psychological depth.

### "Lakshman" (from Ramayana)

This poem focuses on Lakshman's fraternal devotion to Rama during forest exile, particularly the episode where Lakshman, grievously wounded in battle, faces death. Toru explores:

- **Fraternal Love**: Lakshman's selfless dedication to Rama
- **Heroic Sacrifice**: Willingness to die protecting his brother
- **Divine Intervention**: Hanuman's desperate quest for healing herbs
- **Familial Bonds**: Family loyalty as supreme moral value

### "Prahlad" (from Vishnu Purana)

The story of the demon-prince Prahlad, who despite his father Hiranyakashipu's persecution maintains unwavering devotion to Vishnu, provided Toru opportunity to explore:

- **Faith Against Oppression**: Maintaining religious conviction despite deadly threats
- **Divine Protection**: Vishnu's intervention protecting true devotees
- **Parent-Child Conflict**: Tragic opposition between father and son over religious allegiance
- **Ultimate Justice**: Evil punished, devotion vindicated

### "Buttoo" (from Mahabharata—Ekalavya Episode)

This poem retells the heartbreaking story of Ekalavya (Buttoo), the tribal archer whose guru-bhakti (devotion to teacher) leads him to cut off his thumb when his guru Dronacharya demands it as *dakshina* (teaching fee). Toru's treatment addresses:

- **Guru-Disciple Relationship**: Traditional Indian education's sacred bond
- **Caste Injustice**: Dronacharya's request motivated by desire to preserve his upper-caste pupil Arjuna's superiority
- **Tragic Sacrifice**: Buttoo's selfless renunciation destroying his own talent
- **Moral Ambiguity**: Complex ethics where devotion, duty, and justice conflict

## Literary Achievement and Cultural Significance

### Pioneering Indo-Anglian Voice

Toru's work established several precedents for Indian English literature:

**Bicultural Synthesis**: Demonstrating that deep engagement with both Western and Indian traditions could produce original literary achievement rather than derivative imitation

**Sanskrit Content in English Form**: Proving Indian mythological and religious materials could sustain sophisticated English poetry comparable to European traditions

**Female Authorship**: A woman claiming literary authority in male-dominated spheres of both Indian Sanskrit learning and English letters

**Cultural Pride and Assertion**: Presenting Indian traditions not as exotic curiosities but as possessing equal aesthetic and moral value to Western traditions

### Victorian Reception and Orientalism

Edmund Gosse's influential memoir framed Toru through Orientalist lenses—the "wonderful Hindu girl," exotic feminine fragility, spiritual Eastern wisdom—that both celebrated and constrained her achievement. Victorian readers appreciated her work's:

- **Exotic Appeal**: Indian subjects providing romantic distance and fantasy
- **Moral Uplift**: Stories demonstrating self-sacrifice, faith, and duty resonated with Victorian values
- **Feminine Sensibility**: Poetry by a young woman aligned with Victorian femininity ideals
- **Tragic Biography**: Early death from consumption fit Romantic/Victorian tragic genius mythology

This reception both enabled Toru's posthumous fame and reduced her complex achievement to easily digestible stereotypes about Eastern spirituality and feminine fragility.

### Indian Nationalist Appropriation

Later Indian nationalist readers claimed Toru as cultural hero:

- Demonstrating Indians could master colonizer's language while maintaining cultural roots
- Asserting Sanskrit tradition's continuing vitality and relevance
- Proving Indian intellectual and artistic equality to Europeans
- Modeling bicultural identity that could navigate modernity without cultural surrender

Yet this appropriation sometimes ignored Toru's Christian identity and European literary influences, fashioning her into simpler symbol of indigenous cultural resistance.

## Critical Perspectives

### Feminist Readings

Contemporary feminist scholars recognize Toru's complex negotiations:

**Literary Authority**: Claiming space in male-dominated literary worlds (both Sanskrit scholarship and English poetry)

**Cultural Mediation**: Translating between patriarchal traditions (Victorian England, traditional Hinduism)

**Female Subjects**: Her poems often center strong female characters (Savitri, Sita in other poems) demonstrating women's agency and moral force

**Biographical Constraints**: Her tragically short life and inability to fully develop her literary potential

### Postcolonial Analysis

Postcolonial critics examine how Toru's work navigated colonial power dynamics:

**Linguistic Colonization**: Writing in the colonizer's language while asserting indigenous content

**Cultural Translation**: Mediating between cultures in context of unequal power relations

**Hybrid Identity**: Navigating Bengali, Christian, Western-educated, female, and Indian identities

**Strategic Essentialism**: Emphasizing Hindu cultural heritage for anti-colonial cultural assertion

### Literary Historical Significance

Toru's work represents crucial transitional moment in Indian literature:

- From traditional Sanskrit/vernacular writing to English-language Indian literature
- From colonial mimicry to bicultural synthesis
- From male to female literary authority
- From exclusively Brahmanical to broader accessibility through English

## Contemporary Relevance

### Founding Figure of Indo-Anglian Literature

Toru is recognized as pioneering figure establishing precedents for:
- Salman Rushdie, Arundhati Roy, Jhumpa Lahiri—Indian English novelists
- Kamala Das, Nissim Ezekiel, A.K. Ramanujan—Indian English poets
- Entire tradition of Indian writing in English

### Translation and Adaptation Studies

Her work raises enduring questions about:
- Translating between radically different literary traditions
- Adaptation's creative possibilities and losses
- Cultural ownership and interpretive authority
- Hybrid literary forms emerging from bicultural engagement

### Women's Literary History

Toru joins global 19th-century women writers—Brontës, Dickinson, Barrett Browning—who claimed literary authority despite gender constraints, while her specific negotiations differ given colonial and cultural contexts.
