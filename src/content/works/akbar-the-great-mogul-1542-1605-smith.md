# Akbar the Great Mogul, 1542-1605

## Overview

Published in 1917, Vincent Arthur Smith's biography of Akbar stands as the definitive English-language study of India's most celebrated emperor. Smith, combining decades of Indian Civil Service experience with rigorous historical scholarship, presents Akbar's transformation of the Mughal Empire from precarious kingdom into South Asia's dominant power through military conquest, administrative innovation, and revolutionary religious policy.

The work chronicles Akbar's rise from thirteen-year-old ruler inheriting chaos to the emperor who consolidated Mughal control over northern and central India, established efficient governance, promoted religious tolerance unprecedented in his time, and patronized an extraordinary cultural flowering. Smith balances admiration for Akbar's achievements with critical analysis of his autocracy, military brutality, and the contradictions between his tolerant ideals and political pragmatism.

## Akbar's Reign and Achievements

Akbar ruled from 1556 to 1605, a reign that fundamentally reshaped Indian history. Inheriting a fragile kingdom from his father Humayun, the young emperor faced Rajput resistance, Afghan challenges, and internal court intrigue. Through military skill, political acumen, and the guidance of regent Bairam Khan, Akbar secured his throne and began systematic expansion.

His conquests brought Gujarat, Bengal, Kashmir, and large parts of the Deccan under Mughal control. But Akbar recognized that conquest alone couldn't sustain empire—he needed legitimacy, efficient administration, and the cooperation of India's diverse populations, particularly the Hindu majority.

**Religious Policy**: Akbar's most revolutionary innovation was religious tolerance. He abolished the jizya tax on non-Muslims, married Rajput princesses (giving their families high positions), invited scholars of all faiths to debates, and eventually proclaimed Din-i-Ilahi—a syncretic "Divine Faith" combining elements of Islam, Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, and Christianity. While this personal religion failed to gain followers, it symbolized Akbar's radical openness.

**Administrative Reforms**: The mansabdari system rationalized military and civil administration, assigning ranks (mansabs) based on service rather than heredity. Revenue reforms under finance minister Todar Mal created systematic land assessment and tax collection, funding imperial expansion while theoretically reducing peasant exploitation.

**Cultural Patronage**: Akbar's court became a center of Indo-Persian culture. Persian and Sanskrit scholars translated texts; artists developed Mughal miniature painting blending Persian, Indian, and European influences; architects created Fatehpur Sikri, the short-lived capital showcasing architectural synthesis; musicians developed traditions blending Persian and Indian modes.

## Smith's Biographical Approach

Smith structures the biography chronologically while analyzing thematic developments—military campaigns, administrative evolution, religious policy shifts, and cultural achievements. Drawing on Persian chronicles (Abul Fazl's *Akbarnama* and *Ain-i-Akbari*), Jesuit accounts, Rajput sources, and archaeological evidence, he reconstructs Akbar's reign with scholarly rigor.

The portrait that emerges is complex: a brilliant, charismatic autocrat capable of extraordinary vision and appalling cruelty; a religious seeker genuinely interested in spiritual truth and a cynical politician using tolerance to consolidate power; a patron of learning who remained illiterate; a champion of women's rights (abolishing sati in some regions, restricting child marriage) who maintained a vast harem.

Smith admires Akbar while avoiding hagiography. He documents massacres of defeated enemies, the emperor's vindictiveness toward perceived traitors, and the limits of his tolerance (which never extended to political dissent). Yet Smith concludes that Akbar's achievements—creating a stable, relatively just administration and fostering Hindu-Muslim cooperation—mark him as one of history's great rulers.

##Critical Perspective

Smith's 1917 biography reflects colonial-era assumptions about "enlightened despotism" and the civilizing potential of strong rulers. His comparison of Akbar to European monarchs like Henry IV of France positions the Mughal in Western historical frameworks. The emphasis on top-down political history marginalizes ordinary people's experiences.

Yet Smith's work remains valuable. His use of multiple source traditions, willingness to critique as well as praise, and attention to administrative detail provide substantialhistorical analysis. The book documents not just Akbar but early 20th-century British understanding of Mughal India—how colonial scholars grappled with the reality that India had experienced sophisticated, successful indigenous governance.

## Legacy

Smith's *Akbar the Great Mogul* shaped English-language understanding of the emperor for decades. Subsequent biographies by Indian and Western scholars have added new interpretations, sources, and theoretical frameworks, but Smith's work established the foundation. For students of Mughal history, Smith remains essential—both for his historical insights and as artifact of colonial historiography at its most sophisticated.
