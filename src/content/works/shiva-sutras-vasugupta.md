description: "The Shiva Sutras represent Kashmir Shaivism's foundational text, presenting non-dual Shaiva philosophy through 77 cryptic aphorisms revealed to sage Vasugupta addressing consciousness as Shiva, recognition (pratyabhijna) as liberation path, and spontaneous divine nature's realization. Composed around 9th century CE, these profound sutras establish Trika philosophy's framework: consciousness (Shiva) as sole reality containing all manifestation as self-expression, individual limitation through maya creating apparent bondage, and liberation through recognizing one's essential Shiva-nature already present. The three sections (unmesa—awakening, shaktopaya—energy-means, anavopaya—individual-means) present progressive paths from direct recognition through energy practices to gradual individual effort, accommodating different spiritual capacities. Beyond cryptic aphorisms, commentaries (especially Kshemaraja's Vimarsini) elaborate profound philosophy: consciousness's dynamic self-awareness (vimarsha), absolute freedom (svatantrya), and world as consciousness's creative pulsation (spanda). The work profoundly influenced Kashmir Shaivism establishing it as sophisticated non-dual philosophy rivaling Advaita Vedanta while offering distinctive emphasis on consciousness's dynamic creative nature, divine embodiment, and aesthetic-mystical realization."
