# A Fascinating Traitor: An Anglo-Indian Story

## Description

Colonel Richard Henry Savage's novel follows Major Alan Hawke, a financially ruined former officer, through encounters in Geneva and his eventual entanglement with wealthy characters and romantic intrigue. The narrative explores themes of ambition, financial desperation, and the shifting boundaries between loyalty and betrayal within the colonial officer class. Savage constructs a complex web of character relationships that challenge the protagonist's moral position.

## Plot Framework

Hawke's crisis of conscience unfolds across multiple encounters: his suicidal despair feeding swans at Lake Leman, a fortuitous card game with Captain Anstruther, and involvement with the mysterious and attractive woman associated with the wealthy Hugh Johnstone. Each meeting escalates the stakes in Hawke's precarious situation.

## Thematic Elements

The novel examines the psychology of moral compromise in colonial contexts, where economic pressures and social ambitions drive characters toward deception. Savage's treatment of "fascination" as both psychological allure and moral trap demonstrates late 19th-century anxieties about imperial society and individual honor.
