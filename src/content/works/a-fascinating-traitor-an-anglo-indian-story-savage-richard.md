description: 'A Fascinating Traitor: An Anglo-Indian Story represents a significant
  late 19th-century literary exploration of colonial Indian social dynamics, published
  during the height of British imperial presence in India. Written by Richard Savage,
  an English author engaging with the complex cultural intersections of the Anglo-Indian
  experience, the novel emerges from a period of intense cultural negotiation and
  colonial administrative transformation. Set against the backdrop of British colonial
  administration in India, the work critically examines the intricate relationships
  between British colonizers and Indian inhabitants, particularly focusing on themes
  of cultural identity, betrayal, and the moral ambiguities inherent in colonial social
  structures. The narrative likely reflects the emergent genre of Anglo-Indian literature,
  which sought to document and interpret the nuanced human experiences within the
  colonial system. While specific plot details are limited, the work appears to interrogate
  notions of loyalty, cultural displacement, and the psychological complexities faced
  by individuals navigating the boundaries between British and Indian societal norms.
  As a literary artifact, the text contributes to scholarly understanding of late
  Victorian representations of colonial interactions, providing insights into the
  racial, social, and psychological tensions characteristic of the imperial encounter.
  Its publication in 1888 coincides with a critical period of Indian social and political
  transformation, making it a valuable historical document for researchers exploring
  colonial literature, cross-cultural interactions, and the discursive practices that
  shaped metropolitan and colonial understandings of identity and power. The work
  offers contemporary scholars a nuanced window into the literary articulations of
  colonial experience during a pivotal moment in Indo-British cultural history.

# A Fascinating Traitor: An Anglo-Indian Story

## Description

Colonel Richard Henry Savage's novel follows Major Alan Hawke, a financially ruined former officer, through encounters in Geneva and his eventual entanglement with wealthy characters and romantic intrigue. The narrative explores themes of ambition, financial desperation, and the shifting boundaries between loyalty and betrayal within the colonial officer class. Savage constructs a complex web of character relationships that challenge the protagonist's moral position.

## Plot Framework

Hawke's crisis of conscience unfolds across multiple encounters: his suicidal despair feeding swans at Lake Leman, a fortuitous card game with Captain Anstruther, and involvement with the mysterious and attractive woman associated with the wealthy Hugh Johnstone. Each meeting escalates the stakes in Hawke's precarious situation.

## Thematic Elements

The novel examines the psychology of moral compromise in colonial contexts, where economic pressures and social ambitions drive characters toward deception. Savage's treatment of "fascination" as both psychological allure and moral trap demonstrates late 19th-century anxieties about imperial society and individual honor.
