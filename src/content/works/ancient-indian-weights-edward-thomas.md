# Ancient Indian Weights

## Overview

Edward Thomas' 1874 study examines ancient Indian systems of weights, documenting measurement standards used in commerce, administration, and daily life across different historical periods and regions. Published by Tr√ºbner in London as part of the International Numismata Orientalia series, this 100-page work combines numismatic evidence (weight standards visible in coinage) with textual sources and archaeological finds to reconstruct Indian metrological systems. Thomas' interdisciplinary approach linking numismatics, metrology, and economic history provided methodological models for subsequent research on ancient trade and administration.

## About Edward Thomas

Edward Thomas CIE FRS (1813-1886) was an English civil servant and Indologist who made groundbreaking contributions to numismatics and Indian historical studies. Elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1871 and awarded the Order of the Indian Empire in 1884, Thomas pioneered study of Bactrian, Indo-Scythic, and Sassanian coins, establishing chronologies and historical interpretations that influenced subsequent scholarship. His work on weights connected numismatic research to broader questions about ancient Indian commerce and administration.

## Metrological Systems

The study documents weight standards including:
- Vedic-period references to measurement units
- Mauryan imperial standards (as reflected in Arthashastra)
- Regional variations in weight systems
- Evolution of standards across dynasties
- Relationships between Indian and Greek/Persian systems

Thomas analyzed how weight standards reflected political authority (rulers issuing standard weights), facilitated commerce (merchants requiring consistent measures), and enabled taxation (revenue collection depending on measurement standards).

## Numismatic Evidence

Coins provide crucial evidence for weight standards because coin weight often corresponded to specific value units. Thomas examined:
- Punch-marked coins and their weight ranges
- Indo-Greek coins showing Hellenistic influences
- Kushan and Gupta coinage weight standards
- Regional coin series and their metrology

Variations in coin weights revealed both intended standards and actual practices, documenting the gap between official regulations and commercial realities.

## Historical Significance

This work contributed to understanding ancient Indian economic history, trade networks, and administrative systems. Weight standards enabled long-distance trade, facilitated taxation, and reflected political authority. Thomas' documentation of these systems provided evidence for commercial sophistication and administrative capacity in ancient Indian states.
