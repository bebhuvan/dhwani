# Historical Fragments of the Mogul Empire

## Overview
*Historical Fragments* expands on Robert Orme’s official histories with closely observed narratives of the Mughal decline and the rise of regional powers in India. Drawing on Company correspondence and eyewitness testimony, Orme recounts sieges, treaties, and the mercantile ambitions that set British fortunes against established South Asian sovereignties.

## Highlights
The volume offers granular detail on the English settlements at Surat and Broach, the strategic calculations of the Marathas, and the administrative structures the Company encountered while extending inland from coastal trading posts. Appendices reproduce key documents, giving readers access to the voices of imperial officials and Indian rulers alike.

## Access Notes
The Internet Archive scan provides searchable text, high-quality PDF downloads, and a navigable table of contents, allowing historians to trace individual campaigns or track the vocabulary of early Company bureaucracy.
