# The Historical Inscriptions of Southern India

## Posthumous Publication and Editorial Context

The Historical Inscriptions of Southern India appeared in 1932 as part of the Madras University Historical Series, seven years after Robert Sewell's death in 1925. Madras University's history department undertook publication as part of its mandate to preserve and disseminate documentary sources for South Indian history. The volume compiled Sewell's decades of epigraphic work documenting inscriptions across the Madras Presidency and princely states of southern India, organizing material he had collected and translated during his colonial administrative career and subsequent research.

The work represented culmination of Sewell's epigraphic scholarship begun during his service in the Madras Civil Service (1870s-1900) and continued through his retirement years. His earlier publications including A Forgotten Empire: Vijayanagar (1900) and The Indian Calendar (1896, with Sankara Balkrishna Dikshit) had established his reputation for meticulous documentary research and epigraphic analysis. This posthumous volume synthesized his inscriptional documentation, providing researchers with compiled translations and historical annotations previously scattered across journal articles, administrative reports, and unpublished notes.

Madras University's editorial intervention ensured standardized presentation and organization. The volume included inscriptions collected through 1923, representing the endpoint of Sewell's active research before declining health limited his scholarly work in his final years. The inclusion of "Outlines of Political History" provided chronological framework connecting epigraphic evidence to dynastic narratives and regional political developments, enabling readers to contextualize individual inscriptions within broader historical sequences.

## Geographical and Linguistic Scope

The compilation addressed inscriptions from territories constituting the Madras Presidency: modern Tamil Nadu, coastal Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka's southern and eastern districts, and Kerala. This geographical scope reflected administrative boundaries of colonial Madras rather than cultural-linguistic zones, incorporating diverse epigraphic traditions across Dravidian and Sanskrit linguistic domains. Coverage extended from Pallava-era inscriptions (sixth century CE) through late medieval and early modern periods, documenting over a millennium of epigraphic practice.

Linguistic diversity characterized the corpus. Tamil inscriptions predominated in northern Tamil Nadu, documenting Chola, Pandya, and later Vijayanagara administration. Telugu inscriptions covered Andhra regions and inland Karnataka districts where Telugu served as administrative language under Kakatiya and later dynasties. Kannada inscriptions documented Chalukya, Rashtrakuta, Hoysala, and Vijayanagara territories across Karnataka. Sanskrit inscriptions appeared across all regions, particularly in temple contexts and royal genealogical proclamations. Sewell provided English translations with notes on paleographic features, dating criteria, and historical interpretations.

The work organized material geographically by district, enabling systematic consultation for regional histories. Entries documented inscription location (temple, monument, village), physical characteristics (stone, copper plate), script (Tamil, Grantha, Telugu, Kannada variants), language, and dating evidence. This standardized documentation facilitated comparison across regions and periods, supporting historical analysis of administrative practices, religious patronage patterns, and cultural transmission.

## Content Categories and Historical Evidence

Inscriptions documented multiple aspects of medieval South Indian society. Royal proclamations announced military victories, territorial acquisitions, and genealogical claims connecting rulers to legendary or divine ancestors. These inscriptions served legitimation functions, projecting royal authority through inscribed declarations at temples and public monuments. Sewell's translations and annotations evaluated historical reliability, distinguishing plausible claims from legendary elaborations.

Land grant inscriptions (sasanas) recorded royal donations of villages and agricultural lands to temples, Brahmins, and religious institutions. These detailed records specified boundaries, tax exemptions, and administrative arrangements, providing evidence for agrarian organization, revenue systems, and religious patronage. Sewell extracted data on land measurement units, crop types, tax rates, and village administration, enabling economic historians to reconstruct medieval agrarian structures.

Temple inscriptions documented construction activities, endowments for religious services, and administrative arrangements for temple management. These records illuminated ritual economy: specifications for daily worship, festival celebrations, lamp-lighting endowments, and feeding arrangements. The inscriptions revealed social participation in temple patronage, with donations from merchants, artisans, and local communities alongside royal contributions. Sewell's annotations identified temples, gods, and ritual practices mentioned, connecting epigraphic evidence to living religious traditions.

Merchant guild inscriptions, particularly from Chola territories, documented trade networks, merchant associations (such as the Ayyavole guild), and commercial regulations. These inscriptions appeared at ports, markets, and along trade routes, revealing economic connections extending from South India to Southeast Asia. Sewell's work documented these mercantile inscriptions, contributing to understanding of medieval Indian Ocean trade.

## Chronological and Dynastic Organization

Beyond geographical arrangement, Sewell provided chronological outlines organizing inscriptions by dynasty and reign. This framework enabled tracking dynastic successions, reign lengths, and territorial changes over time. The outline sections synthesized inscriptional evidence with information from literary sources and numismatic evidence, constructing political narratives connecting epigraphic documentation to historical sequences.

Chola inscriptions received extensive coverage, documenting the dynasty's imperial expansion (tenth-thirteenth centuries), administrative sophistication, and cultural patronage. Sewell's chronological outline traced Chola kings' reigns, major conquests, and administrative innovations documented through inscriptions. The material illuminated Chola state organization, including the famous village assemblies (sabhas) whose proceedings appeared in temple wall inscriptions.

Vijayanagara inscriptions, reflecting Sewell's longstanding research interest, documented the empire's administration (fourteenth-seventeenth centuries) across its vast territories. The inscriptions revealed administrative hierarchy, revenue arrangements, and the empire's role as patron of temples and infrastructure across South India. Sewell's earlier work on Vijayanagara combined with this systematic epigraphic documentation provided comprehensive picture of the empire's historical significance.

Hoysala, Pandya, Kakatiya, and other dynasties received systematic treatment, with inscriptions documenting their political histories, administrative practices, and cultural contributions. The chronological organization enabled comparative analysis of administrative systems, religious patronage patterns, and cultural developments across medieval South Indian polities.

## Methodology and Epigraphic Standards

Sewell's methodology reflected late nineteenth and early twentieth century epigraphic practice as established by the Archaeological Survey of India and Madras Epigraphical Department. He employed paleographic analysis for dating, comparing script forms across inscriptions to establish chronological sequences. Regnal years in inscriptions connected to known dynastic chronologies enabled absolute dating, while undated inscriptions received approximate dating through paleographic comparison and historical context.

Translation practice balanced literal accuracy with historical interpretation. Sewell provided English renderings that conveyed inscriptions' content while annotating technical terms, place names, and obscure references. His annotations identified historical persons, explained administrative terminology, and connected inscriptional evidence to known historical events. This interpretive approach made inscriptions accessible to historians lacking specialized linguistic and paleographic training.

The work's limitations reflected its era: incomplete coverage (new inscriptions continued being discovered), occasionally outdated interpretations (revised by subsequent scholarship), and colonial-era assumptions about Indian history. Nonetheless, Sewell's translations and documentation preserved access to inscriptions subsequently lost or damaged, maintaining research value despite later advances in epigraphic methodology and historical interpretation.

## Impact on South Indian Historiography

Sewell's compilation became standard reference for South Indian medieval history through the mid-twentieth century. Historians of Chola, Vijayanagara, and other dynasties relied on his translations and chronological frameworks. The work's systematic geographical organization facilitated regional histories, while chronological outlines provided frameworks for synthetic political narratives.

Post-independence Indian scholarship built upon Sewell's foundation while critiquing colonial-era interpretations and expanding epigraphic coverage. The Archaeological Survey of India's continued epigraphical publications, particularly the South Indian Inscriptions series and Annual Report on Indian Epigraphy, incorporated new discoveries and revised readings. However, Sewell's work remained valuable for inscriptions he documented that were subsequently lost or whose locations became inaccessible.

The volume influenced historical methodology by demonstrating inscriptions' value for social and economic history beyond political narratives. Later scholars expanded on Sewell's documentation of land grants and temple inscriptions to analyze medieval agrarian systems, religious institutions, and economic organization. His merchant guild inscriptions contributed to Indian Ocean trade histories, while his temple inscriptions informed studies of medieval Hinduism's institutional development.

## Author Background

Robert Sewell (1845-1925) joined the Madras Civil Service in the 1870s, serving in revenue and judicial roles across Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. District-level administrative work exposed him to local historical traditions, temple archives, and inscriptional documentation. His administrative responsibilities included land settlement operations requiring understanding of historical tenure patterns, stimulating interest in documentary evidence including inscriptions and copper plate grants.

Following retirement around 1900, Sewell devoted himself to historical research, collaborating with Indian scholars and the Madras Epigraphical Department. His publications ranged across South Indian history, chronology, and epigraphy. A Forgotten Empire: Vijayanagar synthesized Portuguese accounts, inscriptions, and site archaeology to reconstruct the empire's history. The Indian Calendar (co-authored with S.B. Dikshit) provided tools for converting Indian calendrical dates to European equivalents, enabling precise historical chronology. Lists of Antiquarian Remains in the Presidency of Madras cataloged archaeological sites and monuments, supporting conservation efforts.

Sewell's scholarship exhibited colonial-era characteristics: focus on political history and dynastic succession; administrative perspective emphasizing revenue systems and territorial organization; and collaboration with European and Indian scholars within colonial institutional frameworks. Despite these limitations, his meticulous documentation, linguistic competence across multiple South Indian languages, and sustained engagement with primary sources produced works retaining research value beyond their colonial-era origins.
