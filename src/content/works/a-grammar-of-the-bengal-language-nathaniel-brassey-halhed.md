  Nathaniel Brassey Halhed's "A Grammar of the Bengal Language" represents a pivotal scholarly work in the early linguistic documentation of colonial India during the late 18th century. Published in 1778, the grammar emerged during a critical period of British East India Company's expanding linguistic and administrative engagement with Bengal, then a complex cultural and administrative region. Halhed, a British orientalist and philologist, compiled this groundbreaking work while serving as a Company official, drawing extensively on collaborative research with local scholars and pandits in Calcutta (now Kolkata). The text is notable for being among the first comprehensive systematic grammatical analyses of Bengali produced by a European scholar, offering detailed examination of linguistic structures, syntax, and morphological characteristics of the language. Beyond its linguistic significance, the grammar serves as a critical historical document illuminating the intellectual exchanges and cultural translation occurring during the early phases of British colonial interactions with Indian linguistic traditions. Halhed's methodology, which incorporated direct consultation with indigenous language experts, distinguished his work from earlier, more superficial European linguistic studies. The grammar not only provided a sophisticated framework for understanding Bengali but also reflected the emerging scholarly interest in Indian languages within Orientalist academic circles. Its publication marked an important moment in comparative linguistics, representing a nuanced approach to understanding Indian language systems that went beyond mere instrumental colonial administrative requirements. For contemporary scholars, the work offers rich insights into late 18th-century linguistic scholarship, colonial knowledge production, and the complex intellectual dialogues between European and Indian scholarly traditions.

# A Grammar of the Bengal Language

## Overview

A Grammar of the Bengal Language, published in 1778 by Nathaniel Brassey Halhed, represents a landmark in both colonial linguistics and Bengali printing history. This pioneering work was the first comprehensive grammar of Bengali compiled by a European scholar and the first book printed in Bengali using movable type. Commissioned by Warren Hastings, Governor-General of Bengal, it exemplifies the intersection of linguistic scholarship, colonial administration, and technological innovation in late eighteenth-century British India.

## Author Credentials

Nathaniel Brassey Halhed (1751-1830) was an English Orientalist, philologist, and politician whose career embodied the scholarly dimension of early British imperialism. Born in Westminster and educated at Harrow School, where he befriended Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Halhed matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1768. At Oxford, his intellectual trajectory was decisively shaped by William Jones (1746-1794), the preeminent Orientalist scholar, under whose influence Halhed studied Arabic and developed a passion for Eastern languages.

Accepting a writership in the East India Company's Bengal service, Halhed became part of Warren Hastings's inner circle. Hastings commissioned him to translate the "Gentoo Code" (A Code of Gentoo Laws) from Persian, published in 1776, which established Halhed's reputation as a serious scholar of Indian languages and legal traditions. His credentials combined classical European education, patronage by the highest colonial authority, and direct engagement with Indian pandits and language teachers. Unlike later metropolitan scholars, he acquired linguistic knowledge through immersion in Bengal, working with native informants.

## East India Company Context

Halhed's grammar emerged during the East India Company's transformation from trading corporation to territorial power. Following the Battle of Plassey (1757) and acquisition of revenue collection rights in Bengal (1765), the Company faced unprecedented administrative challenges requiring systematic knowledge of local languages, laws, and customs. Warren Hastings championed ruling through indigenous institutions rather than wholesale anglicization, necessitating British administrators' acquisition of Indian languages and cultural knowledge.

The grammar was explicitly designed, in Halhed's words, as "a general médium of intercourse between the Government and its Subjects; between the Natives of Europe who are to rule, and the Inhabitants of India who are to obey." This frank articulation reveals the instrumental relationship between knowledge production and imperial governance. British administrators in Bengal's weaving districts needed to communicate with Bengali merchants controlling the textile trade central to Company profits, directly tying language acquisition to economic exploitation.

## Methodology

Halhed's methodological approach was pioneering yet constrained by eighteenth-century European linguistic frameworks. He worked directly with Bengali texts and native speakers, becoming "the first grammarian to write a Bangla grammar using Bangla texts and letters for illustration." The creation of Bengali movable type was a major achievement, involving collaboration with Charles Wilkins and Panchanan Karmakar, a Bengali blacksmith who created the typeface. This cross-cultural collaboration produced infrastructure that made Bengali printing possible with lasting consequences for Bengali literature.

However, Halhed imposed European linguistic categories onto Bengali, using Latin grammatical models as templates. This approach both revealed and obscured Bengali structures—making the language comprehensible to European learners while distorting features that did not fit classical categories. Halhed also made theoretical contributions to comparative philology, identifying relationships between Sanskrit, Persian, Arabic, Greek, and Latin—anticipating William Jones's 1786 Indo-European hypothesis by nearly a decade.

## Orientalist Scholarship

Halhed's grammar exemplifies early Orientalist scholarship in achievements and limitations. The work reflected the belief that understanding Asian languages was essential for effective colonial administration, positioning scholarship as a tool of governance. It participated in what Edward Said identified as Orientalism's fundamental operation: representing the Orient as an object of European knowledge and power. By codifying Bengali according to European models, Halhed rendered the language—and Bengali culture—legible, classifiable, and manageable within colonial frameworks.

Yet Halhed's Orientalism contained moments of genuine admiration for Indian achievements. His comparative philological insights suggested fundamental kinship between European and Indian civilizations, challenging racial hierarchies. His collaboration with William Jones placed him within the influential network of Company Orientalists who combined scholarly inquiry with imperial service. However, the grammar's dedication to Hastings and explicit articulation of colonial purposes reveal Orientalist scholarship's complicity with imperial power structures.

## Contemporary Reception

In its time, Halhed's grammar was received as groundbreaking. The technical feat of creating Bengali movable type and producing the first printed Bengali book generated considerable attention in India and Britain, demonstrating European mastery of Eastern languages and technological capacity for non-Roman scripts. Among Company officials, the grammar filled a pressing practical need for administration, commerce, and social interaction.

Bengali literati and pandits who collaborated likely had complex responses. Bengali print technology opened new possibilities for textual production and dissemination, potentially democratizing literature beyond manuscript culture. However, the grammar's framing of Bengali as an object of European study and explicit connection to colonial domination may have generated ambivalence. The work contributed to Warren Hastings's reputation as a patron of learning, providing ideological justification for Company rule during his impeachment trial (1788-1795).

## Later Critiques

Postcolonial scholarship has subjected Halhed's grammar to rigorous critique. Scholar Salimullah Khan critiqued it as "a product of European Orientalism and a reactionary attempt to introduce communalism," arguing Halhed and contemporaries "were propagating discord among Muslims and Hindus of Bengal." The grammar's explicit framing as a tool for domination exemplifies violence inherent in colonial knowledge production, where seemingly neutral grammatical description served hierarchical power relationships.

Critics identify the imposition of European grammatical categories as epistemic violence that distorted Bengali linguistic structures. By presuming Bengali needed to be "fixed" with "a grammar," colonial linguists assumed indigenous speakers lacked authoritative knowledge of their own language. The technological achievement of Bengali printing, while enabling broader circulation, also facilitated colonial surveillance, standardization, and control over literary production. The Hindi-Urdu division, partly shaped by colonial language policies including Halhed's work, continues to have political ramifications in South Asia.

## Value as Primary Source

Despite critiques, Halhed's grammar retains considerable scholarly value. For historical linguists, it provides evidence of late eighteenth-century Bengali usage, grammar, and lexicon. For historians of colonialism, it reveals intimate connections between linguistic knowledge and imperial governance, demonstrating how academic pursuits served colonial administration. For print history scholars, it marks the origin of Bengali printing, documenting technological processes and cross-cultural collaborations.

The work illuminates institutional structures of early Orientalism—patronage networks, educational formations, and collaborative practices producing colonial knowledge. As an artifact of Indo-European philology's emergence, it preserves comparative insights anticipating major developments in historical linguistics. For postcolonial studies, the grammar exemplifies textual practices through which colonialism operated, demonstrating how representation, classification, and codification functioned as techniques of power. Finally, it remains valuable for understanding the specific historical moment of the 1770s in Bengal—the consolidation of Company power and initial encounters between British Orientalist scholarship and Bengali intellectual traditions.
