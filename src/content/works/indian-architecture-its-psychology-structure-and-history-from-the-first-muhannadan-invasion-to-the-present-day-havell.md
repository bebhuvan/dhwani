# Indian Architecture: Its Psychology, Structure, and History from the First Muhammadan Invasion to the Present Day

## Overview

Published in 1913 by John Murray, London, this 260-page volume with 130 plates represented E.B. Havell's most comprehensive intervention into architectural historiography, directly challenging the evolutionary framework established by James Fergusson's *History of Indian and Eastern Architecture* (1876). Where Fergusson employed racial and evolutionary categories that positioned Indian architecture as derivative and inferior, Havell argued for indigenous aesthetic principles rooted in Vedic philosophy and vastu shastra, tracing continuous spiritual traditions from pre-Islamic India through the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal periods. The work's central thesis—that Indo-Islamic architecture represented a synthesis rather than foreign imposition, with Islamic builders absorbing Indian spatial concepts, decorative vocabularies, and symbolic systems—constituted a controversial nationalist reinterpretation that positioned India as the aesthetic donor rather than recipient.

Havell's methodology integrated architectural analysis with broader cultural theory, arguing that the "psychology" of Indian architecture derived from metaphysical rather than utilitarian imperatives. He contended that Buddhist and Hindu architectural principles—including mandala-based planning, cosmological symbolism, and the integration of sculpture with structural form—fundamentally shaped Islamic monuments in India. This perspective directly contradicted colonial scholarship that attributed Indo-Islamic architectural achievements to Persian and Central Asian sources, dismissing indigenous contributions as decorative embellishment. Havell specifically challenged Fergusson's "persistent habit of looking outside of India for the origins of Indian art," asserting that "all Saracenic symbolism in architecture" was borrowed from "India, Persia, Byzantium or Alexandria," thereby inverting established hierarchies of influence.

The volume's focus on medieval Islamic architecture examined major monuments of the Delhi Sultanate (1206-1526) and Mughal Empire (1526-1857), analyzing how indigenous builders adapted Islamic architectural forms while maintaining traditional structural and ornamental systems. Havell argued that features commonly attributed to Islamic innovation—including the bulbous dome, raised platforms, chattris (domed kiosks), and vegetative tracery—represented continuities with Buddhist and Hindu architectural traditions rather than foreign imports. This argument, extended to iconic structures like the Taj Mahal, proved especially contentious, with Havell claiming Buddhist temple precedents for its plan and decorative elements, though he later complicated this thesis by also proposing Italian architect Geronimo Veroneo as a possible designer based on 17th-century Portuguese accounts.

## About the Author — Ernest Binfield Havell

Ernest Binfield Havell (1861-1934) served as Principal of the Government School of Art, Calcutta (now Government College of Art & Craft) from 1896 to 1905, where he implemented curriculum reforms that rejected European academic traditions in favor of Indian artistic practices, particularly Mughal miniature painting. These reforms, developed in collaboration with artist Abanindranath Tagore, nephew of Rabindranath Tagore, catalyzed the Bengal School of Art, the first significant Indian nationalist art movement. Havell's tenure proved highly controversial; European students and some colonial administrators opposed his emphasis on traditional decorative arts and Indian philosophical aesthetics, accusing him of orientalism and impracticality. However, his collaboration with Abanindranath Tagore and later with Sri Lankan-British art historian Ananda Coomaraswamy established foundational concepts in Indian art historiography, particularly the notion that Indian art expressed spiritual rather than material concerns.

Born in Reading, Berkshire, Havell trained at the Royal College of Art and studied in Paris and Italy before serving as superintendent of the Madras School of Art (1884-1896). During his 1902-1903 sabbatical in England, he published influential articles in *The Studio* that introduced Indian art to British audiences beyond colonial administrative circles. After leaving Calcutta in 1908, he co-founded the India Society (1910) with William Rothenstein as a response to Sir George Birdwood's dismissive remarks about Indian art at a public lecture, where Birdwood had characterized Indian sculpture as inferior to European traditions. Havell's major publications included *Indian Sculpture and Painting* (1908), *The Ideals of Indian Art* (1911), *Indian Architecture* (1913), and *The Ancient and Medieval Architecture of India: A Study of Indo-Aryan Civilisation* (1915), producing approximately fifteen books on Indian art, history, and culture before his death in Oxford on December 31, 1934.

## The Work

**Scope and Methodology:**

The volume systematically examines Indo-Islamic architecture from the Ghurid invasions of the late 12th century through early 20th-century colonial Indo-Saracenic buildings, emphasizing continuity over rupture. Havell analyzed major monuments including the Qutb complex in Delhi, Tughlaq-era fortifications, provincial Sultanate architecture (Jaunpur, Bengal, Gujarat, the Deccan), and Mughal structures from Humayun's tomb through Shah Jahan's marble monuments. His analytical framework privileged symbolic interpretation over structural mechanics, arguing that architectural forms encoded philosophical and cosmological meanings derived from Vedic and Buddhist traditions. He particularly emphasized vastu shastra principles—ancient Indian architectural treatises prescribing proportional systems, directional orientations, and symbolic correspondences—as underlying frameworks that Islamic patrons and builders adapted rather than replaced.

Havell's critique of Western architectural prejudices extended beyond Fergusson to broader Victorian aesthetic hierarchies that privileged Greek and Gothic architecture while dismissing non-European traditions as stagnant or derivative. He argued that European scholars' materialism prevented comprehension of Indian architecture's spiritual dimensions, particularly the integration of architecture with sculpture, painting, and landscape in unified aesthetic programs. This holistic approach, which Havell linked to Arts and Crafts movement principles, positioned Indian architectural traditions as alternatives to industrial-era architectural specialization. His comparative methodology drew connections between Indian and Japanese art, Byzantine mosaics, and medieval European manuscript illumination, situating Indian aesthetics within trans-Asian and pre-Renaissance European networks rather than subordinating them to classical Greco-Roman canons.

The work's emphasis on "psychology" reflected contemporary European aesthetic theory, particularly German idealist philosophy and John Ruskin's moral aesthetics, which Havell adapted to argue that Indian architecture manifested collective spiritual consciousness rather than individual artistic genius. This approach, while challenging colonial evolutionary schemas, also essentialized Indian civilization as fundamentally spiritual and ahistorical, a problematic formulation that later postcolonial scholars critiqued as orientalist despite its anti-imperial intentions.

**Historical Context:**

*Indian Architecture* emerged during the height of the Swadeshi movement (1905-1911), which advocated economic and cultural self-reliance as resistance to British colonial rule following the 1905 partition of Bengal. Havell's reforms at Calcutta Art School directly supported Swadeshi cultural nationalism by rejecting European artistic models and promoting indigenous craft traditions threatened by industrial imports. The Bengal Renaissance—an intellectual and cultural efflorescence spanning roughly 1840-1940—provided broader context for Havell's interventions, as Bengali intellectuals including Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, Swami Vivekananda, and the Tagore family developed nationalist cultural theories that emphasized India's spiritual heritage as counterweight to material British power. Havell's collaboration with Abanindranath Tagore positioned the Bengal School as visual expression of this cultural nationalism, with its emphasis on Mughal-influenced wash techniques, mythological subjects, and anti-materialist aesthetics.

The publication coincided with intensifying debates over colonial art education policy, sparked by exhibitions of student work from Indian art schools that revealed thoroughgoing Europeanization of curricula. Havell's writings provided theoretical justification for reform, arguing that imposed European academic methods had destroyed living craft traditions while failing to produce artists capable of either European or Indian excellence. His position attracted support from British Arts and Crafts theorists including William Morris's followers, who saw parallels between industrialization's impact on English and Indian craftsmanship, while provoking fierce opposition from colonial administrators who viewed nationalist art movements as politically subversive. The India Society, which Havell co-founded in 1910, organized exhibitions and publications that introduced metropolitan British audiences to Indian artistic traditions, contributing to broader Edwardian primitivism that valued non-Western aesthetics as alternatives to academic conventions.

## Significance

**Contemporary Reception:**

The work provoked immediate controversy within colonial scholarly circles while garnering nationalist enthusiasm in India. European architectural historians dismissed Havell's claims of Indian origins for Indo-Islamic architectural elements as romanticism unsupported by structural evidence, particularly his arguments regarding the Taj Mahal's Buddhist antecedents. Vincent Smith, author of the standard *History of Fine Art in India and Ceylon* (1911), engaged in extended polemics with Havell over the nature of Indian aesthetics, with Smith defending Fergusson's evolutionary framework and criticizing Havell for ignoring Persian and Central Asian architectural precedents. However, Havell's work received support from emerging Indian scholars and cultural nationalists who embraced his challenge to colonial hierarchies, even when disputing specific claims. The book's emphasis on spiritual and philosophical dimensions of architecture resonated with Swadeshi-era efforts to articulate distinctively Indian modernity rooted in indigenous knowledge systems rather than wholesale Westernization.

**Later Assessment:**

Postcolonial art historians have identified Havell's work as foundational to Indian art historical discourse while critically examining its orientalist assumptions and nationalist overcorrections. Tapati Guha-Thakurta's *The Making of a New 'Indian' Art* (1992) and Partha Mitter's *Much Maligned Monsters* (1977) analyze how Havell and Coomaraswamy, despite challenging colonial racial hierarchies, constructed essentialized categories of "Indian spirituality" versus "Western materialism" that reinforced orientalist binaries while inverting their valuations. Subsequent scholarship has demonstrated that Indo-Islamic architecture involved complex negotiations between multiple traditions—including Persian, Central Asian, indigenous Indian, and local regional practices—rather than simple continuity or synthesis. Havell's emphasis on vastu shastra has been complicated by research showing limited evidence for systematic application of Sanskrit architectural treatises to Islamic monuments, though his broader argument for indigenous technical contributions has been substantiated.

The work's influence extended beyond art history to architectural practice, informing debates over appropriate styles for Indian public buildings during late colonial and early independence periods. Architects including Claude Batley drew on Havell's theories to justify Indo-Saracenic synthesis styles, while modernist practitioners like Le Corbusier engaged critically with claims about timeless Indian aesthetic principles. Contemporary heritage conservation in India continues to negotiate Havell's legacy, balancing recognition of indigenous architectural achievements against nationalist narratives that minimize historical ruptures and transcultural exchanges. Recent scholars have reappraised Havell's emphasis on symbolic and aesthetic analysis as valuable corrective to purely technological or political approaches to architectural history, even while rejecting his ahistorical spiritualism.

**Value for Researchers:**

The work remains essential primary source for studying early 20th-century nationalist historiography, revealing how anti-colonial intellectuals appropriated and inverted orientalist categories to construct alternative modernities. Havell's detailed architectural descriptions and the volume's 130 photographic plates provide valuable documentation of monuments' early 20th-century conditions, before subsequent restoration interventions and urban development. His translations and interpretations of Sanskrit aesthetic theory, while now superseded by specialist scholarship, illuminate how colonial-era intellectuals mobilized textual traditions for nationalist cultural politics. The volume's comparative methodology, linking Indian architecture to broader Asian, Islamic, and medieval European traditions, anticipated later art historical approaches emphasizing circulation and connectivity over isolated civilizational development.

For scholars of Indo-Islamic architecture specifically, Havell's work represents crucial moment in historiographic shift from externalist explanations emphasizing foreign influences to recognition of indigenous agency and aesthetic traditions, despite overcorrection toward continuity at expense of acknowledging genuine innovations and ruptures. His attention to symbolic meanings and philosophical contexts, though often speculative, established frameworks for interpreting architectural programs that subsequent scholars have refined through more rigorous historical and philological methods. The work's limitations—including inadequate attention to patronage contexts, construction technologies, economic factors, and regional variations—reflect broader early 20th-century art historical methodologies privileging stylistic and aesthetic analysis over social history approaches developed in later decades. Contemporary architectural historians engage Havell's interpretations as important historiographic layer shaping modern understandings of Indo-Islamic architecture, requiring critical examination alongside the monuments themselves.
