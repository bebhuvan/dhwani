description: "Patanjali's Mahabhashya stands as Sanskrit linguistics' most comprehensive and philosophically profound work, composed around 150 BCE as detailed commentary on Panini's Ashtadhyayi grammar sutras and Katyayana's critical annotations. This monumental text of approximately 250,000 words explores not merely grammatical rules but the philosophical foundations of language: the relationship between word and meaning, the nature of linguistic cognition, the ontological status of linguistic entities, and the purpose of grammatical study. Through dialogue format between teacher (acharya) and student (shishya), Patanjali examines each grammatical rule with exhaustive analysis, considers objections, provides justifications, and explores implications. The work established frameworks for Indian linguistic philosophy influencing all subsequent Sanskrit grammatical tradition, Mimamsa philosophy of language, and Buddhist-Hindu debates on linguistic reference. Beyond technical grammar, the Mahabhashya addresses universals versus particulars, permanence versus impermanence, and knowledge acquisition—making it essential text for Indian philosophy, not merely linguistics."
