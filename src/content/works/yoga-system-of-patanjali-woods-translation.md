# The Yoga-System of Patañjali: Or, The Ancient Hindu Doctrine of Concentration of Mind

## Overview

The Yoga-System of Patañjali, translated by James Haughton Woods in 1914, represents one of the most scholarly and comprehensive English presentations of classical yoga philosophy. This work encompasses Patañjali's foundational Yoga Sutras (written around 2nd century BCE to 2nd century CE), Vyāsa's authoritative commentary (Yoga-bhāṣya, c. 5th century CE), and Vācaspati Miśra's sophisticated sub-commentary (Tattvavaiśāradī, c. 9th century CE). Together, these texts form the complete classical tradition of yoga philosophy, presenting a systematic approach to spiritual development through the cultivation of concentration, ethical conduct, and ultimately, the realization of the true nature of consciousness.

## About the Authors and Commentators

### Patañjali (c. 2nd century BCE - 2nd century CE)
**Patañjali** is traditionally regarded as the compiler and systematizer of yoga philosophy, though the historical identity remains somewhat unclear. The Yoga Sutras attributed to him represent not a single person's innovation but the codification of ancient yoga practices and philosophical insights that had been transmitted through oral tradition for centuries. Patañjali's genius lay in organizing this vast body of practical and theoretical knowledge into a concise, systematic format of 196 sutras (aphorisms) that cover all aspects of yogic practice and theory.

### Vyāsa (c. 5th century CE)
**Vyāsa** (not to be confused with the legendary author of the Mahabharata) wrote the earliest and most authoritative commentary on the Yoga Sutras, known as the Yoga-bhāṣya. This commentary is so fundamental to understanding Patañjali's terse sutras that it is virtually impossible to comprehend the original text without it. Vyāsa expanded on Patañjali's concise statements, providing definitions, examples, and philosophical elaborations that made the abstract concepts accessible to students and practitioners.

### Vācaspati Miśra (c. 9th century CE)
**Vācaspati Miśra** was one of India's greatest philosophers, writing authoritative commentaries on multiple philosophical systems including Advaita Vedanta, Samkhya, and Yoga. His sub-commentary on Vyāsa's work, called Tattvavaiśāradī ("Discrimination of Principles"), represents the height of intellectual analysis of yoga philosophy. Vācaspati's contribution lies in his precise philosophical analysis, resolution of apparent contradictions, and integration of yoga philosophy with other Indian philosophical systems.

### James Haughton Woods (1864-1935)
**James Haughton Woods** was a distinguished American orientalist and professor of philosophy at Harvard University. His deep knowledge of Sanskrit, combined with his philosophical training and understanding of Indian thought, made him uniquely qualified to translate this complex work. Woods' translation is particularly valued for its scholarly accuracy, extensive footnotes, and philosophical sensitivity to the nuances of Sanskrit philosophical terminology.

## Historical and Philosophical Context

### The Development of Yoga Philosophy
The Yoga Sutras emerged from a long tradition of spiritual practice and philosophical inquiry:

- **Vedic Origins**: Early practices of concentration and meditation found in the Vedas
- **Upanishadic Development**: Systematic exploration of consciousness and liberation
- **Samkhya Influence**: Adoption of dualistic metaphysics distinguishing consciousness (puruṣa) from matter (prakṛti)
- **Buddhist Interaction**: Mutual influence with Buddhist meditation and philosophical traditions
- **Classical Systematization**: Patañjali's codification of diverse practices into a unified system

### Philosophical Framework
The Yoga system is built on several fundamental principles:

#### Dualistic Metaphysics
- **Puruṣa**: Pure consciousness, the true self, inactive and eternal
- **Prakṛti**: Primordial matter, the source of all phenomenal existence
- **Liberation (Kaivalya)**: The discrimination and separation of consciousness from matter

#### Eight-Limbed Path (Aṣṭāṅga Yoga)
1. **Yama**: Ethical restraints (non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, continence, non-possessiveness)
2. **Niyama**: Observances (cleanliness, contentment, austerity, study, devotion to God)
3. **Āsana**: Physical postures for meditation
4. **Prāṇāyāma**: Breath control and regulation
5. **Pratyāhāra**: Withdrawal of the senses from external objects
6. **Dhāraṇā**: Concentration on a single object
7. **Dhyāna**: Sustained meditation
8. **Samādhi**: Absorption and ultimate realization
