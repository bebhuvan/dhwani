# The Descent of the Sun: A Cycle of Birth

## Overview

Published in 1903 with elaborate scholarly apparatus suggesting translation from Sanskrit original, Francis William Bain's *The Descent of the Sun: A Cycle of Birth* exemplified a distinctive Edwardian literary phenomenon: Orientalist fantasy masquerading as authentic Oriental text. The 106-page romantic narrative, second in Bain's popular series, presented itself as translation of ancient Hindu manuscript—complete with translator's preface, extensive footnotes explaining "untranslatable" Sanskrit puns, and transliterated Sanskrit chapter headings lending scholarly authority.

Yet this scholarly performance masked creative fiction. Bain, Oxford-educated professor at Deccan College in Pune (1892-1919), composed these romantic tales himself, drawing on genuine familiarity with Indian settings and Hindu philosophical concepts gained during decades in India, but filtering them through Edwardian romantic sensibilities, Victorian morality, and Western spiritual seeking. The "translation" fiction enabled him to market exotic spiritual romance to Western audiences while claiming authentic Oriental wisdom's authority.

*The Descent of the Sun* narrated an elaborate karmic tale spanning multiple reincarnations, exploring fated love, divine intervention, spiritual evolution through suffering, and ultimate cosmic union. Hindu concepts—karma, reincarnation, *dharma*, *bhakti*—provided philosophical framework and exotic setting, yet the narrative's core remained thoroughly Western: romantic individualism, transcendent love conquering cosmic obstacles, and spiritual journey culminating in personal fulfillment rather than traditional Hindu liberation (*moksha*).

The work's commercial success demonstrated Edwardian appetite for Oriental mysticism and exotic romance. Yet it also exemplified Orientalism's problematic dynamics: Europeans claiming authority to represent Asian traditions, manufacturing "authentic" Eastern texts to satisfy Western fantasies, appropriating complex religious systems as decorative elements for romantic plots, and reducing living traditions to exotic resources for Western spiritual consumption.

Bain's pseudo-translations occupy an ambiguous position: dismissed as fraudulent by those seeking genuine translations, they nevertheless reveal significant cultural currents—Western spiritual seeking, colonial knowledge appropriation, and mechanisms through which "India" was constructed and consumed in Edwardian imagination.

## About F. W. Bain (1863-1940)

### Oxford Education and Indian Career

Born Francis William Bain on April 29, 1863, he received education embodying Victorian intellectual culture: Westminster School provided classical foundation; Christ Church, Oxford developed his abilities in ancient languages, history, and literature. His academic distinction—election as Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford (1889), one of Britain's most prestigious academic positions—positioned him for scholarly career in Britain.

Instead, Bain joined the Indian Educational Service in 1892, accepting professorship of History (later History and Economics) at Deccan College in Pune (Poona), Maharashtra—a government college training Indian students for administrative and professional careers. This career trajectory—Oxford don becoming colonial educator—typified how British imperial administration drew on academic institutions to staff educational positions in India.

Bain's nearly three-decade Indian residence (1892-1919) provided extensive exposure to Indian culture, languages, and society. Pune, as major Marathi cultural center with significant Brahmin intellectual community and rich Sanskrit scholarly tradition, offered ideal environment for someone interested in Indian culture. Unlike some British academics who maintained colonial distance, Bain engaged Indian intellectual and cultural life sufficiently to acquire genuine (if imperfect) understanding of Hindu philosophical concepts, Sanskrit literature's conventions, and Indian aesthetic sensibilities.

Yet his engagement remained fundamentally colonial—position of authority over Indian students, participation in imperial educational structures designed to produce anglicized Indian subordinates, and cultural knowledge acquired serving European scholarly and literary production rather than genuine intercultural dialogue.

### Literary Deception and the "Translation" Series

Bain's literary career began with *A Digit of the Moon* (1898), presented as translation of discovered Sanskrit manuscript—the eighth part of sixteen from text given by anonymous Brahmin. The preface described finding the manuscript, challenges of translation, and necessity of rendering untranslatable Sanskrit poetic devices into English approximations—scholarly apparatus lending authenticity.

Contemporary reviewers expressed skepticism. One noted these were "graceful fancies" but questioned claims of Hindu authenticity. As Bain produced more volumes—*Syrup of the Bees*, *Bubbles of the Foam*, *Essence of the Dusk*, *Ashes of a God*, *Mine of Faults*, *Heifer of the Dawn*, *The Descent of the Sun*, and others—the pattern became clear: these were original compositions, not translations.

Yet Bain maintained the fiction throughout his career, never publicly acknowledging authorship. This sustained deception served multiple purposes:

**Commercial Appeal**: "Authentic" Oriental texts possessed exotic allure and spiritual authority that original fiction by British author lacked—translation fiction enhanced marketability

**Literary Freedom**: Claiming translation excused departures from conventional European literary norms—exotic "Oriental" narrative structures, mystical content, elaborate poetic descriptions could be attributed to original's requirements

**Spiritual Authority**: Presenting works as ancient Hindu wisdom lent them religious-philosophical gravitas beyond romantic fiction, appealing to Western spiritual seekers

**Orientalist Fantasy**: The translation pretense enabled Bain to present his own Orientalist imaginings as authentic Eastern wisdom, manufacturing the exotic "India" Western audiences desired

### Scholarly Credentials and Amateur Sport

Bain's Oxford credentials and professorial position provided authority for his translation claims—who better to discover and translate Sanskrit manuscripts than classically educated professor resident in India? His genuine scholarly training in ancient languages and textual criticism made the deception more plausible, even as actual Sanskrit scholars might have recognized inauthenticity.

Interestingly, Bain's interests extended beyond academics and literature. He was accomplished amateur footballer, playing for Oxford University, Wanderers F.C., and Corinthian F.C.—elite amateur clubs. This athletic dimension humanizes the scholarly deceiver, revealing multifaceted personality beyond literary fraud.

Bain retired from India in 1919, living in Britain until his death on February 24, 1940. His pseudo-Sanskrit romance series remained in print and retained loyal readership who, as later scholars noted, "could care less" whether they were authentic translations or Orientalist fantasies—the exotic spiritual romance satisfied regardless of authenticity.

## Historical and Literary Context

### Edwardian Orientalism and Spiritual Seeking

Bain's pseudo-translations emerged from specific historical-cultural context:

**Orientalist Scholarship**: 19th-century European Oriental studies made Asian texts increasingly available—Sanskrit epics, Buddhist scriptures, Persian poetry—creating educated audiences familiar with Eastern literature yet hungry for more

**Theosophy and Esoteric Spirituality**: Theosophical Society (founded 1875) popularized Hindu and Buddhist concepts—karma, reincarnation, spiritual evolution—among Western seekers dissatisfied with Christianity and materialism. Bain's works provided fictional embodiment of theosophical ideas

**Romantic Exoticism**: Romanticism's fascination with distant, mysterious cultures found new outlet in Indian themes—ancient wisdom, mystical philosophy, exotic customs provided material for romantic fantasy

**Colonial Knowledge**: British rule in India produced extensive scholarship on Indian culture, making "India" increasingly available as literary and philosophical resource for European authors

**Literary Market**: Growing middle-class readership sought exotic, spiritually uplifting entertainment—Bain's works satisfied desire for both romantic narrative and spiritual depth

### Pseudo-Translation as Literary Genre

Bain's works exemplified pseudo-translation—original compositions presented as translations to gain authenticity, exoticism, or literary freedom. This technique had precedents:

**Ossian (1760s)**: James Macpherson's claimed translations of ancient Gaelic epics, actually his own compositions, caused sensation and influenced Romanticism despite controversy over authenticity

**Ancient Ballads (18th-19th centuries)**: Various authors invented "discovered" folk ballads and medieval manuscripts, combining antiquarian interests with creative freedom

**Oriental Forgeries**: European authors created fake Persian, Arabic, and Chinese texts, exploiting Oriental exoticism

Bain's innovation involved sustained series maintaining translation fiction across multiple volumes while incorporating genuine cultural knowledge from residence in India—not mere armchair Orientalism but informed fantasy by someone with direct Indian experience.

### Hindu Concepts in Western Romance

Bain's appropriation of Hindu philosophical concepts for romantic fiction demonstrated both cultural engagement and fundamental misunderstanding:

**Karma and Reincarnation**: These concepts provided plot mechanisms—characters' fates determined by past lives, obstacles explained through karmic debts, multiple incarnations enabling elaborate narratives. Yet Hindu karma's moral complexity and reincarnation's soteriological context (liberation from rebirth cycles as ultimate goal) became simplified into romantic determinism—fated lovers reuniting across lives

**Dharma**: Hindu concept of cosmic order, social duty, and righteous action became vague "destiny" or "cosmic law" serving plot rather than complex ethical framework

**Bhakti Devotion**: Hindu devotional traditions' passionate love for deity provided model for human romantic love—yet reducing theological devotion to human romance inverted traditional hierarchies

**Maya and Illusion**: Vedantic teaching about phenomenal world's illusory nature became atmospheric mysticism rather than rigorous philosophical position

**Liberation (Moksha)**: Hindu ultimate goal of liberation from rebirth cycles transformed into romantic union—inverting tradition where attachments bind to *samsara* (rebirth cycle)

This appropriation demonstrated Orientalist pattern: taking concepts from complex religious-philosophical tradition, stripping away theological and cultural context, and redeploying them as exotic decoration for fundamentally Western narratives and values.

## The Descent of the Sun: Themes and Narrative

### Plot Structure: Cycles of Rebirth and Karmic Destiny

*The Descent of the Sun* (subtitle: *A Cycle of Birth*, claimed Sanskrit: *Trivikramādhogāśrīḥ*) narrated tale across multiple incarnations, following souls bound by karmic ties through successive lives toward eventual reunion and spiritual fulfillment. The narrative structure—shifting between lifetimes, revealing past actions' consequences, building toward cosmic resolution—employed Hindu reincarnation concept as elaborate plot device enabling romantic obstacles, dramatic revelations, and ultimately transcendent love.

The story involved divine and human characters entangled in karmic drama: souls experiencing joy and suffering across incarnations, actions in one life determining circumstances in next, and gradual spiritual evolution through accumulated experiences. This structure appealed to Western audiences fascinated by reincarnation while maintaining familiar romantic narrative arc—obstacles overcome, love triumphant, destiny fulfilled.

### Romantic Mysticism and Theosophical Spirituality

The work blended romance with mystical spirituality reflecting Theosophical influences:

**Spiritual Evolution**: Characters evolving spiritually through suffering and experience—Theosophical teaching about soul's progressive development through incarnations

**Cosmic Justice**: Karma ensuring ultimate justice and meaning—comforting alternative to Christian divine judgment or secular meaninglessness

**Transcendent Love**: Romantic love as spiritual force transcending death and rebirth—Western romantic idealism given cosmic significance through Hindu concepts

**Divine Intervention**: Gods (particularly Vishnu, in solar mythology context) participating in human destiny—anthropomorphized deities serving plot convenience

**Mystical Union**: Ultimate resolution in spiritual/romantic union—collapsing distinction between human love and divine realization

This synthesis satisfied Western spiritual seeking: Eastern exoticism and ancient wisdom combined with familiar romantic values and individualist spirituality.

### Literary Style: Ornamental Prose and Pseudo-Scholarly Apparatus

Bain's prose style combined elements:

**Ornamental Description**: Elaborate, poetic descriptions of settings, emotions, and cosmic events—Victorian literary aestheticism merged with imagined Sanskrit poetic conventions

**Archaic Diction**: Slightly archaic English suggesting translation from ancient text—"thee/thou" constructions, inverted syntax, elevated vocabulary

**Footnotes**: Extensive notes explaining "untranslatable" Sanskrit puns, wordplay, and cultural references—lending scholarly authority while permitting authorial commentary

**Sanskrit Elements**: Transliterated Sanskrit words, phrases, and chapter titles—exotic linguistic texture even as actual Sanskrit knowledge remained superficial

**Philosophical Interludes**: Characters engaging in discussions about karma, dharma, cosmic order—Hindu concepts explained to Western readers

This style created effect of authenticity for readers lacking Sanskrit knowledge or deep Hindu philosophical understanding, while those with expertise recognized inauthenticity.

## Reception and Influence

### Commercial Success and Popular Appeal

Bain's series, including *The Descent of the Sun*, achieved significant commercial success:

**Loyal Readership**: Devoted followers who appreciated exotic spiritual romance regardless of authenticity questions

**Multiple Editions**: Works reprinted across decades, demonstrating sustained demand

**Cultural Influence**: The series influenced subsequent Western spiritual fiction blending Eastern philosophy with romantic narrative

**Gift Books**: Volumes published in attractive editions suitable as gifts, marketed as uplifting spiritual reading

This success demonstrated Edwardian appetite for spiritual-romantic literature offering exotic wisdom and transcendent love—entertainment combined with perceived depth.

### Critical Reception and Exposure

Contemporary and later critical reception proved mixed:

**Skeptical Reviews**: Early reviewers noting "graceful fancies" but questioning Hindu authenticity—recognizing literary quality while doubting translation claims

**Scholarly Dismissal**: Sanskrit scholars and Indologists recognizing inauthenticity, though many ignored popular fiction as beneath academic notice

**Eventual Exposure**: Gradual acknowledgment that works were original compositions, not translations—though Bain never publicly conceded

**Loyal Defenders**: Readers who valued works despite or because of fabrication, appreciating Bain's imaginative creation of "what Hindu romance should be" rather than authentic representation

**Postcolonial Critique**: Later scholars examining works as exemplifying Orientalist appropriation and colonial knowledge production

### Literary and Cultural Legacy

The series influenced several developments:

**Western Spiritual Fiction**: Helped establish genre of Western fiction incorporating Eastern spiritual concepts—forerunner to later New Age spiritual fiction

**Orientalist Romance**: Provided model for exotic romance blending Eastern settings with Western values—commercial formula persisting through 20th century

**Translation Ethics**: Raised questions about translation authenticity, cultural appropriation, and authorial honesty still relevant in postcolonial literary studies

**Popular Orientalism**: Demonstrated how "Orient" was constructed and consumed in Western popular culture—not through accurate representation but manufactured fantasy

## Critical Perspectives

### Orientalism and Cultural Appropriation

Edward Said's Orientalism framework illuminates Bain's problematic project:

**Manufacturing the Orient**: Bain created "Hindu" texts embodying what Western audiences imagined and desired Eastern spirituality to be—Orient as Western fantasy rather than cultural reality

**Authority Claims**: British professor claiming authority to represent Hindu tradition, positioning himself as mediator making authentic Eastern wisdom accessible to West

**Essentialization**: Reducing complex, diverse Hindu traditions to simplified, romanticized essence serving Western spiritual and aesthetic consumption

**Colonial Knowledge**: Cultural knowledge gained through colonial position (professor in colonial college) repackaged for Western commercial and cultural profit

**Erasure**: Manufacturing fake "authentic" texts potentially displaced or obscured actual Hindu literature and philosophy

Yet Bain's works also demonstrated Orientalism's complexity: genuine engagement with Indian culture alongside fantasy, real knowledge mixed with profound misunderstanding, appreciation combined with appropriation.

### Literary Fraud and Authorial Ethics

The translation deception raises ethical questions:

**Intentional Deception**: Sustained, deliberate fraud claiming translation of nonexistent originals—literary dishonesty for commercial gain and authorial authority

**Cultural Misrepresentation**: Presenting personal fantasies as representative of Hindu tradition—potentially shaping Western misunderstanding of Indian culture

**Scholarly Abuse**: Exploiting scholarly credentials and position to lend false authority to fictional constructions

**Reader Betrayal**: Deceiving readers seeking genuine Hindu wisdom into consuming Western fantasy

**Artistic Defense**: Could fraudulent means be justified by artistic achievement or readers' genuine appreciation?

Contemporary and postcolonial scholars generally condemn the deception while acknowledging the works' literary qualities and cultural-historical significance as artifacts revealing Western Oriental fantasies.

### Gender, Sexuality, and Colonial Fantasy

Bain's romantic narratives involved gendered and sexualized dimensions worth examining:

**Feminized Orient**: India portrayed with feminine characteristics—mysterious, passive, beautiful, exotic—available for Western masculine possession and interpretation

**Romantic Fantasy**: Elaborate romantic plots reflected Victorian/Edwardian anxieties and fantasies about sexuality, often displaced onto exotic settings allowing greater freedom than domestic fiction

**Colonial Desire**: Exotic romance potentially encoding colonial desire—Western domination of Eastern subject expressed through romantic/sexual metaphors

**Homosocial Subtexts**: Bain's bachelor status and sustained engagement with romantic fiction across career invite queer theoretical readings—exotic Eastern settings potentially enabling exploration of desires constrained in British contexts

These dimensions suggest Bain's works operated as fantasy spaces where various desires—spiritual, romantic, sexual, colonial—could be explored under cover of "translation" and exotic setting.

## Contemporary Relevance

### Historical Artifact of Orientalist Fantasy

Modern scholars approach Bain's pseudo-translations primarily as primary sources documenting Orientalist cultural production rather than literature of enduring artistic value. They reveal:

**Western Spiritual Seeking**: Edwardian-era alternatives to Christianity and materialism, showing how Eastern spirituality was appropriated for Western needs

**Cultural Appropriation Mechanisms**: How colonizers took cultural materials from colonized societies, transforming them to serve imperial culture

**Popular Orientalism**: Mass cultural consumption of "Orient"—not through accurate representation but manufactured fantasy satisfying Western desires

**Translation Politics**: Questions about authenticity, authority, and ethics in cross-cultural representation

### Literary Forgery and Authenticity Debates

Bain's case contributes to ongoing discussions:

**Pseudo-Translation Genre**: Understanding literary works claiming translation status, their motivations and effects

**Authenticity Value**: Why do readers and cultures value "authentic" over acknowledged fiction? What investments exist in authenticity?

**Cultural Authority**: Who can legitimately represent cultures? What credentials authorize cross-cultural representation?

**Artistic vs. Ethical Evaluation**: How to balance works' literary qualities against ethical problems in their production?

### Precedent for Contemporary Issues

Bain's pseudo-translations prefigure contemporary concerns:

**Cultural Appropriation**: Ongoing debates about who can use cultural materials from marginalized communities, under what conditions

**Spiritual Tourism**: Western consumption of Eastern spirituality, often decontextualized and commercialized

**Literary Hoaxes**: Various contemporary literary frauds claiming marginalized identities or manufactured texts

**Authentic Representation**: Demands for authentic, insider representation versus imaginative cross-cultural creation
