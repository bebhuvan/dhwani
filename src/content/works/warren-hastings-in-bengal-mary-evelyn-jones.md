# Warren Hastings in Bengal, 1772-1774

## Overview

Mary Evelyn Monckton Jones' 1918 study, published by Oxford's Clarendon Press, examines Warren Hastings' first years as Governor of Bengal (1772-1774), a formative period establishing administrative structures that shaped British rule in India for over a century. The 386-page work draws extensively on archival materials, with appendixes containing previously unpublished documents including correspondence, administrative orders, and financial records. Jones analyzes Hastings' efforts to regularize revenue collection, reform judicial administration, and establish British authority over Bengal's vast territories following the chaos after the Battle of Plassey (1757) and the devastating Bengal famine of 1770.

## Warren Hastings (1732-1818)

Warren Hastings served as Governor of Bengal (1772-1774) and first Governor-General of India (1774-1785), playing a central role in establishing British imperial administration in South Asia. After joining the East India Company in 1750, he rose through administrative ranks, gaining knowledge of Persian, Indian languages, and indigenous governance systems. Appointed Governor in 1772, he initiated reforms attempting to balance Company commercial interests with administrative stability. His later impeachment trial (1788-1795) for alleged corruption and misconduct, though ending in acquittal, generated extensive documentation of British Indian administration.

## The Critical Period: 1772-1774

These years marked the transition from East India Company rule focused primarily on trade extraction to territorial administration. The 1770 Bengal famine had killed an estimated 10 million people (one-third of Bengal's population), exposing the dysfunction of Company rule under previous governors. The British Parliament's Regulating Act of 1773 restructured Company governance, creating the position of Governor-General and imposing greater Crown oversight.

Hastings faced multiple crises: revenue shortfalls, administrative corruption, conflicts with Company directors in London, resistance from displaced Indian rulers, and the challenge of governing vast territories with minimal British personnel.

## Administrative Reforms

Jones documents Hastings' major initiatives:

**Revenue Administration:**
Hastings abolished the dual system (where the Company collected revenue through Indian intermediaries) and established direct British collection through district collectors. He attempted to fix revenue demands to prevent arbitrary assessment while ensuring steady Company income.

**Judicial Reforms:**
He created district courts (mofussil diwani adalats) for civil cases and criminal courts (faujdari adalats), attempting to apply Islamic and Hindu law as appropriate. This began the complex process of British authorities codifying and administering "traditional" Indian law systems.

**Commercial Policy:**
Hastings restricted private trade by Company servants that had contributed to corruption and conflict of interest. He attempted to rationalize commercial operations while maintaining profitable trade.

**Administrative Structure:**
He established councils, defined administrative divisions, and created bureaucratic procedures that became foundational for British Indian administration.

## Previously Unpublished Documents

Jones' appendixes contain archival materials including:
- Hastings' correspondence with Company directors
- Minutes of Bengal Council meetings
- Financial accounts and revenue records
- Judicial orders and administrative regulations
- Personal letters revealing policy deliberations

These primary sources provide evidence for understanding how British officials conceptualized their role, negotiated competing interests, and implemented policies that profoundly affected Bengali society.

## Scholarly Approach

Writing during World War I, Jones approached Hastings with scholarly objectivity rather than the partisan advocacy or condemnation that had characterized 19th-century treatments. She examined his administration within the context of institutional constraints, competing pressures, and available options, while acknowledging the exploitative foundations of Company rule. Her use of archival sources reflected early 20th-century professional historical methodology emphasizing primary document analysis.

## Historical Significance

This study contributed to reassessment of Hastings, who had been vilified in 19th-century British historiography emphasizing his impeachment. Jones' documentation of his administrative innovations influenced understanding of how British governance structures emerged in India and the challenges of establishing colonial authority over complex indigenous societies.

## Digital Preservation

This 386-page Oxford University Press work has been digitized and is freely accessible through the Internet Archive, providing scholars access to Jones' research and the unpublished archival documents in her appendixes documenting early British administrative development in Bengal.
