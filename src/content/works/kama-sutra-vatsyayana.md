description: "Vatsyayana's Kama Sutra stands as ancient India's comprehensive treatise on kama (sensual pleasure), one of Hinduism's four legitimate life goals alongside dharma (duty), artha (prosperity), and moksha (liberation). Composed in 3rd century CE, this work of seven books systematically addresses not merely sexual positions (its Western reputation) but holistic philosophy of pleasure, love, relationships, and aesthetic living. The text covers: general principles of pleasure and life goals (Book I), sexual union techniques (Book II), courting and marriage (Book III), wives' conduct (Book IV), other men's wives (Book V), courtesans (Book VI), and attraction arts (Book VII). Beyond technical instruction, Vatsyayana presents sophisticated urban sociology: describing cosmopolitan nagaraka (man-about-town) lifestyle, courtesans' economic and artistic roles, gender dynamics in aristocratic circles, and pleasure's philosophical legitimacy within dharmic framework. Richard Burton's 1883 translation introduced this text to Victorian England, scandalizing some while revealing Indian civilization's mature, non-puritanical approach to sexuality, where erotic pleasure received systematic philosophical and practical treatment comparable to ethics, politics, or economics."
