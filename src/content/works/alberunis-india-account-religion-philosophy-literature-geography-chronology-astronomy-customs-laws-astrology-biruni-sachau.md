# Alberuni's India: An Account of the Religion, Philosophy, Literature, Geography, Chronology, Astronomy, Customs, Laws and Astrology of India, about A.D. 1030

This extraordinary work represents one of the most comprehensive and objective studies of Indian civilization ever undertaken by a foreign observer. Al-Biruni's systematic examination of 11th-century India demonstrates remarkable scholarly objectivity and methodological sophistication that was revolutionary for its time, providing an invaluable primary source for understanding medieval Indian society across multiple dimensions of human knowledge and culture.

## About the Authors

**Al-Biruni** (973-1050 CE) was a Persian polymath during the Islamic Golden Age whose contributions to mathematics, astronomy, physics, and comparative studies established him as one of history's greatest scholars. His approach to studying Indian culture was unprecedented - he learned Sanskrit, translated important texts including the Yoga Sutras, and committed himself to understanding Indian society on its own terms. His linguistic abilities encompassed Khwarezmian, Persian, Arabic, Sanskrit, Greek, Hebrew, and Syriac, enabling him to engage directly with primary sources across multiple traditions.

**Eduard Sachau** (1845-1930) was a distinguished German orientalist whose scholarly translation made Al-Biruni's masterwork accessible to modern academic study. His careful rendering preserved the original's methodological rigor while making this foundational text available for comparative anthropology and historical research.

## Significance

This work established new standards for cross-cultural scholarship and early anthropological methodology. Al-Biruni's systematic coverage of Indian religion, philosophy, science, law, and social customs demonstrates how scholarly objectivity could transcend cultural boundaries to produce authentic understanding of foreign civilizations.

The work provides irreplaceable documentation of medieval Indian intellectual and cultural life, offering insights into Hindu philosophical systems, scientific knowledge, and social practices that continue to inform historical and comparative studies of civilization, religion, and cross-cultural understanding.

## Digital Access

This work is freely available through the Internet Archive and Open Library, ensuring continued access for scholars, students, and readers interested in medieval history, comparative religion, early anthropology, and the development of cross-cultural scholarly methodology.
