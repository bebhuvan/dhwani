description: "The Sukasaptati (Seventy Tales of the Parrot) exemplifies the frame-narrative tradition in Sanskrit story literature, featuring a clever parrot who entertains and instructs his mistress Prabhavati through nightly tales that simultaneously delay her adultery and impart moral wisdom. Composed around 11th-12th century CE, this collection employs the familiar Indian narrative device of stories-within-stories: each night when Prabhavati prepares to visit her lover during her merchant husband's absence, the parrot Vichakshanaka (Wise One) narrates a captivating tale thatå»¶ongs until dawn, preventing her transgression. The seventy stories range from romantic adventures to moral exempla, demonstrating wit, fidelity, consequences of desire, and dharmic conduct. The text influenced Persian literature through  14th-century translation as Tuti-nama (Book of the Parrot), which reached Mughal courts and inspired illustrated manuscripts. B. Hale Wortham's English translation introduced this entertaining collection to Western readers, revealing its narrative sophistication and moral complexity."
