description: "The Samkhya Karika represents ancient India's foundational text of dualistic metaphysics and enumeration philosophy, systematizing Samkhya darshana through 72 verses presenting reality's binary structure: purusha (consciousness) and prakriti (matter-energy), cosmic evolution's 25 principles (tattvas), bondage as false identification between consciousness and matter, and liberation through discriminative knowledge. Composed around 4th century CE by Ishvarakrishna, this concise masterwork synthesizes earlier Samkhya teachings into systematic exposition: prakriti's three gunas (sattva-rajas-tamas) drive manifestation through imbalance, evolution proceeds through determinate sequence (mahat-intellect, ahamkara-ego, mind, senses, subtle elements, gross elements), purusha remains transcendent witness experiencing yet unchanged by prakriti's transformations, liberation (kaivalya) achieves through recognizing consciousness-matter distinction. Beyond metaphysical schema, Samkhya presents sophisticated philosophy of causation, detailed psychology, and atheistic soteriology emphasizing knowledge over ritual or devotion. The work profoundly influenced Hindu philosophy, Yoga practice, Vedanta thought, and Buddhist psychology, while presenting distinctive non-theistic liberation path demonstrating ancient India's philosophical diversity."
