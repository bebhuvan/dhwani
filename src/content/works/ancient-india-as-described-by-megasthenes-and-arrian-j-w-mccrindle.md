description: "J.W. McCrindle's 1877 compilation reconstructs ancient Greek accounts of Mauryan India from fragments of Megasthenes' lost Indica (c. 300 BCE) preserved in later authors. These eyewitness observations of Chandragupta Maurya's court, Indian society, and natural history provide invaluable non-Indian perspectives on ancient India, supplemented by Arrian's account of Alexander's Indian campaigns and their aftermath."
