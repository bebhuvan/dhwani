  The Rāmāyan of Vālmīki, translated into English verse by Ralph Thomas Horatio Griffith in 1895, represents a pivotal scholarly engagement with one of the most foundational epic narratives of Indian literary and cultural heritage during the late British colonial period. Griffith's translation emerged during a critical moment of cross-cultural intellectual exchange, when British Orientalist scholars were systematically documenting and interpreting classical Indian texts. This English rendition of Vālmīki's Sanskrit epic provides a comprehensive rendering of the canonical narrative of Rāma, an incarnation of the divine Vishnu, whose life story embodies complex philosophical, ethical, and social ideals central to Hindu cultural consciousness. Griffith's meticulous verse translation captures the intricate narrative structure of the original, presenting the epic's seven books (kāṇḍas) that trace Rāma's journey from royal prince to exiled hero, his abduction of his wife Sītā, the subsequent war against the demon king Rāvaṇa, and his ultimate restoration to the throne of Ayodhyā. Beyond its literary merits, the translation served as a crucial scholarly bridge, enabling Western audiences to comprehend the nuanced moral philosophies, social structures, and religious symbolism embedded in the original Sanskrit text. The work exemplifies the scholarly approaches of late 19th-century Indological research, providing contemporary scholars with insights into both the original epic's cultural significance and the intellectual methodologies of colonial-era textual interpretation. Griffith's translation remains an important historical document in the broader discourse of comparative literature and cross-cultural textual transmission.

# The Rāmāyan of Vālmīki (Griffith verse trans.)

## Overview

Ralph T.H. Griffith's English verse translation of Valmiki's Ramayana represents the first complete rendering of this Sanskrit epic into English. Originally published serially in five volumes between 1870 and 1874 by E.J. Lazarus & Co. in Benares and Trubner & Co. in London, the work was later consolidated into a single volume edition in 1895. This translation marked a significant milestone in making the ancient Hindu epic accessible to Western readers during the height of British colonial engagement with Indian literature and culture.

Griffith rendered approximately 24,000 Sanskrit shlokas into English verse using rhymed couplets, a metrical choice intended to preserve the poetic qualities of Valmiki's original composition. The translation encompasses the first six kandas (books) in their entirety, while the seventh and final book, the Uttara Kanda, appears in abridged form. This selective approach reflects nineteenth-century scholarly debates about the authenticity of the final book, which most textual scholars considered a later interpolation to the original epic.

The 1895 consolidated edition comprises 576 pages with nine preliminary pages of introductory material, presenting the complete narrative arc of Rama's life from his youth in Ayodhya through his exile, the abduction of Sita, the war with Ravana, and his eventual return to kingship. The work was published without copyright restrictions and has since entered the public domain, ensuring its continued availability through modern digital archives.

## About the Translator — R.T.H. Griffith

Ralph Thomas Hotchkin Griffith (1826-1906) served as one of the most prolific translators of Sanskrit literature into English during the Victorian era. Born in Corsley, Wiltshire, on May 25, 1826, Griffith studied at Queen's College, Oxford, where he earned his BA degree. In November 1849, he was appointed Boden Professor of Sanskrit at Oxford, a position established to support missionary work and Christian conversion efforts in India through Sanskrit scholarship.

Griffith subsequently served as principal of Benares College in India, where he combined administrative responsibilities with sustained engagement in Sanskrit textual studies. Later in his career, he relocated to Kotagiri in the Nilgiri hills of Madras Province, dedicating his final years exclusively to translation work. He died on November 7, 1906, in Kotagiri, having completed an ambitious program of rendering major Sanskrit texts into English verse.

Beyond the Ramayana, Griffith's translation corpus includes the Hymns of the Rigveda (1889), based on Max Müller's Sanskrit edition and following interpretations by the fourteenth-century commentator Sayana; Hymns of the Samaveda (1893); Hymns of the Atharvaveda (1896); and The Texts of the White Yajurveda (1899). His preference for verse translation over prose distinguished his approach from many contemporaneous translators, reflecting his conviction that English metrical forms could better convey the aesthetic and ritual dimensions of Sanskrit poetry. His translations provided foundational English-language access to Vedic and epic literature, though subsequent scholarship has identified limitations in his interpretative framework and linguistic precision.

## About the Ramayana

The Ramayana, traditionally attributed to the sage-poet Valmiki, constitutes one of the two major Sanskrit epics of ancient India, alongside the Mahabharata. Scholarly consensus dates the composition of the epic's oldest surviving layers to approximately the fifth to fourth centuries BCE, with later textual accretions extending into the third century CE. The work as transmitted in manuscript traditions comprises approximately 24,000 couplets (shlokas) organized into seven kandas: Bala Kanda (Book of Youth), Ayodhya Kanda (Book of Ayodhya), Aranya Kanda (Book of the Forest), Kishkindha Kanda (Book of Kishkindha), Sundara Kanda (Book of Beauty), Yuddha Kanda (Book of War), and Uttara Kanda (Supplementary Book).

Critical scholarship has established that Books Two through Six represent the epic's oldest compositional stratum, with the Bala Kanda and particularly the Uttara Kanda recognized as later additions. The Uttara Kanda, which Griffith abridged in his translation, contains material that diverges thematically and stylistically from the core narrative, including the controversial episode of Rama's rejection of Sita following her rescue from Lanka. The central narrative traces Prince Rama's fourteen-year exile from Ayodhya, undertaken to honor his father Dasharatha's promise; the abduction of his wife Sita by the demon-king Ravana of Lanka; Rama's alliance with the vanara (monkey) king Sugriva and his general Hanuman; the military campaign against Lanka; Sita's rescue; and Rama's return to Ayodhya to assume the throne.

As the ādi-kāvya (first poem) of Sanskrit literature, the Ramayana established narrative and metrical conventions that influenced subsequent literary production across South and Southeast Asian traditions. The text exists in multiple recensions, with significant textual variations between the northern and southern manuscript traditions. Valmiki's composition employs the anushtubh meter (32-syllable quatrains) throughout most of the epic, though certain sections incorporate other meters for specific narrative effects. The work functions simultaneously as courtly epic, devotional literature, and dharmashastra, articulating normative models of kingship, familial duty, and righteous conduct that have profoundly shaped Hindu ethical thought.

## The Work

Griffith's translation methodology reflects Victorian literary aesthetics and the constraints of English prosody when rendering Sanskrit metrical forms. He employed rhymed couplets as his primary verse structure, a choice that imposed English accentual-syllabic patterns onto the quantitative meter of the Sanskrit original. This formal decision necessitated extensive paraphrase, condensation, and occasional expansion of Valmiki's verse to accommodate rhyme schemes and maintain metrical regularity in English. The translation exhibits characteristic Victorian poetic diction, including archaisms, syntactic inversions, and frequent use of possessive constructions that distinguish it from modern English prose translations.

The scholarly apparatus of Griffith's edition includes preliminary introductory material, though his annotations and explanatory notes are relatively sparse compared to later scholarly editions with comprehensive linguistic and cultural commentary. Griffith worked during a period when European Sanskrit scholarship was establishing philological methodologies and critical editions of major texts. His translation demonstrates awareness of earlier European renderings, particularly August von Schlegel's German translation (1829) and Gaspare Gorresio's Italian version (1850), which served as reference points for his own interpretive decisions.

Griffith's treatment of the Uttara Kanda through abridgment rather than complete translation reveals his editorial judgment about textual authenticity and narrative coherence. This decision aligned with scholarly opinions regarding the supplementary character of the seventh book, though it also reflects Victorian sensibilities about appropriate narrative resolution and moral exemplarity. The first six books receive full translation, preserving the complete narrative of Rama's exile, Sita's abduction, the war with Ravana, and the triumphant return to Ayodhya. Griffith's verse rendering prioritizes narrative flow and accessibility for English readers unfamiliar with Sanskrit literary conventions, sometimes at the expense of linguistic precision or preservation of the original's semantic density.

The translation's presentation aimed to establish the Ramayana as literature worthy of comparison with classical European epics. This comparative framework, common in nineteenth-century Orientalist scholarship, positioned Sanskrit texts within Western literary canons while simultaneously marking them as products of Eastern civilization. Griffith's verse format implicitly argued for the Ramayana's status as refined poetry rather than merely religious scripture or anthropological document, though his Victorian English idiom creates aesthetic distance from both the Sanskrit source and contemporary English usage.

## Historical Significance

Griffith's 1870-1874 translation provided the first complete English-language access to Valmiki's epic, preceding later prose translations such as those by Hari Prasad Shastri and subsequent scholarly editions with extensive critical apparatus. For English-speaking audiences in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Griffith's version functioned as the primary introduction to the Ramayana narrative, shaping Western literary and scholarly understanding of the epic before alternative translations became available. The work circulated among Victorian readers interested in comparative mythology, colonial administrators requiring cultural knowledge of Hindu traditions, and scholars developing the emerging academic field of Indology.

The translation embodies the methodological assumptions and ideological frameworks of Victorian Orientalist scholarship, which combined genuine philological interest in Sanskrit texts with colonial power dynamics and Christian missionary objectives. Griffith's position as Boden Professor of Sanskrit, an endowment explicitly created to support Christian conversion efforts, situated his translation work within institutional structures linking Sanskrit learning to religious and political agendas. Nevertheless, his commitment to verse translation and his completion of major Vedic and epic texts contributed substantially to expanding English-language access to Sanskrit literature.

Subsequent translations have superseded Griffith's work in scholarly usage, particularly prose translations prioritizing linguistic accuracy over metrical form and critical editions incorporating textual variants and comprehensive annotations. Modern readers often find Griffith's Victorian diction and rhymed couplets stylistically dated, though the translation retains historical importance as a document of nineteenth-century cross-cultural literary transmission. The work influenced popular Western conceptions of Hindu mythology and contributed to broader Victorian engagement with Asian literary traditions, even as it reflected the interpretive limitations and cultural assumptions of its historical moment.

Griffith's Ramayana translation also participated in nineteenth-century debates about translation theory, particularly questions of whether verse or prose better served translational fidelity and whether English metrical forms could adequately represent Sanskrit prosody. His choice of rhymed couplets represented one approach to these questions, distinct from literal prose translations emphasizing semantic precision. The accessibility of his English verse facilitated wider readership beyond specialist scholars, contributing to popular knowledge of the epic narrative while potentially obscuring aspects of the Sanskrit original's linguistic artistry and theological complexity.

## Digital Access

The translation is freely available through multiple digital repositories, ensuring continued accessibility for contemporary readers and researchers. Project Gutenberg provides the complete text in various electronic formats suitable for different reading platforms and devices. The Internet Archive hosts scanned copies of original print editions, preserving the material form and paratextual elements of nineteenth-century publications.
