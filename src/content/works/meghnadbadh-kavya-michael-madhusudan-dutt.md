description: "Michael Madhusudan Dutt's Meghnadbadh Kavya (1861) revolutionized Bengali literature by introducing blank verse (amitra akshara chhanda) and reimagining the Ramayana from Ravana's perspective, creating Bengali epic poetry's first modernist masterwork. This nine-canto poem narrates the final days of Lanka's defense against Rama's invasion, culminating in Ravana's son Meghnad's (Indrajit's) heroic deathâ€”portrayed not as demonic villain's deserved fate but as noble warrior's tragic sacrifice defending homeland against foreign aggression. Dutt's subversive reading transforms traditional epic: Ravana becomes dignified king defending sovereignty; Meghnad emerges as ideal warrior combining martial prowess with filial devotion; Sita's abduction receives justification through Ravana's sister Shurpanakha's mutilation; and Rama's forces appear as invaders employing subterfuge against honorable opponents. Beyond narrative innovation, the poem achieved formal revolution: abandoning traditional Bengali payar couplets for English-influenced blank verse, employing enjambment and varied caesuras, incorporating Homeric/Miltonic conventions (extended similes, divine councils, heroic speeches), and demonstrating Bengali's capacity for sustained epic narrative. This synthesis of Western form and Indian content established template for modern Bengali poetry, proving regional language literature could achieve European classical standards while asserting indigenous cultural dignity through alternative mythological interpretations challenging colonial-era assumptions about Hindu tradition's monolithic nature."
