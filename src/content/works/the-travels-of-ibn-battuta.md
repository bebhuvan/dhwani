# The Travels of Ibn Battuta

## Overview

The Rihla (Journey) of Ibn Battuta documents one of the most extensive travel accounts from the medieval period, covering nearly 75,000 miles across Africa, Asia, and Europe between 1325 and 1354. The sections on India are particularly detailed, describing Battuta's eight-year residence (1333-1341) in Delhi as a qadi (Islamic judge) under Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq, his observations of Indian cities, social customs, religious practices, and political upheavals. The account provides rare contemporary documentation of 14th-century India from an outsider's perspective, offering insights into Delhi Sultanate administration, Indian Ocean trade networks, and cultural exchanges between the Islamic world and South Asia.

## About Ibn Battuta

Ibn Battuta (1304-1368/69) was a Moroccan scholar and traveler whose journeys exceeded those of his near-contemporary Marco Polo in both distance and geographic range. Born in Tangier, he began his travels at age 21 with a hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, then continued traveling for nearly three decades. His observations combined scholarly learning, administrative experience, and keen ethnographic interest. Upon returning to Morocco, he dictated his experiences to the scholar Ibn Juzayy, producing the Rihla, which became a major source for understanding 14th-century Islamic civilization and its connections with other cultures.

## Ibn Battuta in India

Battuta arrived in India in 1333 and spent eight years primarily in Delhi under Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq, serving as qadi and receiving generous patronage. His account describes:
- The sultan's court procedures, administrative systems, and unpredictable temperament
- Indian social customs, marriage practices, and religious observances
- Architecture of Delhi, including the Qutb complex
- Sati (widow immolation), which he witnessed and described in detail
- Indian Ocean trade routes and port cities
- Interactions between Muslim rulers and Hindu populations

## Historical Value

The Rihla serves as a primary source for 14th-century Indian history, particularly the Delhi Sultanate under Muhammad bin Tughluq. Battuta's detailed observations complement court chronicles and provide external verification for events and practices described in indigenous sources. His accounts of Indian cities, trade goods, social customs, and political events offer perspectives unavailable in contemporary Indian historical writing. Scholars use the text to study Indo-Islamic cultural synthesis, economic networks, and the extent of Islamic legal practice in medieval India.

## This Translation

H.A.R. Gibb's English translation, begun in the 1950s and completed posthumously, represents the standard scholarly translation. Gibb's annotations provide historical context and identify persons, places, and practices mentioned in the text. The translation makes Battuta's observations accessible to readers unfamiliar with Arabic while preserving the narrative's distinctive voice and ethnographic detail.

## Textual History

Ibn Juzayy compiled the Rihla in 1355 based on Battuta's dictation and his own notes from other travel accounts. The text exists in multiple manuscript traditions, with variations in detail and organization. Modern editions reconcile these variants to produce reliable texts. The work remained relatively unknown in Europe until the 19th century when French and German translations introduced it to Western scholarship.

## Digital Preservation

Gibb's translation has been digitized and is freely accessible through the Internet Archive, ensuring continued scholarly access to this important medieval travel account and its documentation of 14th-century India.
