description: "The Chandogya Upanishad, among the oldest and most voluminous Upanishads, explores ultimate reality through the famous doctrine of 'Tat Tvam Asi' (That Thou Art), presenting foundational Vedantic teachings on Brahman, the nature of Self, cosmology, and meditation. Composed around 8th-7th century BCE, this text of eight prapathakas (chapters) presents profound philosophical insights through narratives and dialogues: Uddalaka Aruni's instruction to son Shvetaketu establishing the identity of individual self (Atman) with universal reality (Brahman), the meditation on Om as comprising all existence, the doctrine of Prana as life-force, and cosmological speculations on creation from Being (Sat). The text contains immortal passages: the honey doctrine explaining universal interconnection, Satyakama's truth-seeking journey rewarded despite uncertain birth, and progressive teachings leading seekers from ritual to meditation to knowledge. The work's pedagogical sophistication and philosophical depth established frameworks influencing all subsequent Vedanta, with Shankara's commentary making it central to Advaita philosophy while other Vedantic schools offered alternative interpretations."
