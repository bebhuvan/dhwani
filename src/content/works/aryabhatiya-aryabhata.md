description: "Aryabhata's Aryabhatiya stands as ancient India's most influential astronomical and mathematical treatise, composed in 499 CE when its author was merely 23 years old. This compact work of 121 verses across four chapters revolutionized Indian mathematics and astronomy: introducing the place-value decimal system with zero, providing accurate calculations of Ï€ (pi) and sine tables, explaining eclipses through shadow theory rather than mythology, proposing Earth's axial rotation, and developing sophisticated algebraic and trigonometric methods. The text's terse Sanskrit verse format (one idea per verse) packed maximum information into minimal space, requiring extensive commentaries for full comprehension. Aryabhata's influence extended beyond India through Arabic translations that transmitted Indian numerals and astronomical methods to medieval Europe, fundamentally shaping the development of modern mathematics and science."
