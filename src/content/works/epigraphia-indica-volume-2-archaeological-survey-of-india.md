# Epigraphia Indica, Volume 2

## Overview
Published in 1891, the second volume of *Epigraphia Indica* continues the Archaeological Survey of Indiaâ€™s flagship series that catalogued inscriptions discovered across the subcontinent. Edited with contributions by D. R. Bhandarkar, the volume presents Sanskrit and Prakrit texts alongside English translations, historical commentary, and palaeographic observations that help reconstruct dynastic chronologies and regional religious developments.

## Highlights
Entries range from Gupta-period copper plates to medieval temple inscriptions, each meticulously edited with references to site provenance and prior scholarship. The volume preserves scripts and language variants, offering insight into titulature, land grants, and ritual patronage that shaped polity formation in early historic and medieval India.

## Access Notes
The University of California Libraries copy on the Internet Archive provides searchable OCR, high-quality PDF facsimiles, and individual image files suitable for epigraphic study. Users can leverage the detailed table of contents and indices to locate inscriptions by region, ruler, or script form.
