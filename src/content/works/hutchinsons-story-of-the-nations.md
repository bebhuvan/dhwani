  Hutchinson's Story of the Nations (c. 1900) - Published during the late Victorian era of British imperial scholarship, this work emerged at a critical moment when European intellectuals were systematically documenting and categorizing global civilizations through a colonial academic lens. At the turn of the 20th century, when British imperial knowledge production was at its zenith, this comprehensive popular history covering ancient civilizations including the Egyptians, Chinese, India, Babylonians, Hittites, Assyrians, Phoenicians, Carthaginians, and other Asian nations represented a significant attempt to construct a global historical narrative from a predominantly European perspective. This educational work presents accessible accounts of world civilizations for general readers.
