# The Bṛhad-devatā: A Summary of the Deities and Myths of the Rigveda

## Overview

Published in 1904 as part of Harvard Oriental Series, Arthur Anthony Macdonell's critical edition and translation of the *Bṛhad-devatā* made accessible an important Vedic ancillary text cataloging the pantheon of gods invoked in Rigvedic hymns. The *Bṛhad-devatā* (literally "Great [Treatise on] Deities"), attributed to ancient sage Shaunaka, systematically identifies which deities receive worship in each of the Rigveda's 1,028 hymns, resolves ambiguous divine references, and preserves mythological narratives about Vedic gods that supplement the often cryptic hymnic allusions.

This text served practical function in Vedic ritual—priests needed to know precisely which god a hymn addressed to perform sacrifices correctly. But it also preserves early Hindu mythology, recording stories about Indra's demon-slaying, Agni's birth and characteristics, the Ashvins' miraculous deeds, and other divine exploits that later Puranic mythology would elaborate. Macdonell's edition provided Sanskrit text with extensive English translation and commentary, correlating Bṛhad-devatā's information with actual Rigvedic passages and explaining mythological references.

For Western scholars approaching Vedic studies, the Bṛhad-devatā offered systematic guide to Rigveda's complex pantheon—essential orientation for understanding archaic hymns whose mythological context was often obscure without traditional commentary.

## About the Bṛhad-devatā Text

**Attribution and Date**: Traditional scholarship attributes the text to Shaunaka, legendary Vedic sage associated with Atharvaveda tradition (circa 800-400 BCE). Modern scholars debate precise dating but generally place composition in late Vedic or early Sutra period (roughly 400-200 BCE), when systematizing Vedic knowledge into ancillary sciences (Vedāṅgas) intensified.

**Purpose and Function**: As Vedic ritual became increasingly complex, priests required precise identification of deities for correct ritual performance. The Bṛhad-devatā provided authoritative reference—each Rigvedic hymn's primary deity (devatā), secondary deities if multiple gods received invocation, and resolution of ambiguous cases where modern readers might disagree about hymn's addressee.

**Content and Structure**: The text proceeds through Rigveda's ten mandalas (books), identifying deities mandala by mandala, hymn by hymn. It includes mythological digressions explaining divine characteristics, family relationships among gods, and legendary exploits referenced in hymns. These narratives preserve early forms of myths that Puranic literature would later expand and transform.

**Verse Format**: Composed in anushtubh meter (standard Sanskrit verse), the Bṛhad-devatā employs compact, sometimes cryptic Sanskrit requiring scholarly commentary—hence value of Macdonell's explanatory edition.

## Macdonell's Editorial Achievement

**Critical Text**: Macdonell collated multiple Sanskrit manuscripts, noting textual variants and establishing critical edition based on best manuscript evidence. This philological rigor ensured reliable Sanskrit text for scholars.

**Translation**: His English translation balanced literal accuracy with readability, clarifying obscure passages through bracketed explanations while preserving text's structure and meaning.

**Commentary**: Extensive notes correlated Bṛhad-devatā's identifications with actual Rigvedic hymns, explained mythological allusions, compared variant traditions in other Vedic texts, and analyzed interpretive problems. This apparatus made text accessible to scholars unfamiliar with Vedic commentary traditions.

**Comparative Analysis**: Drawing on his mastery of Indo-European mythology, Macdonell compared Vedic deities to Greek, Roman, Iranian, and Germanic divine figures—Indra to Zeus/Jupiter, Dyaus Pitar to Zeus Pater/Jupiter, Mitra to Mithras, demonstrating Indo-European mythological continuities.

## Vedic Pantheon and Mythology

The Bṛhad-devatā systematically presents Rigveda's divine realm:

**Major Deities**: Indra (warrior god who slays Vritra dragon and releases waters), Agni (fire god, ritual mediator between humans and heaven), Soma (deified ritual drink conferring immortality), Varuna (cosmic order and moral law), Mitra (friendship and contracts), the Ashvins (divine twin horsemen), Ushas (dawn goddess), Surya (sun god), Vayu (wind), Rudra (fierce storm god, Shiva's precursor).

**Divine Categories**: Differentiation between devas (gods of light and order), asuras (powerful beings sometimes allied with, sometimes opposed to devas—later exclusively demonic), Adityas (sovereign gods descended from Aditi), Maruts (storm gods accompanying Indra), celestial, atmospheric, and terrestrial deities according to Vedic cosmological classification.

**Mythological Narratives**: Indra's battle with Vritra (cosmic struggle releasing life-giving waters), Agni's multiple births and hiding in waters/plants, Soma's theft from heaven, the Ashvins' rescue of maidens and restoration of sight/youth, creation myths involving Prajapati or cosmic sacrifice of Purusha.

**Hymnic Identification Problems**: Many Rigvedic hymns address multiple gods or use epithets applicable to several deities. The Bṛhad-devatā resolved these ambiguities through traditional interpretation, though modern scholars sometimes disagree with its identifications.

## Significance for Vedic Studies

**Ritual Context**: Understanding which deity receives worship in each hymn clarifies Vedic ritual practice. Priests selected hymns based on sacrifice type and deity being propitiated—agricultural rites for Indra bringing rain, soma sacrifices for immortality, fire offerings for Agni as divine messenger.

**Mythological Preservation**: The text preserves mythology that Rigvedic hymns only allude to. Without Bṛhad-devatā and later commentaries, many mythological references would remain obscure. It bridges archaic Vedic mythology and later Puranic elaborations, showing evolution of Hindu mythology.

**Interpretive Tradition**: The work represents early Sanskrit hermeneutics—how ancient scholars systematized and interpreted revealed texts. It demonstrates that Vedic interpretation was never simply literal but involved sophisticated exegetical traditions.

**Comparative Mythology**: For scholars studying Indo-European mythology and religion, the Bṛhad-devatā provides systematic presentation of Vedic pantheon enabling comparison with Greek, Roman, Germanic, Iranian, and Celtic mythologies—revealing shared Indo-European religious heritage.

## Macdonell's Contribution to Vedic Scholarship

This edition exemplified Macdonell's scholarly strengths—philological precision, mythological expertise, clear presentation, and synthesis of Western academic method with Indian traditional learning. His commentary drew on traditional Sanskrit commentaries (Sayana's medieval Rigveda commentary) while applying comparative Indo-European analysis.

For Western students approaching Vedic literature, Macdonell's work provided essential foundation. The Rigveda's archaic language, complex meter, obscure mythology, and cryptic allusions made it formidably difficult. The Bṛhad-devatā, with Macdonell's guidance, offered systematic orientation to Vedic pantheon and mythology.

## Legacy and Continuing Relevance

The edition remained standard scholarly reference through the 20th century. Subsequent Vedic scholars built on Macdonell's work while sometimes revising interpretations based on new manuscript evidence or alternative mythological analyses. The Harvard Oriental Series made it accessible to international scholarship.

For understanding early Hinduism's development, the Bṛhad-devatā documents transition from Vedic sacrifice-centered religion toward devotional theism. The systematic deity cataloging shows early Hinduism organizing its pantheon, establishing hierarchies and divine relationships that later theology would formalize.

Contemporary Vedic scholars recognize both the text's importance for understanding how ancient Indians interpreted Rigveda and Macdonell's edition as exemplar of early 20th-century philological Vedic scholarship—showing methods and assumptions that shaped Western Vedic studies.

## This Digital Edition

This Internet Archive preservation provides free access to foundational Vedic scholarship. For students of Hindu mythology, Vedic ritual, comparative Indo-European religion, or history of Vedic interpretation, Macdonell's edition offers detailed introduction to Rigvedic pantheon and systematic presentation of Vedic mythology that supplements direct study of Rigvedic hymns themselves.
