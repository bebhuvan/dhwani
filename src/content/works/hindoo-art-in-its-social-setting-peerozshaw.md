## Publication Context and Nationalist Scholarship

"Hindoo Art in its Social Setting" appeared in 1934 during a critical juncture in both Indian art historical scholarship and anticolonial nationalism, when recovering and reinterpreting indigenous cultural achievements served dual purposes: establishing intellectual legitimacy challenging colonial deprecation of Indian civilization and cultivating national consciousness supporting independence movements. The work emerged amid growing institutional infrastructure for Indian scholarship: universities including Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras offered training in humanities and social sciences, publishing houses like The National Literature Publishing Co. Ltd. disseminated research in English and vernacular languages, and scholarly societies facilitated intellectual exchange among Indian researchers. The 1930s witnessed intensified nationalist mobilization following the Salt March (1930), Civil Disobedience campaigns, and Round Table Conferences negotiating India's constitutional future, making cultural nationalism—recovering authentic indigenous traditions predating colonial distortions—essential complement to political organizing. Art history proved particularly suitable for nationalist purposes: demonstrating sophisticated aesthetic achievements comparable to European traditions, revealing philosophical depth and spiritual values contrasting with Western materialism, and providing visual symbols of civilizational continuity connecting contemporary independence struggles to glorious precolonial past. Radhakrishnan's foreword lent philosophical gravitas and institutional prestige: as Vice Chancellor of Andhra University (1931-1936) and internationally recognized philosopher, his endorsement positioned Peerozshaw's dissertation within broader intellectual project articulating Indian civilization's distinctiveness and excellence. The choice of publisher, printer, and illustrator reflected indigenization: National Literature Publishing Co. promoted Indian authors, Basel Mission Press in Mangalore provided technical infrastructure, and Ruby J. Treasuryvala's illustrations avoided dependence on European artistic reproduction, creating entirely Indian-produced scholarly work even while using English language and Western dissertation format for international accessibility and academic legitimacy.

## Analytical Framework: Art and Social Structure

Peerozshaw's central interpretive move positioned artistic production as integral to comprehensive social order rather than autonomous aesthetic domain, arguing that ancient Indian art emerged from and reinforced civilization's distinctive values, institutions, and worldviews. This sociological approach examined how artistic forms reflected hierarchical social organization including varna (caste) system, with different artistic specializations assigned to specific castes, architectural programs embodying cosmological principles ordering society, and patronage networks connecting royal courts, merchant guilds, and religious institutions. The work analyzed temples as microcosms of universe and society: architectural layout mapping sacred geography, sculptural programs depicting divine hierarchies paralleling earthly social order, and ritual spaces differentiating access based on caste and gender distinctions. This framework demonstrated art's ideological functions legitimating existing power relations, though Peerozshaw's nationalist orientation emphasized cultural achievement rather than critical analysis of oppression, potentially romanticizing social structures that marginalized lower castes and women. His treatment of artistic guilds (shrenis) examined how hereditary craft specialization transmitted technical knowledge and aesthetic conventions across generations, ensuring stylistic continuity and quality standards while restricting innovation to prescribed parameters defined by canonical texts (Shilpa Shastras) and patron preferences. The dissertation explored relationships between religious institutions and artistic production: Buddhist monasteries and Hindu temples as major patrons commissioning sculpture, painting, and architecture; pilgrimage circuits creating demand for religious art and disseminating styles across regions; and sectarian competition driving aesthetic innovation as Shaivite, Vaishnavite, and Jain communities commissioned increasingly elaborate artistic programs. Peerozshaw analyzed economic dimensions including patronage sources (royal courts, merchant donations, temple endowments), materials and techniques determining stylistic possibilities, and trade networks facilitating artistic exchange with Southeast Asian, Central Asian, and Middle Eastern cultures. His framework anticipated later social art history examining production conditions, economic structures, and power relations, though remaining within cultural nationalist paradigm emphasizing civilizational achievements rather than critical deconstruction of categories and assumptions.

## Religious and Philosophical Dimensions

The dissertation devoted substantial attention to art's religious functions and philosophical foundations, examining how visual forms made abstract metaphysical concepts accessible and facilitated spiritual practices including meditation, devotion, and ritual worship. Peerozshaw analyzed Hindu iconography's symbolic systems: mudras (hand gestures) conveying specific meanings, attributes (weapons, lotuses, vehicles) identifying deities and communicating theological principles, and compositional formats (trinity groupings, cosmic dance poses) embodying philosophical doctrines. He examined Buddhist artistic evolution from aniconic representation respecting prohibition against depicting Buddha to anthropomorphic imagery under Mahayana influence, tracing how artistic conventions negotiated between doctrinal proscriptions and devotional needs. Jain art received attention for its distinctive aesthetic emphasizing austerity, geometric precision, and elaborate ornamentation within prescribed iconographic limitations, reflecting Jain philosophy's emphasis on non-violence, asceticism, and meticulous attention to karmic consequences. The work explored temple architecture as three-dimensional theology: mandala ground plans mapping cosmic order, vertical progression from material to spiritual realms, and sculptural programs narrating mythological episodes communicating ethical teachings. Peerozshaw discussed aesthetic theory articulated in Sanskrit texts including Vishnudharmottara Purana's sections on painting and sculpture, analyzing concepts of rasa (aesthetic emotion), bhava (emotional state), and dhvani (suggestion) demonstrating sophisticated philosophical engagement with artistic experience. He positioned artistic creation as spiritual discipline requiring ritual purification, meditation on divine forms, and adherence to canonical prescriptions, making artists ritual specialists rather than merely skilled craftspeople. This emphasis on spiritual dimensions served nationalist purposes—demonstrating civilization's depth and sophistication—while potentially minimizing aesthetic appreciation independent of religious function and obscuring secular artistic production including courtly entertainment, erotic art, and folk traditions.

## Architectural Analysis: Temples as Cosmological Diagrams

Peerozshaw's treatment of temple architecture demonstrated how built environments embodied metaphysical principles, social hierarchies, and ritual requirements, functioning simultaneously as cosmic diagrams, theological texts, and liturgical spaces. He analyzed regional variations in temple typology: Dravidian style's pyramidal vimanas and gopurams characteristic of South India, Nagara style's curvilinear shikharas dominant in North India, and Vesara style's hybrid forms in Deccan regions, examining how geographical, climatic, and cultural factors shaped architectural evolution. The dissertation explored temple complexes as microcosmic representations of universe: mandala-based ground plans orienting structures to cardinal directions and aligning with astronomical phenomena, concentric enclosures progressing from profane to sacred spaces, and vertical elevation from earth through intermediate realms to divine summit symbolizing spiritual ascent. Sculptural programs integrated architecture into comprehensive theological vision: exterior walls depicting worldly life, celestial pleasures, and dharmic duties; intermediate zones showing mythological narratives and divine manifestations; and innermost sanctum housing austere deity images for ritual worship. Peerozshaw examined technical achievements including corbeled vaulting enabling large interior spaces without true arches, sophisticated stone carving creating intricate decorative surfaces, and hydraulic engineering providing ritual bathing facilities and gardens. His analysis positioned temples as total artworks synthesizing architecture, sculpture, painting, and decorative arts into unified aesthetic-spiritual experience, though acknowledging regional diversity and sectarian variations preventing simple generalizations about "Indian temple." The work addressed debates about foreign influences particularly Greek impact following Alexander's invasion, arguing for indigenous origins of major architectural forms while acknowledging selective adoption of decorative motifs and construction techniques through cultural exchange. This balanced position navigated nationalist desire to claim autonomous Indian tradition and scholarly recognition of cross-cultural artistic transmission shaping all civilizations.

## Sculpture and Iconography: Visual Theology

The dissertation's extensive treatment of sculpture examined how three-dimensional forms communicated theological concepts, narrated mythological episodes, and facilitated devotional practices, analyzing both free-standing images and architectural relief sculpture. Peerozshaw explored iconographic conventions prescribed by canonical texts including Shilpa Shastras specifying proportions, attributes, poses, and gestures for deity representations, demonstrating systematic codification ensuring recognizability across regions and periods. He analyzed specific iconographic types: Shiva as cosmic dancer (Nataraja) embodying creation-preservation-destruction cycles, multi-armed goddesses displaying weapons and blessing gestures representing divine power's multifaceted nature, and narrative relief panels depicting episodes from Ramayana, Mahabharata, and Puranic literature communicating ethical teachings through visual storytelling. The work examined sculptural materials and techniques: stone carving's regional variations based on available geology, bronze casting's lost-wax process enabling intricate details and multiple reproduction, and stucco molding's flexibility for decorative elaboration. Peerozshaw discussed aesthetic qualities including idealization rather than naturalistic portraiture, emphasis on spiritual essence over individual personality, and rhythmic composition creating visual harmony. He explored sculpture's ritual functions: consecrated temple images believed to embody divine presence requiring daily worship, processional bronzes carried during festivals demonstrating deity's accessibility, and domestic shrines providing focus for individual devotion. The analysis positioned sculpture as visual theology making abstract philosophical concepts concrete: Shiva's third eye representing spiritual insight, Vishnu's conch symbolizing cosmic sound creating universe, and intricate yantric patterns manifesting metaphysical principles geometrically. This emphasis on religious symbolism privileged orthodox Brahminical interpretations potentially marginalizing folk deities, regional variations, and heterodox traditions, reflecting both author's scholarly training in canonical Sanskrit texts and nationalist desire to present unified civilizational achievement.

## Legacy and Contemporary Reassessment

Peerozshaw's dissertation contributed to establishing Indian art history as legitimate scholarly field, providing comprehensive survey demonstrating sophisticated aesthetic achievements and philosophical depth that countered colonial deprecation of Indian culture. The work influenced subsequent scholarship by modeling integration of formal analysis, iconographic interpretation, historical contextualization, and social-cultural framework, establishing methodological standards for studying Indian artistic traditions. Its publication through Indian institutions with Indian collaborators demonstrated infrastructure supporting indigenous scholarship independent of colonial academic apparatus, though necessarily using European languages and methodological frameworks for international legitimacy. The dissertation's nationalist orientation—emphasizing civilizational achievement, spiritual values, and cultural continuity—shaped postcolonial art history's interpretive frameworks while generating critical responses examining limitations in essentializing diverse traditions, privileging elite Brahminical culture, and romanticizing social hierarchies. Contemporary reassessments recognize both pioneering contributions and problematic assumptions: valuable documentation and analysis of artistic traditions alongside uncritical acceptance of caste system and gender restrictions, sophisticated iconographic interpretation alongside emphasis on religious dimensions potentially minimizing aesthetic appreciation and secular functions, and nationalist pride recovering indigenous achievements alongside homogenizing diversity into unified "Indian art." Current scholarship examines dimensions Peerozshaw's framework marginalized: subaltern artistic production including tribal and folk traditions, women's contributions as artists and patrons, economic and political contexts shaping artistic patronage, and colonial constructions of "Indian art" as category serving imperial ideologies. His work nevertheless remains significant for demonstrating early twentieth-century nationalist intellectuals' efforts to reclaim cultural heritage and articulate indigenous aesthetic theories independent of Western validation, contributing to intellectual decolonization even while necessarily engaging European scholarly frameworks and categories.
