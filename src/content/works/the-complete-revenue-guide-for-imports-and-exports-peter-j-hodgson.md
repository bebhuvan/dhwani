## Historical Context

Peter J. Hodgson's comprehensive handbook represents a pivotal archival document chronicling the intricate commercial and administrative mechanisms of the British East India Company during the early 19th century, a transformative period characterized by imperial economic expansion and systematic colonial trade regulation. Published in 1809, the work offers an unprecedented detailed compendium of maritime trade protocols, customs duties, and legal frameworks governing British and Irish port interactions with colonial trading networks, with particular emphasis on East India Company commercial operations. The handbook emerges during a critical historical moment when Britain was consolidating its global economic infrastructure, meticulously documenting complex trade procedures that underpinned imperial commercial strategies. Reflecting the administrative precision characteristic of British colonial governance, Hodgson's work provides scholars and historians with granular insights into the economic architectures that facilitated metropolitan-colonial economic exchanges. While primarily a technical administrative text, the handbook illuminates the sophisticated bureaucratic apparatus that enabled Britain's commercial dominance, capturing the intricate legal and economic mechanisms that shaped global trade relationships during the early 19th century. For Indian economic and cultural historians, the document serves as a crucial primary source revealing the administrative logics of colonial economic governance, offering nuanced perspectives on how imperial trading systems were conceptualized, regulated, and implemented. The work's meticulous cataloging of import-export regulations, customs schedules, and maritime legal procedures provides researchers with a rare, contemporaneous window into the complex transactional infrastructures that defined Britain's global commercial empire during a period of significant imperial transformation.

# The complete revenue guide for imports and exports

## Why this matters

During the Napoleonic Wars, the British state depended on customs revenue while merchants demanded clarity about shifting tariffs. Hodgson, a veteran revenue officer in Dublin, assembled this manual so shipmasters, brokers, and officials could consult a single source for current duties—especially the complex regulations covering East India Company cargoes and private trade imports.

## What's inside

The guide opens with instructions for entering and clearing vessels, followed by specimen forms for manifests, drawback claims, and warehouse bonds. Hodgson prints tables of duties on spirits, tobacco, wines, textiles, and “Asiatic goods imported by the East India Company,” distinguishing between Company monopoly goods and licensed private trade. Additional sections explain bonding procedures, quarantine rules, salvage laws, and conversions between foreign weights and British measures—vital for ships sailing from Calcutta or Bombay to Liverpool or Dublin.

## Historical setting

Printed in 1809, the manual captures tariff policy just before the 1813 Charter renewal ended the Company’s monopoly on Indian trade. Parliament was also debating how to integrate Irish customs after the 1801 Union. Hodgson’s book reflects administrators’ concerns about smuggling, wartime shortages, and the need for uniform enforcement across British and Irish ports.

## Research notes

Because Hodgson reproduces tables verbatim from Treasury circulars, the volume serves as a snapshot of early nineteenth-century customs law. Economic historians can extract duty rates on tea, indigo, saltpetre, and cotton; legal scholars can trace procedures for bonded warehouses and seizures. The extensive index helps locate specific commodities, while appendices cite statutes for further reference.

## Access

The Internet Archive scan offers high-quality images and an OCR layer that handles most tabular data. Downloadable PDF and text files make it straightforward to copy tariff tables into modern spreadsheets or to compare changes introduced by the 1813 and 1819 customs reforms.
