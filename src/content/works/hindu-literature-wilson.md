# Hindu Literature: Comprising The Book of Good Counsels, Nala and Damayanti, The Ramayana, and Sakoontala

## Overview

Published in 1900, Epiphanius Wilson's *Hindu Literature* anthology exemplified turn-of-century efforts to make world literary canons accessible to educated American middle-class audiences. The collection gathered four Sanskrit literary masterpieces in existing English translations: *The Book of Good Counsels* (Hitopadesa fables) translated by Edwin Arnold; *Nala and Damayanti* (Mahabharata episode) and *Sakoontala* (Kalidasa's drama) both translated by Monier Monier-Williams; and *The Ramayana* in Ralph T.H. Griffith's abridged version.

Wilson's editorial contribution involved selection, arrangement, and minimal framing—brief introductions, explanatory footnotes, and glossaries—making specialist translations comprehensible to non-specialist readers. This curatorial role determined which texts represented "Hindu Literature" for Western audiences and framed how Sanskrit literary traditions were understood in American cultural contexts.

The anthology participated in several cultural movements: the "Great Books" educational philosophy, Orientalist scholarly production making Asian literatures available in Western languages, and American cultural aspirations toward cosmopolitan sophistication. Wilson compiled dozens of similar anthologies—Chinese, Japanese, Egyptian, Arabian, Moorish literature—as part of Colonial Press's world literature series.

Yet this democratizing project involved problematic dynamics: decontextualizing texts from living religious and cultural traditions to serve Western secular literary education, imposing evolutionary cultural hierarchies appreciating "ancient wisdom" while implicitly positioning modern Western civilization as superior, and reducing complex religious systems to aesthetic objects for cultured consumption.

The anthology's contents revealed a particular construction of "Hindu Literature" emphasizing moral didacticism (fables), romantic heroism (epics), and aesthetic achievement (drama)—categories resonating with Western literary values while marginalizing other Sanskrit genres like philosophical texts, devotional poetry, or technical treatises. This selection shaped American cultural understanding of Indian literature for generations.

## About Epiphanius Wilson (1845-1916)

### English Origins and American Career

Born in 1845 in West Derby, Liverpool, England, Epiphanius Wilson pursued education preparing him for Anglican ministry. After ordination as Episcopal priest, he served as missionary to Labrador and Newfoundland—remote, harsh postings typical for young clergy without wealthy connections or family livings. His missionary experience, while brief, provided early exposure to cultural difference and translation challenges inherent in cross-cultural religious work.

Wilson's career trajectory shifted toward education and scholarship: he became professor of classics at Queen's College, Windsor, Nova Scotia, teaching Latin and Greek to Canadian students, then served as rector of St. Mark's Church in Mount Kisco, New York. This combination—classical education, theological training, pastoral experience—equipped him well for literary compilation work requiring familiarity with ancient texts, linguistic facility, and ability to mediate between specialist scholarship and general audiences.

His most sustained work involved literary journalism and editing: he served as literary editor for *The Churchman* (Episcopal periodical) for many years, then as foreign editor for *The Literary Digest* (1904-1914), translating extracts from Spanish, Italian, French, and German newspapers. This journalistic work developed skills crucial for anthology compilation: identifying significant texts, evaluating translations, condensing materials for accessible presentation, and understanding reader interests and capabilities.

### Prolific Anthology Compiler for Colonial Press

Wilson's major cultural contribution involved his extensive anthology work for The Colonial Press, particularly around 1900-1902. He compiled dozens of world literature volumes including:

**Oriental Literature Series**:
- *Sacred Books of the East* (Vedic hymns, Zend-Avesta, Dhammapada, Upanishads, Koran, Buddha's life)
- *Hindu Literature* (Hitopadesa, Nala-Damayanti, Ramayana, Shakuntala)
- *Chinese Literature* (Confucian Analects, Shi Jing, Mencius, Chinese poetry, travel narratives)
- *Japanese Literature* (classical poetry, tales, historical narratives)
- *Arabian Literature* (pre-Islamic poetry, Koran selections, Arabian Nights excerpts)
- *Moorish Literature* (Berber tales, Kabyle stories, North African folklore)

**Ancient Civilizations**:
- *Egyptian Literature* (hymns, tales, litanies, Book of the Dead, cuneiform writings)
- *Babylonian and Assyrian Literature* (epics, religious texts, historical records)

**European Traditions**:
- Various compilations of European classical and medieval literature

This prodigious output—often multiple volumes annually—demonstrated both Wilson's editorial efficiency and Colonial Press's commercial ambitions to dominate the world literature anthology market.

Wilson died on May 16, 1916, in Armour Villa Park, Yonkers, New York, having spent his final decades as cultural mediator bringing global literary heritage to American middle-class readers—a role combining genuine educational service with inevitable cultural distortions inherent in such massive compilation projects.

### The Cultural Mediator's Role and Limitations

Wilson occupied distinctive position in cultural production:

**Translator vs. Compiler**: Unlike scholarly translators (Arnold, Monier-Williams, Griffith) who engaged original Sanskrit texts through years of philological study, Wilson compiled existing translations, requiring linguistic breadth across multiple languages but not deep specialist expertise in any

**Scholar vs. Popularizer**: His classical education and clerical training provided scholarly credibility, yet his primary audience was general readers seeking accessible overviews rather than specialists requiring rigorous annotation

**Educator vs. Merchant**: His compilations served genuine educational purposes—making world literature available to those lacking access to university libraries or specialist publications—yet operated within commercial publishing demanding profitable sales

**Authority vs. Ignorance**: He claimed cultural authority to represent global literary traditions, yet his knowledge remained necessarily superficial across the dozens of traditions he compiled—informed generalist rather than expert

This position enabled cultural diffusion while risking distortion: texts decontextualized from specialist scholarly frameworks and living traditions, selections reflecting compiler's assumptions rather than indigenous literary values, and inevitable simplifications reducing complex traditions to digestible excerpts.

## Hindu Literature Anthology: Contents and Context

### The Book of Good Counsels (Hitopadesa)

The anthology opened with Edwin Arnold's translation of the *Hitopadesa* (Book of Good Counsels)—Sanskrit didactic fable collection composed by Narayana around 12th century CE, itself drawing on earlier *Panchatantra* tradition. The work comprised animal fables embedded in frame narrative: a king enlists Brahmin sage to educate his wayward sons through instructive stories featuring animals—jackals, crows, monkeys, lions—whose cunning, loyalty, betrayal, and wisdom illustrated political and ethical principles.

Arnold's Victorian translation rendered Sanskrit verse and prose into elegant English, preserving the nested narrative structure while adapting the style for 19th-century literary tastes. His version emphasized moral instruction—shrewd statecraft, prudent friendship, cautious speech, strategic action—resonating with Victorian values of practical wisdom and self-improvement.

Wilson's selection of Hitopadesa as opening work established particular frame for "Hindu Literature": beginning with didactic content accessible to Western audiences through familiar animal fable genre (Aesop, La Fontaine), emphasizing practical wisdom over religious mysticism, and demonstrating Sanskrit literature's applicability to universal human concerns. This opening suggested Hindu tradition's value lay partly in timeless moral instruction relevant across cultures.

### Nala and Damayanti (Mahabharata Episode)

The second work—Monier Monier-Williams's translation of *Nala and Damayanti* from the Mahabharata's *Vana Parva* (Forest Book)—shifted to romantic epic narrative. This beloved episode tells of King Nala's love for Princess Damayanti, their marriage through *svayamvara* (self-choice ceremony where bride selects groom), Nala's subsequent downfall through gambling addiction and demon possession, separation and suffering, and eventual reunion through Damayanti's faithfulness and divine intervention.

Monier-Williams, Oxford's first Boden Professor of Sanskrit and author of the standard Sanskrit-English dictionary, provided scholarly yet readable translation preserving the episode's emotional intensity, philosophical interludes on fate and free will, and elaborate poetic descriptions. The narrative combined romantic idealism (transcendent love surviving catastrophic trials) with Hindu theological elements (karma, dharma, divine intervention, demon possession).

Wilson's inclusion emphasized Sanskrit literature's sophisticated romantic narrative comparable to Western epic traditions (Homer, Virgil) and medieval romance, challenging stereotypes about Indian literature as exclusively mystical or otherworldly. The focus on human emotions—love, jealousy, despair, hope—demonstrated Sanskrit literature's psychological depth and universal appeal.

### The Ramayana

Ralph T.H. Griffith's abridged Ramayana translation provided the anthology's centerpiece—the monumental epic of Prince Rama's exile, wife Sita's abduction by demon king Ravana, war to rescue her, and ultimate triumph of dharma (righteousness) over adharma (unrighteousness). Griffith, another distinguished Victorian Sanskritist, had produced complete metrical English translation of the Ramayana, from which Wilson selected representative episodes.

The Ramayana's inclusion demonstrated several dimensions:

**Religious Epic**: Unlike secular fables or romantic tales, the Ramayana functions as Hindu sacred text—Rama as Vishnu's avatar, the narrative encoding theological and ethical teachings central to Hindu devotional traditions

**Cultural Centrality**: Ramayana's pervasive influence across South and Southeast Asian cultures, its status as defining text shaping Hindu cultural imagination

**Heroic Narrative**: Epic battles, loyal friendships, noble sacrifices, and ultimate good's triumph over evil—universal epic themes in specifically Hindu expression

**Moral Exemplar**: Rama as ideal king, Sita as ideal wife, Hanuman as ideal devotee, Lakshmana as ideal brother—characters embodying dharmic virtues

Wilson's selection and framing balanced appreciating Ramayana's religious significance with presenting it as literary achievement comparable to Western epics—navigating between respect for Hindu sacred tradition and secular literary appreciation.

### Sakoontala (Shakuntala)

The anthology concluded with Kalidasa's *Shakuntala*—classical Sanskrit drama considered among world theater's masterpieces. Monier-Williams's translation presented the romantic tragedy of Shakuntala (forest-dwelling hermit's daughter) and King Dushyanta (royal suitor): their forest meeting and love, curse causing Dushyanta to forget her, Shakuntala's suffering bearing his child unrecognized, eventual recovery of memory through ring, and joyful reunion.

Kalidasa (traditionally dated 4th-5th century CE, though dating remains contested) represented Sanskrit literature's classical zenith—poetic sophistication, dramatic skill, and aesthetic refinement that early European Orientalists compared to Shakespeare. His works profoundly influenced European Romantic poets (Goethe famously praised Shakuntala) and established Sanskrit drama's reputation for literary excellence.

*Shakuntala*'s inclusion served multiple purposes:

**Dramatic Achievement**: Demonstrating Sanskrit literature encompassed sophisticated theater, not just narrative or didactic genres

**Romantic Sensibility**: The play's emotional delicacy, nature imagery, and focus on love's triumph resonated with Victorian literary sensibilities

**Poetic Language**: Kalidasa's ornate poetic style showcased Sanskrit's aesthetic capabilities

**Cultural Refinement**: Classical drama suggested ancient Indian civilization's cultural sophistication rivaling any classical tradition

Wilson's anthology conclusion with Shakuntala left readers with impression of Hindu literature's aesthetic peak—refined, beautiful, emotionally resonant drama comparable to greatest world theatrical traditions.

## Editorial Apparatus and Framing

### Introductions and Contextual Information

Wilson provided brief introductions to each work, offering historical context, author information (when known), literary significance, and guidance for appreciation. These introductions balanced scholarly information with accessible prose, avoiding specialist jargon while conveying essential background.

The introductory apparatus performed ideological work beyond mere information:

**Canonization**: Wilson's selection and presentation constructed particular "Hindu Literature" canon, privileging certain works and genres over others

**Evolutionary Framework**: Implicit suggestions of literary development from didactic simplicity (fables) through epic grandeur (Mahabharata, Ramayana) to classical refinement (Shakuntala)—narrative echoing Western literary history from Homer through medieval romance to Shakespeare

**Universal Humanism**: Emphasis on universal themes—love, duty, wisdom, heroism—transcending cultural specificity, appealing to Western readers while potentially obscuring distinctively Hindu philosophical and religious dimensions

**Civilizational Comparison**: Frequent comparisons to Western classics (Greek drama, Roman epic, European romance) validated Hindu literature's significance while subtly maintaining Western literary tradition as standard of comparison

### Glossaries and Annotations

Wilson included glossaries defining Sanskrit terms, cultural concepts, mythological references, and religious ideas—essential apparatus for readers lacking background in Hindu culture. These glossaries mediated between specialist Orientalist knowledge and general reader comprehension.

The annotation choices revealed cultural hierarchies and assumptions:

**Religious vs. Cultural**: Some distinctively Hindu religious concepts (karma, dharma, moksha) explained as philosophical ideas accessible to secular Western readers—desacralizing religious content for literary appreciation

**Exotic Detail**: Emphasis on picturesque cultural particulars—marriage customs, ascetic practices, courtly rituals—satisfying Western curiosity about exotic "Orient"

**Moral Universalism**: Highlighting ethical teachings recognizable across cultures while potentially downplaying culture-specific values or controversial practices (caste, gender norms)

## Reception and Influence

### Commercial Success and Educational Impact

Colonial Press's world literature series, including Wilson's *Hindu Literature*, achieved significant commercial success. The volumes' affordability, attractive presentation, and comprehensive scope made them accessible to middle-class Americans seeking cultural education. They found places in:

**Public Libraries**: Establishing world literature sections making global classics available to general borrowers

**School Curricula**: Some selections used in progressive education promoting cultural literacy and cosmopolitan perspective

**Home Libraries**: Middle-class households displaying world literature volumes as markers of cultural sophistication

**Gift Books**: Attractive editions serving as respectable, improving gifts

This circulation patterns democratized access to world literature, enabling readers outside universities and wealthy metropolitan centers to engage texts previously confined to specialist libraries.

### Educational Philosophy: Great Books and Cultural Literacy

The anthology participated in "Great Books" educational movement—the conviction that reading canonical texts from diverse civilizations developed cultural literacy, refined aesthetic judgment, cultivated moral wisdom, and prepared individuals for democratic citizenship. This philosophy, influential in American progressive education, assumed:

**Universal Values**: Great texts across cultures address shared human concerns, enabling cross-cultural understanding

**Literary Canon**: Identifying and preserving masterworks provides stable cultural heritage amid modernity's changes

**Democratic Education**: Making classics accessible to all, not just elite scholars, furthers democratic ideals

**Character Formation**: Literature cultivates moral and aesthetic sensibilities essential for good citizenship

Wilson's anthologies embodied these ideals, though also their limitations and blindspots—particularly regarding whose values counted as "universal," which works achieved "canonical" status, and how cultural hierarchies operated even within apparently egalitarian educational projects.

### Orientalist Knowledge Dissemination

The anthology channeled Victorian Orientalist scholarship—Arnold's, Griffith's, and Monier-Williams's translations—to broader publics. This dissemination had complex effects:

**Positive Impacts**:
- Increased American familiarity with Indian culture and literature
- Challenged crude stereotypes through exposure to sophisticated literary achievement
- Enabled comparative literature study and intercultural appreciation
- Validated non-Western literary traditions' significance

**Problematic Dimensions**:
- Decontextualized texts from living Hindu religious and cultural contexts
- Imposed Western literary categories and values onto Sanskrit traditions
- Constructed essentialized "Hindu Literature" obscuring diversity and change
- Positioned Indian culture as ancient, static past rather than dynamic, contemporary civilization
- Served cultural consumption satisfying Western curiosity without requiring genuine engagement with Indian perspectives

## Critical Perspectives

### Postcolonial Critique: Cultural Appropriation and Decontextualization

Edward Said's Orientalism framework and subsequent postcolonial literary studies illuminate Wilson's anthology's problematic dimensions:

**Selective Representation**: Wilson's four-work selection constructed particular "Hindu Literature" emphasizing aspects resonating with Western values—moral didacticism, romantic heroism, aesthetic refinement—while marginalizing other significant genres (philosophical texts, devotional poetry, tantric literature, technical treatises)

**Decontextualization**: Extracting texts from living religious and cultural contexts to serve Western secular literary education transformed their meanings and functions—sacred texts becoming aesthetic objects, religious epics becoming adventure narratives, philosophical teachings becoming exotic wisdom

**Cultural Ownership**: European/American claiming authority to select, interpret, and represent Hindu literary traditions—colonial knowledge production where colonizers determined how colonized cultures were understood

**Temporal Displacement**: Presenting Hindu literature as ancient past—"classics" appreciated like Greek and Roman antiquity—rather than engaging contemporary Indian literary production or recognizing Sanskrit's continuing cultural vitality

**Consumption Logic**: Reducing complex religious and philosophical traditions to cultural commodities for Western consumption—literature as exotic import satisfying cosmopolitan tastes

Yet the anthology also enabled genuine cross-cultural appreciation, inspired some readers toward deeper engagement with Indian culture, and demonstrated non-Western traditions' intellectual sophistication to audiences who might otherwise remain ignorant.

### Canon Formation and Literary Hierarchy

The anthology's construction of "Hindu Literature" canon reveals power dynamics in literary valuation:

**What Was Included**: Fables, romantic epic, religious epic, classical drama—genres with Western parallels, enabling comparative appreciation while potentially marginalizing distinctively Indian literary forms

**What Was Excluded**: Philosophical sutras, Puranic mythology (beyond epic), devotional bhakti poetry, regional language literatures, contemporary Indian writing, texts addressing caste or controversial religious practices

**Criteria of Selection**: Literary merit assessed through Western aesthetic standards (coherent narrative, character development, poetic beauty), accessibility to Western readers, and cultural "representative" status—all reflecting compiler's cultural position

**Hierarchies Imposed**: Implicit evolutionary narrative from simple (fables) to sophisticated (drama) echoing Western literary history; comparison to Western classics (Aesop, Homer, Shakespeare) simultaneously validating and subordinating

**Authority Claimed**: European-American literary editor claiming expertise to represent entire Hindu literary tradition—colonial presumption despite compiler's limited specialist knowledge

### Translation Politics and Mediation

The anthology's reliance on Victorian translations involved particular interpretive choices:

**Victorian Aesthetic**: Arnold's, Griffith's, and Monier-Williams's translations employed Victorian poetic conventions, elevated diction, and Romantic sensibilities—making Sanskrit literature "beautiful" to Victorian tastes while potentially distorting original aesthetic qualities

**Religious Neutralization**: Translations often secularized religious content, presenting theological concepts as philosophical ideas or poetic imagery—making texts acceptable to secular Western readers while effacing Hindu religious meanings

**Moral Sanitization**: Potentially controversial elements (caste hierarchies, gender norms, violence) sometimes muted or explained apologetically—protecting Western sensibilities while misrepresenting textual content

**Cultural Assumptions**: Translators' own Orientalist assumptions, Christian theological backgrounds, and imperial ideologies inevitably shaped interpretive choices

Wilson's compilation reproduced these Victorian translation choices without critical examination, naturalizing particular Orientalist readings as authoritative representations.

## Contemporary Relevance

### Historical Document of Cultural Mediation

Modern scholars approach Wilson's anthology primarily as primary source documenting turn-of-century cultural processes:

**Orientalist Knowledge Circulation**: How Victorian Orientalist scholarship reached broader Western publics through commercial publishing

**Canon Formation**: Mechanisms constructing literary canons across cultural boundaries—selections, exclusions, hierarchies, frameworks

**Cultural Consumption**: How non-Western cultures were packaged and marketed for Western audiences—commodification of cultural difference

**Educational Philosophy**: "Great Books" ideals, cultural literacy movements, and cosmopolitan educational aspirations

**Publishing History**: Commercial strategies making world literature profitable market segment

### Gateway Text Despite Limitations

Despite problematic aspects, anthologies like Wilson's historically served as gateways:

**Initial Exposure**: For many Western readers, first encounter with Sanskrit literature, potentially inspiring deeper engagement

**Accessible Introduction**: Providing overview before specialized study, orientation to major works and genres

**Comparative Framework**: Enabling recognition of literary sophistication across cultures, challenging ethnocentric dismissals

**Foundation for Critique**: Later scholars and readers could critique these representations precisely because they had access through such compilations

### Continuing Anthology Challenges

Wilson's work raises perennial questions about anthologizing across cultures:

**Selection Authority**: Who has legitimacy to represent cultural traditions? What qualifications authorize cross-cultural curation?

**Audience Adaptation**: How to make culturally specific materials accessible without distortion? Balance between accessibility and authenticity?

**Contextual Needs**: What apparatus (introductions, notes, glossaries) enables understanding without imposing interpretive frameworks?

**Living Traditions**: How to present texts from continuing religious and cultural traditions without reducing them to historical artifacts or aesthetic objects?

**Power Dynamics**: How do economic, political, and cultural power differences affect cross-cultural literary mediation?
