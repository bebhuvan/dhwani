# A Glossary of the Tribes and Castes of the Punjab and North-West Frontier Province

## Project Origins and Institutional Context

A Glossary of the Tribes and Castes of the Punjab and North-West Frontier Province originated within British India's census operations and ethnographic survey initiatives of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The foundation rested on two comprehensive census reports: Sir Denzil Ibbetson's 1883 Punjab Census Report, which included extensive ethnographic appendices, and Sir Edward Maclagan's 1892 census, which expanded documentary coverage of regional groups. Horace Arthur Rose, appointed Superintendent of Ethnography for Punjab (1901-1906) following his role in the 1901 census, undertook compilation of these materials into a systematic reference work organized alphabetically rather than by census district or administrative division.

The project formed part of broader Ethnographic Survey of India efforts initiated in 1901 under Herbert Hope Risley's direction. Provincial surveys aimed to document India's social diversity through standardized methodologies combining census enumeration with anthropometric measurements, genealogical investigations, and recording of customs and traditions. Rose's compilation represented Punjab's contribution to this empire-wide documentation project, though his emphasis remained descriptive rather than theoretical, avoiding racial classification schemes prominent in some contemporary ethnographic work.

Government of Punjab printing presses in Lahore published Volume I in 1911, Volume II in 1919, and Volume III in 1919, with the complete three-volume set priced at 22 shillings. The work gained official status as the authoritative reference on Punjab social organization, used by district administrators, revenue officials, and judicial officers navigating customary law and communal relations.

## Structure and Coverage

The three volumes totaled approximately 1,800 pages organized alphabetically by group name. Volume I covered A through "Indus," Volume II addressed J through "Koli," and Volume III completed Kom through Z with appendices. Entries varied in length from brief notes on small localized groups to extensive articles spanning multiple pages for major communities like Jats, Rajputs, or Brahmins. Each entry typically addressed: group distribution across Punjab districts; occupational specializations; clan or sub-caste divisions; marriage customs and kinship patterns; religious affiliations and sectarian variations; traditional narratives of origins; and relationships with neighboring groups.

Coverage extended across ethnic and religious categories. Entries documented Hindu caste groups ranging from Brahmins and Kshatriyas through artisan jatis and untouchable communities; Muslim groups including Sayyids, Sheikhs, various tribal communities, and occupational groups; Sikh jats and other Sikh castes; tribal populations of hill districts; and small minorities including Christians, Parsis, and Jews. The glossary also addressed occupational communities (weavers, potters, metalworkers), religious specialists (faqirs, yogis, mendicants), and peripatetic groups.

Geographical scope encompassed Punjab Province (including areas now in Pakistan's Punjab and Indian Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh) and the North-West Frontier Province (modern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa). Special attention addressed frontier tribal groups (Pathans, various Afghan tribes) and hill populations of Kangra, Simla, and other Himalayan districts where ethnic diversity and social organization differed substantially from plains regions.

## Methodology and Sources

Rose's methodology combined census enumeration data with information from settlement reports, district gazetteers, customary law compilations, and correspondence with district officers possessing local knowledge. Settlement reports prepared during land revenue surveys contained extensive notes on village social composition, customary land tenure, and local traditions. District officers contributed specialized knowledge of groups within their jurisdictions, documenting oral histories, clan genealogies, and local variations in customs.

The work reproduced substantial portions of Ibbetson's and Maclagan's census ethnographic appendices, incorporating their classification systems and analytical observations while adding new material from post-1892 sources. Rose consulted published ethnographic literature including Tod's Annals of Rajasthan, Crooke's Tribes and Castes of the North-Western Provinces, and specialized studies of particular communities. Sanskrit and Persian textual references appeared where relevant to claims of status or origin, though Rose adopted skeptical stance toward traditional narratives claiming Rajput or foreign ancestry for communities whose occupations and social position suggested indigenous origins.

The compilation's descriptive emphasis reflected Rose's stated methodology: collecting facts in fullest possible detail without formulating comprehensive theories regarding racial composition, tribal evolution, or caste origins. This approach distinguished the Glossary from contemporary works emphasizing racial classification or evolutionary frameworks for caste development. Rose documented diversity and variation rather than imposing unified explanatory schemes, acknowledging complexity and regional differences in social organization.

## Customary Law and Social Regulation

Substantial entries addressed customary law governing marriage, inheritance, adoption, and property rights among different communities. Punjab's legal system recognized customary law for agricultural castes and tribes, granting it authority exceeding personal laws derived from religious texts in rural property matters. District officers compiled "riwaj-i-am" (customary law) records during settlement operations, documenting practices regarding land inheritance, widow remarriage, bride-price, and other socially regulated behaviors.

The Glossary integrated this legal material, documenting variations in marriage patterns: groups practicing hypergamy (marrying daughters into superior clans) versus those observing endogamy within clan units; levirate and widow remarriage permissions; cross-cousin marriage patterns; bride-price versus dowry customs. Inheritance rules received attention: patrilineal versus matrilineal systems; primogeniture versus equal division; women's inheritance rights; adopted sons' status. These details bore practical legal significance in district courts adjudicating property disputes and family matters under customary law jurisdiction.

Entries documented social regulations governing commensality, interdining restrictions, pollution concepts, and occupational exclusions maintaining caste boundaries. The Glossary recorded details of got (exogamous clan) systems among Jats and Rajputs, prohibiting marriage within patrilineal clan while permitting wider intercaste alliance patterns. Such documentation served administrative needs in mediating intercommunal disputes and verifying claims of status affecting legal rights and social privileges.

## Religious and Sectarian Diversity

Religious diversity received extensive treatment. Hindu entries addressed sectarian affiliations (Vaishnavite, Shaivite, Shakta), temple pilgrimage traditions, and festival observances. Muslim entries documented Sunni-Shia divisions, Sufi order affiliations (Chishti, Qadiri, Naqshbandi, Suhrawardi), shrine complexes and saint veneration, and syncretic practices blending Islamic and local traditions. Sikh communities received attention regarding doctrinal orthodoxy versus popular practices incorporating caste distinctions despite egalitarian Sikh teachings.

Tribal religious traditions, particularly in frontier and hill regions, appeared prominently. Entries documented non-Brahmanical Hindu practices, local deity worship, shamanic traditions, animal sacrifice customs, and festival cycles independent of Sanskritic Hindu frameworks. Muslim tribal groups exhibited practices including saint veneration, shrine offerings, and seasonal festivals that district ethnographers distinguished from "orthodox" Islamic observance.

The Glossary documented religious specialists and mendicant groups: various orders of faqirs, yogis, sadhus, and ascetics; hereditary custodians of shrines; spirit mediums and exorcists; religious musicians and performers. These groups occupied distinct social positions, some commanded respect while others faced suspicion or marginalization. Their documentation illustrated religious landscape complexity extending beyond neat Hindu-Muslim-Sikh categorizations.

## Impact on Colonial Administration and Scholarship

The Glossary became standard reference for British administrators managing Punjab's complex social landscape. District officers consulted it when adjudicating customary law disputes, revenue officials used it understanding land tenure patterns, and military recruiters referenced it identifying communities eligible for martial races recruitment. The work's authority derived from official imprimatur and comprehensive coverage synthesizing decades of census operations and district-level documentation.

Post-independence scholarship on Punjab social history drew extensively on the Glossary despite recognizing its colonial-era biases and limitations. Historians of caste, agrarian systems, customary law, and religious traditions found it an invaluable source for early twentieth-century social conditions. Anthropologists studying kinship systems, marriage patterns, and social organization relied on its documentation of practices subsequently transformed by legal reforms, urbanization, and partition's demographic disruptions.

The work's influence extended to Pakistan and India's post-colonial administrative structures. Officers in both countries' civil services continued consulting it for historical context on communities spanning the international border. Scholars studying partition's social impacts used it establishing baseline conditions before 1947's traumatic population transfers and violence reshaped Punjab's social composition.

## Authors and Contributors

Horace Arthur Rose (1867-1933) entered Indian Civil Service in 1888, serving in Punjab throughout his career. His appointments included Assistant Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner, Superintendent of Punjab Census (1901), Superintendent of Ethnography (1901-1906), District Judge, and finally Judge in Punjab's High Court before retirement in 1918. His publications included Notes on Female Tattoo Designs in India (1902) and A Compendium of Punjab Customary Law (1911), reflecting sustained engagement with ethnographic documentation and legal anthropology.

Sir Denzil Ibbetson (1847-1908) conducted the 1881 census as Punjab's Deputy Commissioner, producing census report ethnographic appendices that established documentary foundations Rose later incorporated. Ibbetson's classification schemes and analytical observations shaped subsequent census ethnography across northern India. His administrative career culminated in Lieutenant-Governorship of Punjab (1907-1908).

Sir Edward Douglas Maclagan (1864-1952) superintended Punjab's 1891 census, expanding ethnographic coverage beyond Ibbetson's work. Maclagan later served as Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab (1919-1924) during tumultuous post-World War I period including Jallianwala Bagh massacre and subsequent political upheavals. His census ethnography contributed substantial material on Muslim communities and frontier tribal groups.

The collaborative nature reflected institutional continuity in Punjab administration, with later census superintendents building on predecessors' work to create cumulative documentation of regional social diversity. This institutional memory distinguished Punjab's ethnographic documentation from provinces where census operations lacked comparable continuity or depth.
