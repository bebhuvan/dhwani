description: |
  Published during a pivotal moment of cultural reclamation in late colonial India (1936), this comprehensive catalogue by Ramaprasad Chanda represents a critical scholarly intervention in documenting and interpreting medieval Indian sculptural traditions. As a prominent archaeologist with the Archaeological Survey of India, Chanda meticulously analyzed stone and bronze sculptures from the British Museum's collections, providing nuanced documentation of artistic developments across multiple regional sculptural schools from the seventh through sixteenth centuries. The work systematically examines sculptural traditions from key medieval dynasties, including the Pala of Bengal, Chola of South India, and Chandella of Central India, offering detailed iconographic identifications, stylistic attributions, and precise provenance documentation. Chanda's scholarship was emblematic of a broader nationalist intellectual movement that sought to recuperate and critically reframe Indian cultural heritage from colonial archaeological frameworks, challenging Eurocentric interpretations of Indian artistic production. By presenting rigorous scholarly analysis of sculptural artifacts, the catalogue not only documented material culture but also contributed to emerging discourses of cultural nationalism and aesthetic historiography. The work's methodological approach integrated archaeological precision with art historical interpretation, providing scholars and researchers with a foundational text for understanding the complex aesthetic and cultural transformations in medieval Indian sculpture. Chanda's meticulous documentation preserved critical visual and historical information about sculptural traditions that might otherwise have been marginalized or misinterpreted within colonial collecting practices, making this catalogue an important scholarly intervention in Indian art historical scholarship.

# Medieval Indian Sculpture in the British Museum

## Overview

Published by Trubner, London (1936), this 146-page catalogue documents medieval Indian sculptural holdings in the British Museum, providing systematic iconographic analysis and stylistic attribution for stone and bronze works dating from the seventh through sixteenth centuries. Chanda organizes material by regional schools—Pala (eastern India), Chola (Tamil Nadu), Chandella (central India)—correlating stylistic features with workshop traditions and patronage patterns established through Archaeological Survey research.

## About the Author

Ramaprasad Chanda (1873–1942) served as Superintendent of the Indian Museum, Calcutta, and contributed extensively to Archaeological Survey of India publications. His scholarship spanned archaeology, anthropology, numismatics, and art history, with particular focus on Bengal and eastern Indian material culture. He applied systematic classification methods developed in Indian archaeological practice to museum collections in Britain, facilitating cross-reference between dispersed monument sites and institutional holdings.

## The Work

The catalogue provides structured documentation for each sculpture:

**Iconographic Identification:**
- Deity or figure identification based on attributes, mudras, and iconographic conventions
- Epigraphic evidence where inscriptions survive
- Comparison with dated monuments for chronological placement

**Stylistic Analysis:**
- Regional school attribution (Pala, Chola, Chandella, etc.)
- Workshop characteristics and technical features
- Material analysis (stone types, bronze casting techniques)

**Provenance Documentation:**
- Acquisition history where known
- Original site context when documented
- Collection transfer records

**Regional Schools Covered:**
- **Pala sculpture** (Bihar-Bengal, 8th-12th centuries): Characteristic schist and basalt Buddhist and Hindu images
- **Chola bronzes** (Tamil Nadu, 10th-13th centuries): Lost-wax cast bronze icons for processional worship
- **Chandella stone sculpture** (Bundelkhand, 10th-13th centuries): Sandstone temple images
- Additional regional traditions from Deccan, Gujarat, and Kashmir

## Historical Context

The catalogue appeared during a period of intensive Archaeological Survey documentation establishing chronological frameworks and regional style classifications for Indian sculpture. Chanda's work facilitated scholarly access to dispersed collections, enabling comparative study between British Museum holdings and in-situ monuments. His systematic approach reflected early twentieth-century museum cataloguing standards while incorporating ASI field research methodologies.

## Significance

The catalogue remains valuable for:
- Documentation of specific pieces in British Museum collections
- Comparative material for regional style studies
- Historical record of collection composition in 1936
- Example of ASI cataloguing methodology applied to foreign institutions
- Cross-reference between museum collections and monument sites

Chanda's iconographic identifications and stylistic attributions provide baseline documentation, though later scholarship has refined some chronological placements and workshop attributions.
