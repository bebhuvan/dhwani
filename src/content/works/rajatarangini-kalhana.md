description: "Kalhana's Rajatarangini (River of Kings) stands as medieval India's most sophisticated historical chronicle, narrating Kashmir's political history from legendary origins through 1148-1150 CE across eight tarangas (books) comprising over 7,800 verses. Composed in elegant Sanskrit kavya style, this work transcends mere royal genealogy by incorporating critical historical methodology, including source evaluation, chronological precision, and psychological analysis of rulers' characters and motivations. Kalhana chronicles sixty-odd dynasties and individual kings, recording political intrigues, religious policies, architectural patronage, and moral evaluation of rulers based on dharmic kingship principles. M.A. Stein's monumental 1900 translation with extensive annotations revealed this masterwork to Western scholarship, establishing Kalhana as medieval India's Herodotus and the Rajatarangini as essential for understanding Kashmir's history, Sanskrit historical writing, and Indo-Islamic cultural synthesis."
