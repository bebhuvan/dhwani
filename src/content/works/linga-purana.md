description: "The Linga Purana stands among the eighteen Mahapuranas as principal Shaiva text systematically explaining linga symbolism and Shiva worship theology, comprising approximately 11,000 verses focused on establishing Shiva's cosmic supremacy and linga worship's spiritual efficacy. Composed between 8th-10th centuries CE (with core material likely around 800 CE), this work presents: comprehensive linga theology explaining the symbol's metaphysical significance as formless absolute Brahman made accessible to devotees through material representation, creation cosmology centered on Shiva as ultimate cause whose divine energy (Shakti) manifests phenomenal existence, extensive mythology including Shiva's twenty-eight manifestations demonstrating his multiple forms and functions, detailed descriptions of prominent Shiva temples and pilgrimage sites establishing sacred geography, systematic exposition of Shaiva philosophy synthesizing Vedanta metaphysics with Tantric practice, elaborate ritual protocols for linga worship including consecration procedures and daily service routines, and teachings on yoga, meditation, and devotional paths to liberation through Shiva consciousness. The text advances sophisticated theology positioning linga as supreme religious symbol: neither merely phallic representation nor abstract philosophical concept but rather unique synthesis of transcendent divinity and immanent presence enabling direct devotional relationship with ultimate reality. The Linga Purana's influence on Shaiva temple traditions, ritual practice, philosophical theology, and iconographic conventions proves foundational, establishing doctrinal and practical frameworks that continue shaping Shiva worship across India and South Asian regions."
