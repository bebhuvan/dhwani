description: "The Vishnu Purana stands among the eighteen Mahapuranas as one of the most important Vaishnava texts, systematically presenting cosmology, mythology, genealogies, and devotional theology centered on Vishnu as supreme deity. Composed between 3rd-10th centuries CE (with core material likely 400-500 CE), this work of approximately 23,000 verses across six books (amshas) covers: creation cosmology and cosmic cycles (kalpas and yugas), earth's geography including the mythical continents, detailed genealogies of gods and kings tracing solar and lunar dynasties, Krishna's complete life story from birth through death, and teachings on dharma, worship, and liberation through Vishnu devotion. H.H. Wilson's pioneering English translation (1840) made this foundational Puranic text accessible to Western scholarship, revealing sophisticated theological synthesis of Vedic, epic, and devotional traditions. The Vishnu Purana's influence on Hindu theology, iconography, and devotional practice proves foundational, establishing narrative and doctrinal frameworks for Vaishnavism across regional and sectarian boundaries."
