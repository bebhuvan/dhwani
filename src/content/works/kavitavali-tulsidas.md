description: "Collection of devotional poetry by Tulsidas composed in Braj Bhasha, celebrating Rama bhakti through diverse poetic forms and meters. Compiled circa 1600, contains passionate devotional verses expressing intense personal devotion, social commentary, philosophical reflection, and emotional intimacy with Rama. Differs from Ramcharitmanas in language, meter, and tone—more personal, immediate, and emotionally vulnerable. Showcases Tulsidas's mastery of Braj Bhasha poetic traditions and diversity of devotional expression."
