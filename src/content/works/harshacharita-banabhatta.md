description: "Banabhatta's Harshacharita (The Deeds of Harsha) stands as Sanskrit literature's most remarkable fusion of biography, autobiography, and historical chronicle, narrating Emperor Harsha's life while embedding the author's own journey to royal patronage. Composed circa 640 CE at Harsha's Kannauj court, this work combines historical veracity with ornate literary artistry, chronicling Harsha's accession following his father Prabhakaravardhana's death and elder brother Rajyavardhana's murder, his military campaigns consolidating North Indian power, and his patronage of Buddhism and learning. Bana innovatively weaves his autobiography into the frame narrative, describing his Brahmin upbringing, wandering poet years, and ultimate arrival at Harsha's court. Written in characteristically elaborate gadya-kavya prose featuring extended compounds and vivid descriptions, the Harshacharita provides invaluable historical information about 7th-century India corroborated by Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang's contemporary accounts, while exemplifying Sanskrit biographical literature at its literary zenith."
