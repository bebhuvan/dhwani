description: "Thiruvalluvar's Thirukkural represents Tamil literature's supreme ethical and philosophical achievement, comprising 1,330 couplets (kurals) organized into three books addressing virtue (aram), wealth (porul), and love (inbam)â€”the three legitimate life pursuits in Tamil tradition. Composed likely between 3rd century BCE and 5th century CE, each kural (couplet) of seven feet expresses complete thought with extraordinary economy, employing vivid imagery from agriculture, nature, and daily life to convey timeless wisdom. The first book (Chapters 1-38) addresses dharma: compassion, non-violence, virtue, hospitality, gratitude, self-control, and moral conduct. The second book (Chapters 39-108) concerns artha: kingship, administration, army, friendship, and prudent conduct. The third book (Chapters 109-133) explores kama: love's nature, union, separation, and reunion. The work's universal humanism, practical ethics, and literary excellence made it Tamil culture's foundational text, inspiring countless commentaries and translations. G.U. Pope's English translation introduced this masterpiece to global audiences, revealing Tamil civilization's sophisticated ethical philosophy and poetic genius."
