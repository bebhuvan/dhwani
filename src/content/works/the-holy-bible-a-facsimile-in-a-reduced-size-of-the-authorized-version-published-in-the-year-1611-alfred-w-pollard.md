Published by Oxford University Press in 1911 to commemorate the tercentenary of the Authorized Version, Alfred W. Pollard's facsimile edition represents a landmark achievement in biblical bibliography and textual scholarship. This meticulously produced volume offers readers access to one of the most influential texts in the English-speaking world while providing comprehensive scholarly apparatus that illuminates the complex history of English Bible translation from William Tyndale's pioneering New Testament of 1525 through the appearance of the King James Version in 1611.

The original 1611 King James Bible stands as a monument of collaborative scholarship unprecedented in its time. Commissioned following the Hampton Court Conference of January 1604, where Puritan leader John Rainolds proposed a new translation to King James I, the project mobilized the finest biblical scholars in England. By June 1604, fifty-four translators had been approved, though extant records confirm that forty-seven scholars actually participated in the monumental undertaking. These learned men were organized into six committees—two based at Westminster, two at Oxford, and two at Cambridge—each assigned specific portions of Scripture including the Apocrypha. The translation committees represented diverse theological perspectives, encompassing both Puritan sympathizers and High Churchmen, reflecting the king's ambition to produce an authoritative text that would unify the fractious religious factions within the Church of England.

The translation methodology employed rigorous collaborative procedures that ensured both scholarly precision and stylistic excellence. Each scholar within a committee independently prepared translations of assigned passages, which were then collectively compared and refined. Upon completion of an entire biblical book deemed satisfactory, the manuscript was circulated to other committees for review and critique. Disagreements among committees were resolved through conferences of principal scholars representing the various translation groups. The committees completed their sectional work by 1608, whereupon a General Committee of Review convened at Stationers' Hall, London, beginning in January 1609. For two years and nine months, the revisers labored individually and in conference, followed by a final comprehensive review conducted by a committee of twelve scholars. This exhaustive process culminated in publication in 1611 by Robert Barker, the King's Printer.

The 1611 first edition distinguished itself through elaborate typographical craftsmanship that married aesthetic beauty with functional design. Barker employed gothic blackletter type for the biblical text proper, a typeface choice that carried profound cultural and political significance. The blackletter tradition inherited from earlier centuries differentiated Anglo-Saxon England from Catholic Southern Europe, serving as much as religious-political statement as typographical convention. However, the 1611 edition also incorporated roman type for chapter headings, running titles, and chapter summaries, with italic type reserved for marginal commentaries. This sophisticated typographical hierarchy guided readers through the complex apparatus while maintaining the gravitas of the sacred text. The elaborate decorative elements and carefully designed page layouts reflected the royal patronage and theological importance of the undertaking.

The King James translators drew extensively upon the pioneering work of William Tyndale, whose New Testament translation from Greek, completed in 1525, established the foundation for all subsequent English biblical translation. Tyndale, who was martyred in 1536 for his heretical activities, created an English style of Bible translation tinged with Hebraisms that profoundly shaped the linguistic character of English Scripture for nearly four centuries. Scholarly analysis has determined that approximately 76 percent of the Old Testament and 84 percent of the New Testament text of the King James Version retains Tyndale's original wording. The translators of the Revised Standard Version, working in the 1940s, acknowledged that the King James Version owed its greatest debt, particularly in the New Testament, to Tyndale's foundational work. This continuity ensured that the 1611 translation preserved the vernacular power and theological precision that characterized Tyndale's martyred achievement.

Alfred W. Pollard brought to this commemorative facsimile edition exceptional credentials as bibliographer and textual scholar. Born in 1859, Pollard joined the British Museum's Department of Printed Books in 1883, advancing to Assistant Keeper in 1909 and Keeper in 1919. That same year he was appointed Professor of English Bibliography at the University of London, cementing his reputation as Britain's preeminent bibliographical authority. Pollard served as Honorary Secretary of the Bibliographical Society from 1893 to 1934 and edited The Library, the Society's journal, for thirty years from 1903 to 1934, for which service he received the Society's Gold Medal in 1929. His scholarship revolutionized the study of early printed books, most notably through Shakespeare Folios and Quartos (1909), which established new standards of rigorous bibliographical analysis for Shakespearean texts. With Gilbert Richard Redgrave, Pollard edited the monumental Short-Title Catalogue of Books Printed in England, Scotland, & Ireland and of English Books Printed Abroad, 1475-1640, published in 1926, which remains an indispensable reference work for early modern book history.

Pollard's bibliographical introduction, spanning pages 7 through 38 of the facsimile edition, represents a masterwork of historical scholarship and analytical rigor. Rather than providing mere antiquarian description, Pollard situates the 1611 Authorized Version within the broader evolution of English biblical translation, tracing the textual lineage from Tyndale through the Great Bible, the Geneva Bible, and the Bishops' Bible. His analysis illuminates the theological controversies, political exigencies, and linguistic innovations that shaped each successive translation. The introduction demonstrates Pollard's characteristic attention to material bibliography, examining typefaces, paper quality, printing practices, and publication circumstances. His discussion of the translation committees' composition and working methods draws upon archival documentation that he makes accessible to readers through the extensive illustrative documents occupying pages 39 through 142.

These documentary appendices constitute a remarkable scholarly resource, gathering primary source materials relating to the making, printing, and publishing of English Bible translations across nearly a century. The documents include royal proclamations, ecclesiastical correspondence, translators' prefatory materials, printers' records, and contemporary responses to successive translations. By presenting these materials in chronological sequence from Tyndale's 1525 New Testament to the 1611 Authorized Version, Pollard enables readers to trace the complex institutional, theological, and commercial networks that supported biblical translation in early modern England. This documentary apparatus transformed the facsimile from a mere reproduction into a comprehensive scholarly edition that served both bibliophilic and academic audiences.

The bibliographical importance of Pollard's 1911 edition extends beyond its commemorative function to encompass lasting scholarly contributions. By producing a reduced-size facsimile that maintained typographical fidelity to the 1611 original while rendering the text more accessible and affordable, Pollard democratized access to a rare book that few scholars could examine firsthand. The blackletter facsimile preserves the visual and material characteristics of the original edition, allowing twentieth-century readers to experience the text as its first audiences encountered it. Oxford University Press simultaneously issued an exact page-for-page reprint in roman type, both editions featuring Pollard's introductory essays. These parallel editions served complementary scholarly purposes: the blackletter facsimile satisfied bibliographical and historical interests, while the roman-type reprint facilitated linguistic and textual analysis. Together they exemplified the emerging standards of critical editing that Pollard championed throughout his career.

Pollard's edition appeared at a pivotal moment in the professionalization of biblical studies and English literary scholarship. The early twentieth century witnessed intensified scholarly interest in textual criticism, bibliography, and the material history of books. Pollard's meticulous documentation of the 1611 Bible's production circumstances, his careful analysis of its relationship to earlier translations, and his presentation of archival sources embodied the methodological rigor that characterized the new scholarly dispensation. The edition influenced subsequent generations of biblical scholars, bibliographers, and historians of the book, demonstrating how material analysis could illuminate textual meaning and cultural significance. The availability of Pollard's facsimile through institutional libraries and its later digitization by the Internet Archive has ensured its continued utility for contemporary scholarship.

The ongoing influence of the 1611 King James Version itself constitutes one of the most remarkable phenomena in the history of English letters. For over four centuries, the Authorized Version has exerted unparalleled influence on English literature, Christian thought, and the very fabric of English linguistic expression. Its phrasing has shaped not merely hymnody and liturgy but the idioms of everyday speech throughout the English-speaking world. Phrases such as "my brother's keeper," "the kiss of death," "the blind leading the blind," "fall from grace," "eye for an eye," and "a drop in the bucket" all owe their existence, or at least their widespread popularization, to the King James translation. The translators' lexical choices favored native Anglo-Saxon vocabulary, incorporating approximately 93 percent native English words with only 7 percent imports from Latin or continental languages, creating a vernacular directness that resonated across social classes.

The literary influence of the King James Version pervades English literature from the seventeenth century to the present day. From John Bunyan to Samuel Beckett, from John Milton to Toni Morrison, the King James Bible's imagery, narrative structures, and cadences have profoundly shaped literary imagination. Its allusions animate the symbolism of major works including John Steinbeck's East of Eden, Marilynne Robinson's Gilead, Flannery O'Connor's The Violent Bear It Away, Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, and William Blake's prophetic books. Writers as diverse as William Faulkner, Cormac McCarthy, and Marilynne Robinson have acknowledged the King James Bible as formative influence on their prose styles. The translation appeared at the precise historical moment when national languages were emerging in standardized forms, allowing it to shape the development of modern English at a crucial juncture. Its rhythmic prose and memorable phrasing established stylistic paradigms that influenced centuries of English literary production.

Despite the proliferation of modern translations employing more recently discovered ancient manuscripts and contemporary English idioms, the King James Version maintains remarkable vitality. A 2014 study titled "The Bible in American Life" found that 55 percent of Bible readers reported reaching most often for the King James Version, compared with only 19 percent who preferred the New International Version, the most popular modern translation. While mainstream Protestant denominations have increasingly adopted translations like the New International Version, English Standard Version, and New Revised Standard Version for liturgical and educational purposes, the King James Bible retains cultural authority and aesthetic prestige. Its archaic pronouns and Jacobean syntax, once criticized as impediments to comprehension, have paradoxically enhanced its appeal as dignified, timeless sacred language distinct from mundane contemporary discourse.

Pollard's facsimile edition has itself enjoyed enduring influence, remaining in print in various forms throughout the twentieth century and into the twenty-first. Modern reprints frequently reproduce Pollard's bibliographical introduction and documentary appendices, acknowledging their continuing scholarly value. The digitization of Pollard's edition by the Internet Archive has made this important resource freely accessible to a global audience of scholars, students, and general readers. Academic libraries worldwide maintain copies of the 1911 Oxford edition as essential reference works for biblical studies, early modern history, and the history of the English language. Citations of Pollard's introduction appear regularly in contemporary scholarship on biblical translation, early modern print culture, and the cultural history of the English-speaking world.

The enduring significance of both the 1611 Authorized Version and Pollard's scholarly edition testifies to the continuing relevance of careful bibliographical scholarship and historically informed textual editing. Pollard's work demonstrated that facsimile reproduction, when accompanied by rigorous scholarly apparatus, serves vital research and educational functions beyond mere antiquarian interest. His edition provided twentieth-century scholars essential access to a foundational text of English culture while modeling methodological standards for critical editing. The conjunction of the King James Bible's unmatched cultural influence with Pollard's bibliographical expertise produced a scholarly monument that illuminates both the historical circumstances of the 1611 translation and its ongoing resonance in contemporary religious, literary, and linguistic life. As one of the most widely disseminated texts in human history, the King James Bible continues to shape English expression, literary imagination, and spiritual discourse, while Pollard's facsimile edition remains an indispensable resource for understanding this remarkable translation's origins, character, and enduring power.
