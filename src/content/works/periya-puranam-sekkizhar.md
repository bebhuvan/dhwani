The Periya Puranam, also known as Tiruttondar Puranam ("Purana of the Holy Devotees"), stands as the twelfth and final book of the Tamil Shaiva canon. Composed by Sekkizhar (also known as Sekkilar Madhavadigal Ramadeva) in the 12th century CE, this monumental work contains 4,286 verses that chronicle the hagiographies of the sixty-three Nayanars, the canonical saints of Tamil Shaivism. The text represents a comprehensive expansion of earlier brief accounts, transforming Sundarar's 11-verse Tiruttondar Tokai (8th century CE) and Nambiyandar Nambi's 89 quatrains into an epic-scale literary achievement.

Sekkizhar served as Chief Minister at the court of the Chola emperor Kulottunga II (ruled 1133-1150 CE). Historical accounts indicate that Sekkizhar undertook this literary project specifically to redirect the king's attention from the Jain text Chivaka Chintamani, which Sekkizhar considered heretical. The emperor had become absorbed in this erotic literature, causing concern for the religiously devout minister. Upon Sekkizhar's exhortation, Kulottunga II commissioned him to compose a great poem expounding the lives of the Shaiva saints. Sekkizhar utilized his ministerial access to collect historical data and composed the work in the Thousand Pillared Hall of the Chidambaram temple. The public presentation of the completed Periya Puranam occurred between April 4, 1139 and April 22, 1140 CE at the Thillai Nataraja Temple.

The sixty-three Nayanars whose lives the text documents flourished during the 6th through 8th centuries CE. These devotees came from diverse social backgrounds including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, demonstrating the egalitarian nature of the bhakti movement. The four most prominent Nayanars are collectively termed the Nalvar ("The Four"): Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar (composers of the Tevaram hymns), along with Manikkavasagar. These figures are revered as Samayacharyas (teachers of the faith) within the Tamil Shaiva tradition. Sundarar himself compiled the original list of the sixty-three saints, and Nambiyandar Nambi expanded this list during his compilation of the Tirumurai collection, including Sundarar and his parents among the honored devotees.

The Nayanars played a foundational role in the South Indian bhakti movement, possibly beginning as early as the 3rd century CE. Their revolutionary approach advocated emotional bonding and love for Shiva while deemphasizing Vedic ritualism and Upanishadic philosophical abstraction. This theological shift enabled non-Brahmins to pursue moksha (spiritual liberation), democratizing religious practice. The Nayanars' devotional hymns, known as Tevaram, articulated profound spiritual experiences and became essential liturgical texts within Tamil Shaivism. Their collective contributions established the philosophical framework of Shaiva Siddhanta, a dualist theological system centered on Shiva that continues to guide Shaiva practice. The Nayanars' bhakti approach paralleled the contemporary Alvars, Vaishnava saints devoted to Vishnu, and together these two movements transformed early medieval South Indian religious culture.

The Periya Puranam earned immediate recognition as a Tamil Veda (Tamil Marai), often designated the "fifth Veda" despite Tamil literature already possessing four recognized Vedas. This designation reflects the text's profound spiritual authority and theological significance. The work's voluminous nature and literary excellence justified its title "Periya Puranam" (Great Purana). The Tamil Shaiva canon comprises twelve Tirumurais authored by twenty-six saints, collectively containing more than 20,000 verses. The Periya Puranam, as the twelfth and concluding Tirumurai, represents the culmination of this canonical tradition. Sekkizhar's work expanded the hagiographic tradition to epic proportions, elaborating brief earlier accounts into detailed narratives of devotional excellence.

Scholars have acclaimed the Periya Puranam as possessing the highest literary standards, epitomizing Chola cultural achievement during the dynasty's golden age. The text functions simultaneously as biography, purana, and revolutionary devotional literature, recognized equally for its poetic beauty and spiritual depth. Academic analysis characterizes it as an encyclopedic lexicological achievement and literary masterpiece. The work's narrative scope encompasses not merely biographical facts but detailed accounts of devotional exploits, miraculous events, and spiritual realizations that illustrate the diverse paths to divine union. Each saint's story demonstrates particular aspects of Shaiva devotion, from unwavering loyalty to extreme asceticism to ecstatic mystical experience.

The Periya Puranam's influence on Tamil Shaivite worship has been profound and enduring. The text established authoritative accounts of the Nayanars' lives, providing devotional models that shaped subsequent Shaiva practice. The hagiographies detailed in Sekkizhar's verses inform temple rituals, festival celebrations, and devotional recitation across Tamil Shaiva communities. The work integrated historical memory with theological instruction, making the abstract principles of Shaiva Siddhanta accessible through concrete narrative examples. The text's portrayal of saints from all social strata reinforced bhakti theology's egalitarian principles, validating diverse forms of devotion and multiple paths to spiritual attainment.

The relationship between the Periya Puranam and the earlier Tirumurai collections demonstrates the cumulative development of Tamil Shaiva literature. The first eleven Tirumurais contain the hymns composed by the Nayanars themselves, while the twelfth preserves their hagiographies. This structure creates a comprehensive religious corpus combining liturgical poetry with biographical context, enabling worshippers to understand the devotional experiences that generated the hymns. Sekkizhar's work thus functions as both historical documentation and theological commentary, explicating the spiritual states that produced the canonical devotional literature.

The Periya Puranam's composition within the Chidambaram temple's Thousand Pillared Hall carries symbolic significance. Chidambaram serves as one of Tamil Shaivism's most sacred sites, housing the cosmic dance (Ananda Tandava) of Nataraja (Shiva as Lord of Dance). Composing this definitive Shaiva hagiography within this sacred architectural space connected the text to Tamil Shaivism's ritual and theological center. The temple's association with divine dance imagery parallels the text's portrayal of devotion as a dynamic, embodied practice rather than merely intellectual assent.

Within the broader context of the Tamil Shaiva Siddhanta tradition, the Periya Puranam occupies a crucial position. Shaiva Siddhanta draws primarily on Tamil devotional hymns composed between the 5th and 9th centuries, collectively known as Tirumurai. The philosophical system articulates dualist teachings regarding Shiva, distinguishing soul (pasu), bonds (pasa), and lord (pati). The Periya Puranam illustrates these abstract theological categories through narrative accounts of individuals who achieved spiritual liberation through various devotional practices. The text thereby bridges philosophical theology and lived religious experience, demonstrating how theoretical principles manifest in actual spiritual development.

The Periya Puranam's influence extended beyond strictly religious contexts to shape Tamil literary culture more broadly. The work established hagiography as a major Tamil literary genre, inspiring subsequent biographical compositions. Its narrative techniques, poetic conventions, and structural organization influenced Tamil literary aesthetics. The text demonstrated how devotional content could achieve the highest literary standards, validating religious literature as worthy of sophisticated artistic treatment. This integration of spiritual and aesthetic excellence characterized Chola-period Tamil culture and continued to influence Tamil literary production.

The text's enduring significance derives from its multifaceted achievement: comprehensive historical documentation of the Nayanar tradition, theological exposition of Shaiva Siddhanta principles, literary masterpiece exemplifying Chola cultural heights, and practical devotional manual providing models for spiritual practice. The Periya Puranam continues to be recited, studied, and revered within Tamil Shaiva communities, maintaining its status as authoritative scripture. The work's combination of historical specificity, theological depth, literary artistry, and devotional accessibility accounts for its sustained influence across nearly nine centuries. Modern scholarship recognizes the text as essential primary source material for understanding medieval South Indian religious culture, Tamil literary development, and the bhakti movement's transformative impact on Hindu religious practice.
