description: "Ashvaghosa's Buddhacharita represents the first complete literary biography of Buddha, presenting his life through Sanskrit mahakavya form with poetic excellence rivaling classical secular epics while conveying profound Buddhist teachings. Composed around 1st-2nd century CE, this masterwork of 28 cantos (17 surviving in Sanskrit, remainder preserved through Chinese-Tibetan translations) narrates Buddha's journey from princely luxury through renunciation to enlightenment and teaching ministry. The epic employs Kalidasa-level poetic sophistication—elaborate metaphors, psychological insight, philosophical depth—demonstrating that Buddhist themes could inspire literary art equaling secular poetry. Beyond biographical narrative, Ashvaghosa presents Buddhist philosophy accessibly: suffering's universality, desire as suffering's cause, renunciation's necessity, meditation's transformative power, and enlightenment as liberation. The work influenced Buddhist literature across Asia, inspiring biographical traditions in multiple languages, while proving Buddhist Sanskrit poetry's artistic legitimacy. E.H. Johnston's critical edition and translation introduced this masterpiece to modern scholarship, revealing early Buddhist community's literary sophistication and Ashvaghosa's genius combining religious devotion with poetic artistry."
