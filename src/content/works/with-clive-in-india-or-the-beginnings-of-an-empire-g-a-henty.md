## Historical Context and Publication

George Alfred Henty (1832-1902) published "With Clive in India; or, The Beginnings of an Empire" in 1884 through the London publishing house Blackie and Son. An English novelist and war correspondent, Henty served in the Crimean War and worked primarily for the London Standard, experiences that informed his prolific literary output. Between 1882 and his death in 1902, Henty produced three to four books annually under contract with Blackie, becoming "the most popular Boy's author of his day," with the publisher estimating 150,000 Henty books produced annually at the height of his popularity. The novel featured twelve monochrome plates illustrated by Gordon Browne and proved so commercially successful that a reprint was required in its first year of publication.

## Narrative Structure and Historical Setting

The novel follows Charlie Marryat, a young clerk recruited by the British East India Company, during the critical period between Robert Clive's arrival in India as a writer and the close of his career. This timeframe witnessed the transformation of English traders existing on sufferance of native princes into masters of Bengal and much of southern India. The protagonist, after his father's death, secures a writership through his uncle's connections and travels to Madras, where he encounters Clive, who had risen from clerk to military leader. The narrative shifts when Charlie enlists as a private soldier under Clive during the Anglo-French conflicts for control of Indian territories, participating in significant military engagements including the Siege of Arcot and the Battle of Plassey.

## The Battle of Plassey and Colonial Expansion

The novel dramatizes the pivotal Battle of Plassey, fought on 23 June 1757, where Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Clive (1725-1774) led approximately 3,000 troops, including 2,100 Indian sepoys and 800 Europeans, against Siraj-ud-Daulah's forces of 50,000 men with 16,000 cavalry and 50 field guns. Clive's tactical victory established British military and economic dominance on the Indian subcontinent. Following Plassey, Clive secured the diwani in 1765, granting the East India Company the right to collect tax and customs revenue of Bengal from Emperor Shah Alam II. This transformation marked the Company's evolution from commercial enterprise to imperial power, necessitating extensive civil and military administration for tax collection and territorial policing.

## Victorian Values and Educational Purpose

Henty's work exemplifies late Victorian boys' adventure fiction designed to inculcate specific moral and imperial values. His protagonists, termed "Henty Heroes," uniformly exhibit intelligence, courage, honesty, resourcefulness, and modesty, embodying concepts of "pluck," "character," and "honour" representing the secular and materialistic spirit of the late Victorian Empire. The novels functioned as character-building instruments, promoting sportsmanship, manliness, devotion to duty, courage, enterprise, and loyalty to country. These values reflected the public school ethos intended to prepare boys for lives of imperial service. Imperial heroes in Henty's narratives served as "bastions of British strength, integrity, humility, embodying the imperial values of masculinity and religious fidelity" that Henty sought to instill in impressionable readers.

## Imperial Ideology and Literary Characteristics

"With Clive in India" represents a prototype of literature emerging with British New Imperialism in the 1870s. Henty's African and Asian novels became indicative of inherent imperial ideology in mid-to-late nineteenth-century boys' adventure fiction, celebrating empire with jingoistic enthusiasm particularly during the Boer War period. Henty remained "a firm believer in the uniqueness of the European and Anglo-Saxon," and his narratives promoted the superiority of muscular masculinity derived from patriarchal Victorian values and imperial ideology. The novel presents a didactic perspective on imperialism as morally justified endeavor, portraying colonization as beneficial to colonized peoples. Henty's literary style, while commercially successful, has been characterized as "plebian set-piece" writing that eschewed female characters and glorified imperialism.

## Critical Reception and Contemporary Perspectives

During his lifetime, Henty faced accusations of xenophobia and racism, with critics challenging his enthusiastic imperialism. His work has been faulted for historical inaccuracies and one-dimensional representations of colonized societies. Twentieth-century literary scholarship initially dismissed popular imperial adventure novels flourishing between the 1870s and 1910s as lacking literary merit. However, recent academic attention, including Mawuena Kossi Logan's "Narrating Africa: George Henty and the fiction of empire," examines Henty's political and social views and his representation of colonized regions from postcolonial perspectives. In the 1990s, conservative Christian and homeschooling communities adopted Henty's books for their wholesome protagonists, though these works continue to face criticism for jingoism and racial ideology. Twenty-first-century postcolonial criticism addresses the tension between Henty's historical significance in children's literature and the problematic imperial ideologies embedded in his narratives, questioning nostalgic readings that risk perpetuating dangerous historical patterns of white dominance advocacy.

## Literary Legacy and Availability

Of Henty's 122 books, most were written for children and published by Blackie and Son, though he also produced adult novels, non-fiction, and short stories. His children's novels typically featured boys or young men navigating troubled historical periods from the Punic War to the Napoleonic Wars and American Civil War. "With Clive in India" remains available through Project Gutenberg as a free ebook and continues in print through modern publishers. The novel exemplifies Henty's formula of placing fictional protagonists alongside historical figures in narratives designed to educate young readers about British imperial history while promoting specific moral and ideological frameworks that reflected late Victorian imperial values and anxieties.
