# ನಮ್ಮ ಕರ್ನಾಟಕ (Namma Karnataka)

## Overview

T.V. Venkatachala Sastry's *ನಮ್ಮ ಕರ್ನಾಟಕ* (Namma Karnataka, "Our Karnataka"), published in 1983, synthesizes Karnataka's literary and cultural heritage for Kannada-speaking audiences during a period when regional identity and cultural self-understanding were being actively negotiated within India's federal democratic framework. The 183-page work represents mature scholarship from a figure who, over six decades, established himself as preeminent authority on Kannada language, literature, and cultural history through teaching at the University of Mysore, directing the Kannada Adhyayana Samsthe (Kannada Studies Institute), and producing over one hundred scholarly publications encompassing grammar, prosody, literary history, critical analysis, biography, and textual editing.

The work's title—*Namma Karnataka* ("Our Karnataka")—employs the possessive "our" that simultaneously asserts collective ownership and inclusive belonging, reflecting the cultural-political function of such syntheses: defining shared regional heritage while addressing diverse Kannada-speaking audiences across caste, class, religious, and sub-regional differences. The 1983 publication date situates the work twenty-seven years after the 1956 States Reorganisation Act created unified Karnataka from territories previously divided among Bombay State, Hyderabad State, Madras State, and the princely state of Mysore. This reorganization along linguistic lines represented partial fulfillment of long-standing demands for Kannada-speaking unity, yet also necessitated ongoing cultural work articulating what unified these diverse regions and populations beyond administrative convenience.

Sastry's credentials—recognized by Sanskrit scholar Sheldon Pollock as "greatest living scholar in the field of old Kannada"—lent particular authority to this synthesis. His expertise spanning two millennia of Kannada literary production enabled comprehensive treatment connecting ancient classical texts, medieval devotional and courtly literature, and modern writing within continuous tradition while acknowledging historical transformations and diversity. His combination of traditional learning and modern scholarly methods, reflected in his Smartha Brahmin background's Sanskrit and Vedanta training alongside University of Mysore's secular academic education, positioned him to mediate between indigenous knowledge systems and contemporary academic frameworks.

## About the Author

Togere Venkatasubbasastry Venkatachala Sastry was born on 26 August 1933 at Harohalli village in Kanakapura taluk of Bangalore district into Smartha Brahmin family adhering to Advaita Vedanta philosophy and connected to the Sringeri Sharada Peetham tradition. This background provided foundation in Sanskrit learning and Vedantic philosophy that would inform his subsequent scholarly work, even as he pursued modern secular education. He completed intermediate course in 1947-48, pursuing undergraduate and postgraduate degrees at University of Mysore from 1948 through 1954, coinciding with crucial period in Indian and Karnataka history encompassing independence, partition, and the debates culminating in states reorganization.

His academic career at the University of Mysore spanned several decades, teaching Kannada as professor and serving as Director of Kannada Adhyayana Samsthe before retiring in 1994. His teaching influenced multiple generations of Kannada scholars and writers, transmitting both technical linguistic knowledge and broader appreciation for Kannada's literary heritage. His position directing the Kannada Studies Institute enabled institutional support for research, publication, and scholarly exchange advancing Kannada studies as rigorous academic field.

His scholarly production demonstrated remarkable range and productivity. Over one hundred books, translations, edited volumes, and contributions to felicitation volumes addressed diverse topics: Kannada grammar's intricate structures across historical periods; prosody (chandas) and metrical systems employed in classical and medieval Kannada poetry; comprehensive histories of Kannada literature spanning two millennia; critical analyses of major authors and texts; biographical studies of significant literary figures; and edited collections preserving and disseminating scholarly work. This productivity reflected both individual capacity and commitment to documenting and analyzing Kannada's literary heritage comprehensively.

His expertise in Old Kannada (Halegannada)—the language's earliest literary form (approximately 450-1200 CE) documented in inscriptions and classical texts—proved particularly significant. Old Kannada studies require paleographical skills for reading ancient inscriptions, philological expertise for analyzing archaic linguistic forms, literary-historical knowledge for contextualizing texts, and Sanskrit competence for understanding the extensive Sanskrit-Kannada interactions characterizing classical Karnataka literature. Sastry's mastery of these requirements enabled authoritative work on classical period that few contemporary scholars could match, earning Sheldon Pollock's assessment of his preeminence.

Recognition for his contributions included the Karnataka Sahitya Akademi Honorary Award in 1997, the state's highest literary honor, acknowledging sustained scholarship advancing Kannada literature and language studies. He presided over the Dharmasthala Literary Festival in 2002, indicating esteem within Karnataka's literary community and recognition as senior scholarly authority. These honors reflected not merely individual achievement but acknowledgment of his role in establishing and maintaining high standards for Kannada scholarship, training subsequent generations, and preserving and interpreting Karnataka's literary heritage for contemporary audiences.

## Historical and Cultural Context

*Namma Karnataka*'s 1983 publication occurred during specific moment in Karnataka's cultural and political development. The 1956 States Reorganisation Act, creating linguistic states, had fundamentally altered South Indian political geography. For Kannada speakers, unification represented achievement of long-sought objective articulated through decades of advocacy by Aluru Venkata Rao's Karnataka Ekikarana movement and other organizations demanding Kannada-speaking territories' consolidation. However, creating administrative unity left open question of cultural unity: what shared heritage and identity would bind populations from diverse regions—coastal Karnataka, North Karnataka, South Karnataka, and formerly separate princely territories—into cohesive cultural community?

Literary and cultural histories like *Namma Karnataka* participated in this identity-formation project. By presenting Karnataka's literary heritage as unified tradition spanning centuries and transcending earlier political divisions, such works provided cultural content for political unity. They demonstrated Kannada's continuous literary vitality, sophisticated cultural achievements, and distinctive regional character within broader Indian civilization. They educated younger generations about heritage they inherited, potentially strengthening cultural attachment and regional pride.

The 1980s represented period of significant linguistic politics in Karnataka. The 1986 Gokak Committee report recommended making Kannada mandatory medium of instruction in schools, generating extensive public debate. Language issues in neighboring states—particularly regarding Karnataka-Maharashtra border disputes and linguistic minorities' rights—kept language politics prominent. Within this charged environment, scholarly works affirming Kannada's literary richness and historical depth contributed to arguments for language's protection and promotion.

Simultaneously, the 1980s witnessed rapid social and economic changes. Bangalore's emergence as technology and industry center was transforming Karnataka's economy and urban landscape. Migration brought linguistic diversity to cities, raising questions about Kannada's status. Global cultural influences through media and commerce potentially threatened regional cultural distinctiveness. In this context, works preserving and disseminating Karnataka heritage served functions beyond purely scholarly documentation, potentially countering perceived threats to regional cultural identity.

## Scholarly Approach and Significance

Sastry's scholarship characteristically combined rigorous philological analysis with accessible exposition. His grammatical works provided technical analyses suitable for linguistic specialists while also serving students learning Kannada's structural complexities. His literary histories situated individual works and authors within broader developments while maintaining attention to specific textual details. This dual orientation—specialist rigor with general accessibility—characterized *Namma Karnataka*'s likely approach, making Karnataka heritage comprehensible for educated general readers while maintaining scholarly credibility.

His extensive work on Kannada prosody and metrics demonstrated the sophistication of classical Kannada poetics, comparing favorably with Sanskrit prosodic traditions while exhibiting distinctive features. This work countered assumptions that regional-language literatures merely imitated Sanskrit models, instead revealing autonomous aesthetic traditions and innovations. Such scholarly demonstration of Kannada literature's sophistication contributed to cultural self-respect and challenged hierarchies privileging Sanskrit over vernacular literatures.

His textual editing and biographical studies preserved knowledge of literary figures and works that might otherwise be forgotten, ensuring continuity of literary memory across generations. His translations made texts from different periods accessible to contemporary readers, bridging historical and linguistic distances. This varied scholarly activity collectively maintained and transmitted Karnataka's literary heritage while adapting it to contemporary contexts and audiences.

## Contemporary Relevance and Legacy

For contemporary readers and students of Kannada literature and Karnataka culture, works like *Namma Karnataka* provide accessible introductions to regional heritage from authoritative scholarly perspective. They serve educational functions in schools and universities, cultural organizations, and general public discourse about Karnataka identity. They document specific moment's understanding of Karnataka heritage, revealing how earlier generations conceptualized their cultural traditions.

The digitization and online availability through the Digital Library of India enables broader access than print-only circulation allowed, potentially reaching global Kannada-speaking diaspora communities seeking connections to regional heritage, scholars internationally studying Kannada literature and South Indian culture, and younger generations in Karnataka navigating relationships between regional, national, and global identities.

Sastry's broader legacy extends beyond individual publications to his role in establishing Kannada studies as rigorous academic field, training scholarly generations, and demonstrating that regional-language scholarship could achieve international recognition while maintaining deep rootedness in indigenous knowledge traditions. His combination of traditional learning and modern scholarship provided model for subsequent scholars navigating between Sanskrit panditic traditions and secular university education, between regional cultural commitment and cosmopolitan intellectual exchange.
