# Bharatendu Ke Nibandh (Essays of Bharatendu)

## Overview

This collection assembles essays by Bharatendu Harishchandra (1850–1885), designated "Father of Modern Hindi Literature" and "Bharatendu" (Moon of India) for transforming Hindi prose. The essays span social reform, language politics, cultural commentary, and literary criticism, written during the Bharatendu Yuga (Bharatendu Era, 1868–1885) that defined modern Hindi's developmental path.

## Bharatendu Harishchandra (1850-1885)

Born in Varanasi to wealthy family, Harishchandra dedicated his short life (died age 34) to Hindi literature and cultural nationalism. He founded magazines (*Kavi Vachan Sudha*, *Harishchandra's Magazine*), wrote plays, poetry, and essays, and cultivated a literary circle (*Bharatendu Mandal*) promoting Hindi over Urdu-Persian as North India's literary language.

His innovations established templates for modern Hindi:

- Standardized prose style balancing Sanskrit vocabulary with colloquial clarity
- Developed essay form (*nibandh*) for intellectual discourse
- Created modern Hindi drama adapting Sanskrit and Bengali models
- Championed Hindi as vehicle for nationalist cultural expression

## The Essays

**Topics:**

- Social reform: caste system, women's education, widow remarriage
- Language politics: Hindi versus Urdu; Nagari script promotion
- Economic critique: British exploitation of Indian resources
- Cultural commentary: theater, literature, traditional practices
- Religious thought: Hinduism's reform and modernization

**Style:** Harishchandra developed accessible Hindi prose avoiding both excessive Persianization and over-Sanskritization. His essays balance clarity with literary quality, establishing middle register appropriate for serious intellectual work in Hindi.

**Rhetorical Technique:** Combines rational argument with emotional appeal; uses humor and irony; addresses readers directly; employs traditional Indian rhetorical devices alongside Western essay conventions.

## Literary Significance

These essays demonstrated Hindi prose could handle complex ideas—philosophy, economics, politics—previously conducted in Sanskrit, Persian, or English. This expansion of Hindi's functional range was crucial for establishing it as complete literary language capable of all discourse modes.

Harishchandra's prose style influenced generations of Hindi writers. The Bharatendu Yuga's conventions—vocabulary choices, sentence structures, rhetorical strategies—shaped Hindi prose development into the 20th century.

## Historical Context

The essays emerged during debates about language, script, and cultural identity in colonial North India. Hindi-Urdu controversy intensified as communities defined themselves partly through language choices. Harishchandra's advocacy positioned Hindi as Hindu-identified cultural nationalism's vehicle.

His social reform essays engaged with contemporary movements: Brahmo Samaj, Arya Samaj, widow remarriage campaigns, women's education initiatives. While critical of British rule's economic impact, he advocated selective modernization and reform of Hindu practices.

## The Bharatendu Mandal

Harishchandra gathered writers and intellectuals promoting Hindi literature and cultural revival. This "Bharatendu Circle" included Pratap Narayan Misra, Ambika Dutt Vyas, and others who continued his project after his early death. The Mandal established networks supporting Hindi literary production.

## Influence

The Dwivedi Yuga (1893–1918) following Harishchandra's death refined his prose innovations. Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi's editorial work built on Harishchandra's linguistic foundations. Subsequent Hindi movements—Chhayavad poetry, Progressive Writers—operated in literary space Harishchandra helped create.
