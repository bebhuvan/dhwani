## Scholarly Overview

"Research Methodology" by B.M. Jain, originally published in 1945, represents a pioneering contribution to social sciences research literature in Hindi-medium academic discourse. This foundational text emerged during a transformative period in Indian higher education, coinciding with the pre-independence era when indigenous scholarly works in vernacular languages were gaining institutional recognition. The work's publication by Research Publication In Social Sciences underscores its orientation toward establishing rigorous research frameworks within the Indian academic context.

## Publication Details and Provenance

The textbook comprises 274 pages and was published under the imprint of Research Publication In Social Sciences, with the source library identified as Prakrit Bharati Academy in Jaipur. The historical significance of this work is preserved through its digitization by Banasthali University, now available through the Digital Library of India collection on the Internet Archive. The scanning and preservation efforts reflect the recognition of this text as part of India's intellectual heritage, particularly within the JaiGyan: Bharat Ek Khoj initiative. Multiple digital formats including PDF, EPUB, and OCR-processed searchable text using Tesseract 5.0 with Devanagari script recognition ensure contemporary accessibility while maintaining fidelity to the original publication.

## Pedagogical Approach and Methodological Framework

As a mid-twentieth century text on research methodology, Jain's work emerged during the formative years of systematic social science research in India. The pedagogical approach reflects the intellectual currents of the 1940s, when research methodology as a distinct academic discipline was being codified in Indian universities. The text addresses fundamental aspects of survey methodology, conceptualized as the systematic study of survey methods, with particular emphasis on applied statistics within human-research contexts. This framework encompasses the sampling of individuals, populations, and statistical techniques essential for empirical investigation in the social sciences.

The methodological orientation of the text aligns with the positivist tradition dominant in mid-twentieth century social research, emphasizing systematic observation, measurement, and analysis. Given the historical context, the work likely synthesizes Western research traditions with considerations relevant to the Indian sociocultural milieu, addressing practical challenges faced by researchers in post-colonial academic institutions. The focus on survey methodology suggests attention to both theoretical foundations and practical applications, characteristic of textbooks designed for graduate-level instruction.

## Coverage of Quantitative and Qualitative Methods

While specific chapter-by-chapter analysis is limited by the text's age and language, the framework established in "Research Methodology" addresses core components of empirical research dominant in the 1940s era. The emphasis on survey methodology inherently encompasses quantitative approaches, including sampling theory, data collection instruments such as questionnaires and structured interviews, and statistical analysis techniques appropriate for the period. The text's grounding in applied statistics suggests coverage of descriptive statistics, frequency distributions, measures of central tendency and dispersion, and elementary inferential procedures.

The treatment of qualitative dimensions, while likely less developed than in contemporary research methodology texts, would have addressed observational techniques, documentary analysis, and case study methods prevalent in social sciences research of that era. The integration of both approaches reflects an understanding of methodological pluralism necessary for comprehensive social investigation, though weighted toward quantitative rigor consistent with mid-century epistemological preferences.

## Target Audience and Academic Context

The primary target audience for Jain's "Research Methodology" comprises Hindi-medium graduate students and researchers in social sciences disciplines, including economics, sociology, political science, history, and education. The choice of Hindi as the medium of instruction reflects a deliberate effort to democratize research education beyond English-educated elite circles, making advanced methodological training accessible to students from vernacular educational backgrounds. This linguistic choice was particularly significant during the pre- and post-independence periods when Hindi was being promoted as a national language and medium of higher education.

The text serves as a foundational resource for M.A., M.Phil., and early doctoral students requiring systematic training in research design, data collection, and analysis. Its comprehensiveness at 274 pages suggests coverage sufficient for semester-long courses in research methodology, typically required across social science disciplines. The interdisciplinary orientation makes it suitable for students across multiple departments, providing common methodological vocabulary and frameworks essential for scholarly communication.

## Use in Indian Universities

"Research Methodology" by B.M. Jain occupies a distinctive place in the genealogy of Hindi-medium research education in Indian universities. Its association with Banasthali University, which undertook its digitization, suggests historical use within that institution's curriculum. Banasthali Vidyapith, established as a women's university in 1935, has maintained strong traditions in social sciences education with faculties encompassing economics, history, political science, sociology, and psychology. The university's bilingual pedagogical system, offering instruction and materials in both Hindi and English, created an ideal environment for texts like Jain's to serve Hindi-medium students while complementing English-language methodological literature.

The text's utility extends beyond Banasthali to other Hindi-medium universities and colleges across Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, and other Hindi-speaking states where vernacular instruction remained prevalent through the mid-to-late twentieth century. While contemporary research methodology courses increasingly rely on more recent texts such as C.R. Kothari's widely prescribed "Research Methodology: Methods and Techniques" (available in multiple languages including Hindi), Jain's 1945 work represents an important historical benchmark in the development of indigenous research methodology pedagogy.

The preservation and digitization of this text through the Digital Library of India initiative ensures its continued availability as a reference work for historians of Indian education, scholars studying the development of social sciences in India, and researchers interested in the evolution of methodological thought in vernacular academic discourse. Its open access through the Internet Archive facilitates scholarly consultation and comparative analysis with contemporary methodological texts, illuminating changes in research paradigms, statistical techniques, and epistemological assumptions over eight decades of Indian social science development.

## Historical and Contemporary Significance

As an artifact of mid-twentieth century Indian academic publishing, "Research Methodology" reflects the intellectual aspirations of a nascent independent nation building its educational infrastructure. The 1945 publication date positions it at the cusp of independence, embodying efforts to create scholarly resources in Indian languages that could support autonomous academic traditions. The text's survival and digitization underscore recognition of its historical value, even as pedagogical needs have evolved substantially with advances in statistical computing, mixed methods research, qualitative software, and contemporary research ethics frameworks.

For contemporary researchers, Jain's work offers insight into the foundations upon which current methodological sophistication has been built, illustrating both continuities and transformations in research training. The text serves as a reminder of the long-standing commitment within Indian higher education to making research literacy accessible across linguistic communities, a principle that continues to inform debates about medium of instruction and equitable access to advanced education.
