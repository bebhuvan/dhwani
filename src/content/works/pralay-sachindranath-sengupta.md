# Pralay

## Overview

Published by Gopaldas Majumder, Calcutta (1932), this 120-page Bengali drama channels interwar social and political anxieties into concentrated theatrical form. The title "Pralay" (deluge/catastrophe) frames the dramatic action as institutional and moral crisis, using family conflicts to interrogate larger questions of duty, tradition, and changing social orders during Bengal's turbulent nationalist period.

## About the Author

Sachindranath Sengupta (1891–1961) established himself as a significant figure in early twentieth-century Bengali theatre, writing numerous historical, political, and social dramas. His interwar plays characteristically juxtapose institutional duty with personal obligation, examining the human costs of social transition. His most popular work, "Sirajuddaula," dealt with Bengal's eighteenth-century political history, while social dramas like "Pralay," "Raktakamal" (1929), "Jhader Rate" (1931), and "Nursing Home" (1933) explored contemporary ethical dilemmas through realistic domestic settings.

## The Work

**Dramatic Technique:**
- Compressed dialogue avoiding the lyrical monologues of earlier Bengali theatre
- Ensemble construction distributing dramatic weight across multiple characters
- Realistic settings grounding abstract moral questions in recognizable social contexts

**Thematic Concerns:**
- Economic strain and class tensions in 1930s Bengal
- Political unrest and nationalist ferment
- Changing social mores and generational conflict
- Institutional failures and individual moral choice
- The play's "deluge" operates simultaneously as economic crisis, ethical breakdown, and social upheaval

**Historical Context:**
The early 1930s marked intensified debates about labor, nationalism, and social reform in Bengal. Theatre companies navigated between commercial viability, political expression, and artistic innovation, often mounting plays engaging topical concerns while managing colonial censorship and audience expectations. Sengupta's work emerged from this milieu, representing a transitional style between earlier melodramatic conventions and post-independence progressive theatre.

## Theatrical Significance

"Pralay" exemplifies the interwar Bengali "problem play," presenting dilemmas without didactic resolutions. The compressed dramatic structure and ensemble technique influenced later progressive theatre practitioners, while the thematic engagement with social crisis positioned Bengali theatre as a space for examining contemporary anxieties. The play bridges late-colonial commercial theatre and post-independence experimental movements.

## Performance Considerations

The text demands:
- Brisk pacing reflecting interwar urgency
- Ensemble playing without star-centered interpretation
- Minimal but precise staging supporting dialogue-centered dramaturgy
- Sound design enhancing tension without overwhelming spoken text

## Rights

- India PD: Yes (author died 1961; PD year 2022)
- US PD: No (publication year 1932, possibly PD through renewal failure—requires verification)

## Digital Access
