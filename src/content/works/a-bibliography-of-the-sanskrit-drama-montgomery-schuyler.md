# A Bibliography of the Sanskrit Drama

## Overview

Published as Volume 3 of Columbia's Indo-Iranian Series, this bibliography catalogs over 500 Sanskrit dramatic works, expanding significantly beyond H.H. Wilson's 1827 listing of 60 plays and Sylvain Lévi's 1890 compilation of 372 titles. Schuyler provides an introductory survey of Sanskrit dramatic literature from its origins, examining dramatists including Kalidasa and Bhavabhuti, analyzing specific plays such as Shakuntala and Mricchakatika, and cataloging authors, titles, general critical works, Hindu treatises on dramatics, and translations. The bibliography established a comprehensive reference tool for Western Sanskrit drama scholarship in the early twentieth century.

## About Montgomery Schuyler Jr.

Montgomery Schuyler Jr. (1877-1955) was an American diplomat, banker, and orientalist who made significant contributions to Sanskrit studies. Educated at Columbia University (B.A. 1899, M.A. 1900), he combined diplomatic career (serving as U.S. Envoy to Ecuador in 1913 and El Salvador from 1921-1925) with scholarly pursuits in Indian literature and drama. His work on Sanskrit drama represents early American academic engagement with Indian classical literature.

## Historical Context

Published in 1906 by Columbia University Press as part of the Indo-Iranian Series edited by A.V. Williams Jackson, this bibliography appeared during a period of growing American academic interest in Sanskrit and Indian studies. The work built upon earlier European scholarship by Wilson and Lévi while significantly expanding the cataloged corpus of Sanskrit dramatic literature, reflecting increased access to manuscripts and improved bibliographic methods in early twentieth-century Indology.

## Academic Significance

This 140-page bibliography more than doubled Sylvain Lévi's 1890 catalog and represented nearly a tenfold increase over Wilson's earlier work. Schuyler's systematic organization of authors, titles, critical works, treatises on dramatics (including analysis of works like the Natyashastra), and translations provided Western scholars with an essential research tool. The introductory survey offered accessible orientation to Sanskrit dramatic literature for English-speaking academics and students.

## Content and Structure

The bibliography is organized into several sections:
- Introductory sketch of Sanskrit dramatic literature
- Names of dramatists and authors
- Alphabetical catalog of dramatic works
- General critical works on Sanskrit drama
- Hindu treatises on dramatic theory and practice
- Translations into European languages
- Analysis of major plays and playwrights

## Digital Preservation

Multiple sections of this work are available on English Wikisource, including the full introduction and catalogs. The complete 140-page text has been digitized from University of Toronto's Robarts Library collection and is freely accessible through the Internet Archive, ensuring continued availability to researchers and scholars of Sanskrit drama.
