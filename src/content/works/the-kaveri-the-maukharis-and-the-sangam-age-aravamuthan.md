  T. G. Aravamuthan's 131-page thesis (1925), awarded the Sankara-Parvati Prize by University of Madras, examines connections between ancient Tamil Sangam literature and North Indian political history. The work investigates references in classical Tamil poetry to the Maukhari dynasty and proposes controversial historical reconstructions of Tamil military expeditions to the Ganges valley. Combining literary analysis, numismatic evidence, and archaeological findings, Aravamuthan argues for direct interactions between Tamil kingdoms and North Indian dynasties, though his chronological proposals received scholarly skepticism and remain contested.

## About This Work

Aravamuthan's "The Kaveri, The Maukharis and The Sangam Age" (1925), awarded the Sankara-Parvati Prize for 1924 by the University of Madras and published by the university press, represents pioneering archaeological and numismatic scholarship examining connections between ancient Tamil literary traditions documented in Sangam poetry (circa 200 BCE-300 CE) and North Indian political history, specifically investigating references in classical Tamil literature to the Maukhari dynasty of Kanauj and proposing controversial historical reconstructions of Tamil military expeditions to the Ganges valley during the early Common Era. The 131-page thesis, produced by Aravamuthan (1890-1970)—an archaeologist and numismatist who would later gain prominence for excavations at Arikamedu, Brahmagiri, and other South Indian archaeological sites—deploys multidisciplinary methodology combining literary analysis of Sangam anthologies, numismatic evidence from coin finds, epigraphic interpretation of inscriptions, and comparative historical chronology to argue for direct political and military interactions between Tamil kingdoms (Chera, Chola, Pandya) and North Indian dynasties during periods conventionally understood as characterized by regional isolation. The work focuses particularly on the Kaveri river delta as heartland of Chola power centered at Kaveripattanam (ancient Puhar), examining how Sangam literature references to northern military campaigns, Himalayan expeditions, and interactions with Gangetic kingdoms might correspond to actual historical events rather than poetic fancy or legendary elaboration. Aravamuthan proposes identifying the "Moriyar" referenced in Sangam texts with the Mauryas, and more controversially, connecting references to northern conquests with the Maukhari dynasty of Kanauj (circa 6th-7th century CE), requiring significant chronological revision of conventional Sangam period dating—a proposal generating scholarly debate and general skepticism in subsequent historical research. The thesis exemplifies early twentieth-century Tamil historical scholarship's efforts to establish ancient Tamil civilization's political significance, military prowess, and cultural sophistication through systematic analysis of Sangam literary sources previously treated primarily as poetic texts rather than historical documents. This methodological approach reflected broader intellectual currents in colonial-era Tamil cultural nationalism seeking to demonstrate Dravidian civilizational achievements independent of and contemporaneous with North Indian Sanskrit-based cultures, countering both colonial historiography's marginalization of South Indian history and emerging pan-Indian nationalist narratives privileging North Indian Aryan-Vedic traditions. Aravamuthan's research drew on archaeological and numismatic evidence emerging from early twentieth-century systematic excavations and coin studies, attempting to correlate material culture findings with literary references to validate historical interpretations of Sangam texts. His identification of potential connections between Tamil kingdoms and North Indian dynasties participated in scholarly debates over ancient Tamil chronology, the historical reliability of Sangam literature, and the extent of political and cultural interactions between South and North India during the classical period. The work's controversial chronological proposals—particularly the Maukhari identification requiring dating certain Sangam references to 6th-7th century CE rather than the conventional earlier period—received critical scrutiny from reviewers in prestigious journals including the Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies and the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, who acknowledged Aravamuthan's scholarly rigor and innovative approach while questioning specific identifications and chronological frameworks. Modern Tamil historical scholarship generally does not accept Aravamuthan's Maukhari hypothesis, viewing it as forced correlation between disparate literary and historical evidence, though his broader methodological approach of integrating literary, archaeological, numismatic, and epigraphic sources influenced subsequent systematic study of ancient Tamil history. The thesis contributed to establishing archaeology and numismatics as essential disciplines for South Indian historical research, demonstrating how material culture evidence could inform and sometimes challenge literary source interpretations. Aravamuthan's subsequent career in archaeological research, including significant excavations at Roman trading sites in South India, validated his multidisciplinary approach while his later work focused more on material culture than literary-historical correlations. For scholars of Sangam literature and ancient Tamil history, the work represents an important moment in the development of critical historical methodology applied to Tamil classical sources, demonstrating both possibilities and limitations of correlating literary references with archaeological and political history. The thesis exemplifies early twentieth-century Tamil scholarship's negotiation between reverence for classical literary heritage and critical historical analysis, cultural pride in ancient Tamil achievements and rigorous evaluation of source reliability, and local Tamil identity assertion and participation in broader Indian historical narratives. The work's preservation through multiple digitizations (Digital Library of India, various Archive.org copies) reflects its recognition as significant historical document within Tamil intellectual history, even as its specific historical claims remain contested in contemporary scholarship.


## Scholarly Context and Tamil Historical Research

"The Kaveri, The Maukharis and The Sangam Age" emerged from early twentieth-century Tamil historical scholarship's systematic engagement with Sangam literature as historical source material, part of broader intellectual movements recovering and interpreting ancient Tamil cultural heritage during the colonial period. The University of Madras, established 1857 as one of India's first modern universities, served as institutional center for Tamil literary and historical research, sponsoring scholarship through prizes like the Sankara-Parvati Prize awarded to Aravamuthan's thesis in 1924. This institutional support reflected growing recognition of Tamil classical literature's significance and the need for rigorous historical methodology analyzing ancient texts through archaeological, numismatic, and comparative evidence.

Aravamuthan's work participated in contemporary scholarly debates over Sangam literature's dating, historical reliability, and interpretation. Earlier Tamil scholars including U. V. Swaminatha Iyer (who discovered and published key Sangam manuscripts in the late nineteenth century) had focused primarily on textual recovery and literary appreciation; Aravamuthan's generation applied modern historical methods—archaeological excavation, coin analysis, epigraphic study, comparative chronology—to establish factual foundations for understanding the Sangam period's political, economic, and social organization.

The thesis addressed specific historical questions about contacts between Tamil kingdoms and North India. Sangam poetry contains references to Tamil kings conducting northern military campaigns, Himalayan expeditions, and interactions with Gangetic valley powers, raising questions about whether these represented actual historical events, legendary elaborations, or poetic conventions. Aravamuthan's controversial proposal identifying textual references with the Maukhari dynasty required significant chronological revision, as conventional Sangam dating (circa 200 BCE-300 CE) preceded the Maukharis (6th-7th century CE) by several centuries.

## Methodology and Arguments

The thesis integrates multiple source categories to reconstruct historical connections: Sangam literary references to northern campaigns and Gangetic interactions; numismatic evidence from coin finds suggesting trade and political contacts; epigraphic sources documenting dynastic names and political relationships; and archaeological evidence for material culture exchanges. Aravamuthan examines specific Sangam passages mentioning "Moriyar" (proposed Maurya identification), northern expeditions by Chola kings, and references to Himalayan regions, attempting to correlate these with known North Indian political history and archaeological evidence.

The work analyzes the Kaveri delta's role as Chola political and economic heartland, examining how agricultural prosperity from Kaveri irrigation supported Chola military expansion and cultural flourishing documented in Sangam literature. The study considers Kaveripattanam (Puhar) as major port facilitating maritime trade with Rome, Southeast Asia, and other regions, potentially explaining Tamil kingdoms' wealth and political ambitions extending beyond South India.

Aravamuthan's numismatic expertise informed analysis of coin evidence for inter-regional contacts, examining how coin finds might document political relationships, trade networks, or military expeditions mentioned in literary sources. His archaeological training shaped methodological approaches prioritizing material culture evidence alongside textual analysis, contrasting with purely literary or philological scholarship dominating earlier Sangam studies.

## Scholarly Reception and Legacy

Contemporary reviews in major Indological journals acknowledged Aravamuthan's innovative multidisciplinary approach while expressing skepticism about specific historical identifications, particularly the Maukhari correlation requiring problematic chronological adjustments. Subsequent Tamil historical scholarship has generally rejected the Maukhari hypothesis while appreciating Aravamuthan's methodological integration of diverse source types and his efforts to establish rigorous historical foundations for interpreting Sangam literary references.

The work influenced development of Tamil historical archaeology and numismatics as disciplines, demonstrating how material culture studies could inform literary source interpretation. Aravamuthan's later career, including significant excavations at Arikamedu (Roman trading site) and other locations, validated multidisciplinary approaches combining textual and archaeological evidence for reconstructing ancient Tamil history and South India's connections to broader Indian Ocean commercial and cultural networks.

Modern scholarship on Sangam literature and ancient Tamil history engages critically with Aravamuthan's work, recognizing its pioneering integration of archaeological and literary sources while noting methodological limitations and questionable historical claims. The thesis remains valuable for historians examining early twentieth-century Tamil scholarly efforts to establish ancient Tamil civilization's significance and for understanding the development of critical historical methodology applied to classical Tamil literary sources.
