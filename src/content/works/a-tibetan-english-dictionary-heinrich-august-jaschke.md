# A Tibetan-English Dictionary

## Overview
Compiled during Jäschke’s decades in Ladakh and Kyelang, this dictionary emphasises the vernacular speech of Central Tibet while noting dialectal variants from Amdo and Kham. Entries supply transliteration, literal meaning, and idiomatic usage, reflecting the author’s collaboration with Tibetan scholars at the British colonial frontier.

## Highlights
Jäschke includes extensive religious terminology drawn from Buddhist scriptures, grammatical notes on honorific forms, and scientific vocabulary coined for missionary and educational work. The concluding English–Tibetan index aids reverse lookup, serving administrators, explorers, and monks engaged in translation.

## Access Notes
The Internet Archive scan preserves diacritics and the original typography commissioned by the India Office Press, with OCR that facilitates searching for Tibetan syllables and Sanskrit loanwords.
