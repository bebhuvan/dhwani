  The Buddhacharita (Acts of the Buddha) represents a pivotal literary achievement in early classical Sanskrit literature, emerging during the critical Kushan period when Buddhism experienced profound intellectual and cultural transformation across North India. Composed by Aśvaghoṣa, a sophisticated scholar-poet associated with the Mahayana Buddhist intellectual tradition, this epic mahakavya illuminates the life trajectory of Gautama Buddha through exquisite poetic narrative. Written in the 2nd century CE, likely during King Kanishka's reign (c. 127-151 CE), the work demonstrates remarkable sophistication in synthesizing philosophical discourse with intricate literary technique. Originally spanning 28 cantos, only the first 14 survive in the original Sanskrit, with complete versions preserved through Chinese and Tibetan translations. Aśvaghoṣa's nuanced portrayal transcends hagiographic conventions, presenting Buddha's spiritual journey with psychological complexity and profound philosophical insight. The text explores themes of renunciation, spiritual transformation, and the universal human quest for understanding, reflecting broader Buddhist contemplative traditions while maintaining sophisticated aesthetic standards of classical Sanskrit literature. Critically, the Buddhacharita represents a landmark moment in Indian intellectual history, bridging religious narrative, philosophical exploration, and refined literary expression. Its significance extends beyond religious biography, offering a sophisticated meditation on human consciousness, societal structures, and individual spiritual potential. As a literary monument, it exemplifies the remarkable intellectual dynamism of early Indian Buddhist scholarly traditions, demonstrating how complex philosophical ideas could be communicated through elegant, accessible poetic form.

# The Buddhacharita (Life of Buddha)

## Overview

The *Buddhacharita* ("Acts of the Buddha") stands as one of the earliest complete biographies of Gautama Buddha and a masterpiece of Sanskrit kavya (court poetry). Composed by Aśvaghoṣa in the 2nd century CE, this epic poem presents the Buddha's life from birth through enlightenment using the sophisticated literary conventions of classical Sanskrit mahakavya. E.B. Cowell's 1893-94 translation for Oxford's *Sacred Books of the East* series made this foundational Buddhist biographical text accessible to Western scholarship.

## The Poet: Aśvaghoṣa

Aśvaghoṣa (c. 80-150 CE) was a Buddhist philosopher, poet, and dramatist whose literary and intellectual contributions profoundly shaped Mahayana Buddhism:
