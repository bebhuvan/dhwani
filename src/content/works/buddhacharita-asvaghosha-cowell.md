# The Buddhacharita (Life of Buddha)

## Overview

The *Buddhacharita* ("Acts of the Buddha") stands as one of the earliest complete biographies of Gautama Buddha and a masterpiece of Sanskrit kavya (court poetry). Composed by Aśvaghoṣa in the 2nd century CE, this epic poem presents the Buddha's life from birth through enlightenment using the sophisticated literary conventions of classical Sanskrit mahakavya. E.B. Cowell's 1893-94 translation for Oxford's *Sacred Books of the East* series made this foundational Buddhist biographical text accessible to Western scholarship.

## The Poet: Aśvaghoṣa

Aśvaghoṣa (c. 80-150 CE) was a Buddhist philosopher, poet, and dramatist whose literary and intellectual contributions profoundly shaped Mahayana Buddhism:

### Historical Context

**Time Period:** Flourished during the Kushan Empire, likely under King Kanishka I

**Place:** Associated with Saketa (modern Ayodhya) and the Kushan capital

**Religious Affiliation:** Buddhist, though well-versed in Brahmanical literature

**Philosophical School:** Contributed to early Mahayana and Yogacara thought

### Literary Achievement

**Greatest Pre-Kalidasa Poet:** Considered the finest Sanskrit poet before Kalidasa (4th-5th century)

**First Sanskrit Dramatist:** Credited with *Śāriputraprakaraṇa*, earliest known Sanskrit drama

**Philosophical Works:** *Mahāyāna-śraddhotpāda-śāstra* (though Aśvaghoṣa's authorship debated)

**Literary Innovation:** Combined Buddhist content with classical Sanskrit literary forms

### Significance

Aśvaghoṣa demonstrated that Buddhist themes could be expressed through the highest Sanskrit literary forms, previously dominated by Brahmanical subjects. This cultural synthesis enabled Buddhism's appeal to Sanskrit-educated elites.

## Literary Characteristics

### Mahakavya Conventions

The *Buddhacharita* employs classical Sanskrit epic conventions:

**Natural Descriptions:** Elaborate depictions of seasons, gardens, cities

**Varied Meters:** Different metrical patterns for different moods and situations

**Purva-ranga:** Invocatory opening establishing the work's purpose

**Poetic Diction:** Sophisticated vocabulary and complex compounds

### Restraint in Miracles

Unlike later Buddhist hagiographies, Aśvaghoṣa exercises relative restraint:

**Psychological Realism:** Emphasis on Buddha's human struggles and psychological development

**Natural Causation:** Events generally follow natural laws, though with supernatural elements

**Philosophical Depth:** Focus on Buddha's intellectual and spiritual journey

**Measured Supernatural:** Miracles present but not overwhelming the narrative

This restraint makes the Buddha more accessible as a human exemplar while maintaining his extraordinary nature.

### Poetic Excellence

**Philosophical Integration:** Complex Buddhist teachings woven into narrative

**Dramatic Scenes:** Effective use of dialogue and dramatic tension

## Philosophical Themes

### Suffering (Dukkha)

The four encounters crystallize Buddhism's first noble truth:

**Universality:** All beings subject to aging, sickness, death

**Inescapability:** Wealth and pleasure cannot prevent suffering

**Motivation:** Recognition of suffering motivates spiritual seeking

### Renunciation

**Radical Break:** Leaving behind family, wealth, status

**Necessity:** Liberation requires detachment from worldly life

**Non-Extremism:** Middle way between luxury and self-torture

**Inner vs. Outer:** True renunciation is mental, not merely physical

### Dependent Origination

**Causation:** All phenomena arise through causes and conditions

**Twelve Links:** Chain of causation explaining samsaric existence

**Breaking the Chain:** Liberation through understanding and eliminating ignorance

### Four Noble Truths

**Suffering's Reality:** Acknowledging life's unsatisfactory nature

**Origin in Craving:** Attachment and desire as suffering's cause

**Cessation Possible:** Nirvana as suffering's end
