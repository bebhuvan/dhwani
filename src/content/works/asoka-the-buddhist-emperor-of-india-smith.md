# Asoka, the Buddhist Emperor of India

## Overview

Published in 1920, Vincent Arthur Smith's biography of Ashoka (also spelled Asoka) represents the first comprehensive English study of ancient India's most celebrated ruler. Smith reconstructed Ashoka's reign (approximately 268-232 BCE) primarily from the emperor's own words—edicts carved on stone pillars and rock faces across the vast Mauryan Empire, from Afghanistan to southern India.

These inscriptions, deciphered in the 19th century by James Prinsep and others, revealed an emperor who renounced military conquest after the horrific Kalinga War, converted to Buddhism, and devoted his reign to promoting dharma (moral law, righteous living). Ashoka's edicts proclaim religious tolerance, social welfare, humane governance, and moral instruction—radical principles that made him one of history's most admired rulers and Buddhism's most important royal patron.

Smith's biography established the scholarly framework for understanding Ashoka, though subsequent archaeology and epigraphy have refined and corrected details. The book remains essential for its comprehensive synthesis of epigraphic evidence and its influence on how modern India views this ancient emperor who rejected conquest for ethical governance.

## About Vincent Arthur Smith (1848-1920)

As detailed in Smith's other works in this collection (including his *Oxford History of India* and *Akbar the Great Mogul*), Smith served in the Indian Civil Service before becoming independent scholar specializing in Indian history, archaeology, and numismatics. His *Early History of India* (1904) established chronology for ancient Indian dynasties through careful correlation of Greek sources, inscriptions, coins, and Buddhist/Jain texts.

Smith brought administrative mindset to historical scholarship—interest in governance structures, economic policy, and political institutions. His biography of Ashoka analyzes imperial administration, revenue systems, diplomatic relations, and law enforcement alongside the emperor's religious and moral philosophy. This administrative perspective distinguished his work from purely religious or philosophical approaches.

His 1920 death shortly after this book's publication marked the end of an era in British Indian historical scholarship. Smith represented the last generation of scholar-administrators who combined government service with serious academic research, before professional university-based historians took over Indian historical studies.

## Ashoka's Reign and Edicts

The Mauryan Empire, established by Chandragupta Maurya and expanded by his son Bindusara, reached its zenith under Ashoka. Controlling most of the Indian subcontinent except the far south, the empire required sophisticated administration, which Ashoka inherited and reformed according to Buddhist principles.

**The Kalinga War**: Early in his reign, Ashoka conquered Kalinga (modern Odisha), a wealthy maritime kingdom. The war's brutality—Rock Edict XIII describes 100,000 killed, 150,000 deported—horrified the emperor. His inscriptions record deep remorse and resolve to abandon conquest for dharma-vijaya (victory through moral law). This transformation from violent conqueror to peaceful Buddhist monarch became central to Ashoka's historical image.

**Buddhist Conversion**: While Smith accepted Buddhist tradition of Ashoka's dramatic conversion, he carefully distinguished verifiable historical facts from hagiographic legend. The edicts confirm royal patronage of Buddhism—pilgrimages to Buddhist sites, missionary efforts, support for monastic communities—but also show Ashoka promoting general ethical principles transcending sectarian Buddhism.

**Dharma Edicts**: Inscribed throughout the empire in Prakrit languages (using Brahmi and Kharosthi scripts, plus Greek and Aramaic in northwestern regions), the edicts proclaim moral teachings: non-violence, truthfulness, respect for parents and teachers, generosity to priests and ascetics, religious tolerance. Ashoka appointed dharma-mahamatras (morality officers) to supervise welfare projects, inspect prisons, and resolve disputes. He regulated animal slaughter, established hospitals, planted trees along roads, and dug wells—practical expressions of Buddhist compassion.

**Buddhist Missions**: The edicts describe missions to Hellenistic kingdoms (Antiochus II of Syria, Ptolemy II of Egypt, Antigonus of Macedonia, Magas of Cyrene, Alexander of Epirus) and Southeast Asian regions. While Smith questioned whether formal diplomatic missions occurred, Buddhist tradition credits Ashoka with spreading Buddhism to Sri Lanka (through his son Mahinda), Myanmar, and beyond—the foundation for Buddhism's transformation into pan-Asian religion.

## Historical Reconstruction and Sources

Smith's challenge was reconstructing biography from fragmentary epigraphic sources. Unlike Akbar with abundant Persian chronicles, Ashoka left only inscriptions—proclamations, not narrative history. Buddhist texts like the *Ashokavadana* and Ceylonese *Mahavamsa* chronicle provided narrative but mixed history with legend, written centuries after events.

Smith carefully distinguished reliable epigraphy from later hagiography. He accepted edicts' testimony about Ashoka's policies and ideals but questioned Buddhist legends of miraculous deeds and numbers (84,000 stupas built, etc.). This source-critical approach established scholarly method for early Indian history where textual and material sources required careful correlation.

Archaeological evidence—Mauryan-period stupas, pillars with characteristic polish, palace remains at Pataliputra—corroborated inscriptions. Numismatic evidence (punch-marked coins) illuminated Mauryan economy. Smith synthesized these sources into coherent historical narrative, acknowledging uncertainties and gaps.

## Ashoka's Legacy

Smith recognized Ashoka's unique historical position—an emperor who rejected militarism for moral governance, embodying Buddhist ideals of compassionate rule. The contrast with contemporary rulers (Alexander's successors fighting endless wars) and later Indian dynasties made Ashoka exceptional.

Yet Smith avoided romantic idealization. He noted contradictions: Ashoka maintained vast military and police apparatus; capital punishment continued; the empire's administrative control required coercion; religious tolerance didn't extend to political dissent. The emperor promoted welfare while sustaining authoritarian imperial structures.

For modern India, Ashoka became national symbol—his Sarnath Lion Capital adopted as India's national emblem, his dharma-chakra (wheel of law) placed on the flag. Jawaharlal Nehru and others invoked Ashoka's ethical governance and religious tolerance as ideals for independent India. Smith's biography helped establish this modern reverence by documenting the emperor's genuine moral vision.

For Buddhist history, Ashoka's patronage transformed regional Indian religion into missionary faith spreading across Asia. His support for monastic communities, sponsorship of Buddhist councils, and propagation of dharma fundamentally shaped Buddhism's development.

## Critical Perspective

Modern scholars correct Smith's errors: revised chronology, better understanding of Mauryan administration, recognition that "dharma" meant broader ethical conduct than sectarian Buddhism, awareness that edicts represented idealized self-presentation rather than objective policy description.

Yet Smith's fundamental achievement endures: establishing Ashoka's historical significance, demonstrating how epigraphic sources could reconstruct ancient Indian history, and recognizing the emperor's exceptional moral vision—however imperfectly realized in practice.

## This Digital Edition

This Internet Archive preservation provides access to foundational biography of ancient India's most celebrated ruler. While superseded in details by later scholarship, Smith's work remains essential for understanding how modern historical knowledge of Ashoka emerged from 19th-century decipherment of ancient inscriptions and how this emperor became icon of Buddhist compassion and moral governance.
