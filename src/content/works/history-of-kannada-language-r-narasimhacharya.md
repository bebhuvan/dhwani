  R. Narasimhacharya's History of Kannada Language, published by the University of Mysore in 1934, represents a foundational scholarly work in Kannada linguistic historiography and Dravidian language studies. Based on a series of five public lectures delivered at the University of Mysore between late 1926 and early 1927, this monograph systematically examines the classification, antiquity, lexical characteristics, grammatical structures, and historical development of Kannada from its earliest documented forms through the modern period. Written by one of the preeminent Kannada scholars of the early twentieth century—a pioneer who earned the first Master's degree in Kannada from Madras University in 1893 and spent over four decades researching Karnataka's archaeological, epigraphical, and literary heritage—the work synthesizes epigraphical evidence, textual analysis, and comparative Dravidian linguistics to trace Kannada's evolution across approximately fifteen centuries. Narasimhacharya addresses critical questions about the Dravidian language family's distinctiveness from Sanskrit and other Indo-Aryan languages, establishes the antiquity of the name "Kannada" through inscriptional and literary sources, analyzes lexical affinities between Kannada and other Dravidian languages while examining Sanskrit loan-word strata, and discusses morphological and syntactic features distinguishing Old, Middle, and Modern Kannada. The lectures appeared during a significant moment in Indian linguistic scholarship, when regional-language studies were establishing themselves as rigorous academic disciplines distinct from colonial-era Sanskrit-centric philology, and when questions of linguistic identity intersected with emerging cultural-nationalist movements. As a comprehensive English-language synthesis of Kannada linguistic history accessible to both specialists and educated general readers, the work served to establish Kannada studies within broader comparative-linguistic frameworks while simultaneously asserting Kannada's antiquity, literary sophistication, and autonomous developmental trajectory. The text remains valuable for historians of Dravidian linguistics, scholars examining early twentieth-century approaches to regional-language historiography, and researchers investigating the intellectual traditions through which modern Karnataka's cultural self-understanding was constructed during the late colonial and early independence periods.

# History of Kannada Language

## Overview

R. Narasimhacharya's *History of Kannada Language*, published by the University of Mysore in 1934, stands as a pioneering scholarly synthesis of Kannada linguistic historiography during the formative period of modern Indian regional-language studies. Originally delivered as five public lectures at the University of Mysore during late 1926 and early 1927, the work represents the culmination of decades of research by one of early twentieth-century Karnataka's most distinguished scholars. The lectures systematically examine Kannada's classification within the Dravidian language family, establish the antiquity of Kannada through epigraphical and literary evidence, analyze lexical relationships between Kannada and related languages, discuss grammatical structures and their evolution, and trace the language's development from its earliest documented forms through the modern period.

The work appeared during a significant transition in South Asian linguistic scholarship. Colonial-era philology, dominated by Sanskrit studies and oriented toward Indo-European comparative linguistics, had largely marginalized Dravidian languages as subjects of serious academic inquiry. By the early twentieth century, however, scholars like Caldwell, Kittel, and Indian researchers were establishing Dravidian linguistics as a rigorous field demonstrating these languages' antiquity, sophistication, and independent developmental trajectories. Narasimhacharya's lectures contributed to this intellectual movement, providing an accessible English-language synthesis that situated Kannada within comparative-linguistic frameworks while asserting its distinctive historical and cultural significance.

The approximately 183-page monograph combines epigraphical analysis—drawing on Narasimhacharya's extensive fieldwork documenting Karnataka's inscriptions—with examination of classical Kannada literary texts and comparative study of Dravidian linguistic features. His approach reflects the interdisciplinary character of early regional-language scholarship, where linguistic analysis intersected with archaeology, epigraphy, literary history, and cultural studies. The work addresses both specialist concerns and broader questions of regional identity during a period when linguistic-cultural nationalism was emerging as a significant force in Indian public life.

## About the Author

Rao Bahadur R. Narasimhacharya (1860-1936), honored with the titles Praktana Vimarsha Vichakshana, Prachyavidyavaibhava, and Mahamahopadhyaya, exemplified the scholarly polymath of late colonial and early twentieth-century Karnataka. Born in Srirangapattana in 1860, he pursued higher education during a period when modern university education was establishing itself in South India. In 1882, he earned his Bachelor of Arts degree, and in 1893 achieved the historic distinction of becoming the first person to earn a Master's degree in Kannada from Madras University—a milestone signifying both Kannada's emerging academic legitimacy and Narasimhacharya's pioneering role in its institutionalization as a subject of university study.

His professional career combined teaching with research and administrative responsibilities. After several years as a high school teacher, he was appointed lecturer at Maharaja's College, Mysore, where he influenced multiple generations of students. Concurrently, he served in Karnataka's archaeology department, first as assistant to B.L. Rice and subsequently as director. During over two decades of archaeological fieldwork, he systematically surveyed the former Mysore princely state, discovering and documenting approximately 5,000 previously unknown inscriptions and studying more than 1,000 temples. This extensive epigraphical research provided the evidential foundation for his linguistic and historical work, enabling him to trace Kannada's development through inscriptional evidence spanning centuries.

Narasimhacharya's scholarly output demonstrated remarkable range and productivity. His magnum opus, *Karnataka Kavicharite* (History of Karnataka Poets), appeared in three substantial volumes published in 1907, 1919, and 1929 respectively, establishing itself as a foundational reference for Kannada literary history. He produced critical editions of classical Kannada texts, including studies of Nagavarma's *Kavyavalokanam* and *Karnatakabhashabhushanam*, important works on Kannada poetics and grammar. His epigraphical research resulted in numerous publications documenting inscriptions and analyzing their historical and linguistic significance. In art history, he made the important scholarly contribution of establishing Hoysala sculpture as a distinct artistic tradition separate from Chalukya sculpture, demonstrating his expertise beyond purely linguistic and literary domains.

His scholarly achievements earned multiple honors during his lifetime. He received the title Rao Bahadur from the British colonial administration, was made an honorary member of the prestigious Royal Asiatic Society in 1907, and presided over the fourth Kannada Sahitya Sammelana (Kannada Literary Conference) at Dharwad in 1918. He retired from his archaeological position in 1922, but continued scholarly work until his death in 1936. His legacy includes not only his published works but his role in establishing the institutional and methodological foundations for modern Kannada studies, training subsequent generations of scholars, and demonstrating the intellectual legitimacy and cultural importance of regional-language scholarship.

## The Work: Structure and Contents

*History of Kannada Language* systematically examines multiple dimensions of Kannada linguistic history across its five constituent lectures. Though specific chapter details vary between editions, the work's major thematic concerns can be identified from contemporary descriptions and scholarly references.

**Classification and Dravidian Identity**: The opening sections address Kannada's classification within the Dravidian language family and its distinctiveness from Sanskrit and Indo-Aryan languages. This discussion engaged with ongoing scholarly debates about linguistic relationships, responding to earlier assumptions that had sometimes treated Dravidian languages as corrupted or derivative forms of Sanskrit. Narasimhacharya marshals comparative evidence demonstrating Dravidian languages' independent status, distinct grammatical structures, and autonomous developmental histories. He situates Kannada within the Dravidian family alongside Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, and other related languages, analyzing shared features and distinctive characteristics.

**Antiquity and Historical Documentation**: A central concern addresses the antiquity of the name "Kannada" and the language's documented history. Drawing extensively on his epigraphical expertise, Narasimhacharya examines inscriptional evidence for Kannada from the earliest known records—including the famous Halmidi inscription dated to approximately 450 CE—through medieval inscriptions documenting the language's evolution. He analyzes references to Kannada in Sanskrit and other literary sources, establishing a chronology of attestation and discussing the language's geographic spread and administrative usage across different periods. This section demonstrates how epigraphical analysis serves linguistic history, with inscriptions providing direct evidence of earlier language stages impossible to reconstruct from later literary sources alone.

**Lexical Affinities and Borrowing**: The lectures examine Kannada's vocabulary from multiple perspectives. They analyze lexical relationships between Kannada and other Dravidian languages, identifying shared roots and cognates that demonstrate common ancestry while noting distinctive Kannada developments. Simultaneously, Narasimhacharya addresses Sanskrit's profound influence on Kannada lexicon, analyzing patterns and chronology of Sanskrit loan-words. His treatment likely distinguishes between earlier and later borrowing strata, technical and everyday vocabulary, and discusses how Kannada incorporated Sanskrit elements while maintaining its Dravidian grammatical foundation—a phenomenon characteristic of South Indian linguistic history where Dravidian and Sanskrit coexisted and influenced each other over centuries.

**Grammatical Structure and Evolution**: The work provides substantial analysis of Kannada grammar—morphology, syntax, verb systems, and other structural features. Narasimhacharya discusses how Kannada grammar demonstrates Dravidian characteristics: agglutinative morphology, postpositions rather than prepositions, subject-object-verb word order, and other features distinguishing Dravidian from Indo-Aryan structures. The lectures likely address grammatical changes across Kannada's historical periods, tracing developments from Old Kannada (approximately 450-1200 CE) through Middle Kannada (1200-1700 CE) to Modern Kannada forms, using literary and inscriptional evidence to document linguistic evolution.

**Historical Periods and Development**: Throughout the lectures, Narasimhacharya employs periodization dividing Kannada into historical stages. This tripartite division—Old, Middle, and Modern Kannada—has become standard in subsequent Kannada linguistic scholarship. He discusses each period's characteristics, major literary works, linguistic innovations, and broader cultural-historical contexts, providing a synthetic account linking linguistic change to Karnataka's political, social, and cultural history.

## Historical and Scholarly Context

The publication of *History of Kannada Language* in 1934 situated the work within multiple intersecting contexts—intellectual, cultural, and political—that shaped both its content and its reception.

**Development of Dravidian Linguistics**: By the early twentieth century, Dravidian linguistics had evolved from marginal colonial curiosity to established academic field. Robert Caldwell's groundbreaking *Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian or South-Indian Family of Languages* (1856) had demonstrated the Dravidian family's independence from Sanskrit and its internal coherence. Subsequent scholars including F. Kittel (whose massive Kannada-English dictionary appeared 1894) and European and Indian researchers had expanded knowledge of individual Dravidian languages and refined comparative methods. Narasimhacharya's work both drew upon and contributed to this scholarly tradition, applying comparative-linguistic frameworks to Kannada's specific history while grounding analysis in indigenous textual and epigraphical traditions.

**Regional Cultural Movements**: The lectures appeared during Karnataka's cultural renaissance—a period of renewed interest in Kannada language, literature, and cultural heritage often associated with the Navodaya (renaissance) literary movement. Institutions like the Kannada Sahitya Parishat (founded 1915) promoted Kannada literary culture, organized conferences, and fostered scholarly research. Narasimhacharya's leadership role—he presided over the 1918 Kannada Sahitya Sammelana—placed him at this movement's center. His scholarly work simultaneously served academic purposes and cultural-nationalist objectives, demonstrating Kannada's antiquity and sophistication to both scholarly audiences and educated Kannada-speaking public.

**Linguistic Politics and Identity**: The 1920s-1930s saw increasing political significance attached to language questions in India. Debates about national language, regional linguistic identities, and education policy made linguistic scholarship politically relevant. For Kannada speakers, establishing their language's antiquity, literary tradition, and distinct identity had implications for cultural status and potentially for political questions about regional boundaries and administrative arrangements. Narasimhacharya's systematic historical account provided intellectual resources for these broader cultural-political concerns, though his scholarly approach maintained academic rigor rather than explicitly polemical character.

**University Institutionalization**: The University of Mysore's publication of these lectures reflected the growing institutionalization of regional-language studies within Indian universities. The Mysore princely state, under relatively enlightened rule, had invested in educational and cultural institutions. The University of Mysore, established 1916, created infrastructure for advanced research and teaching in Kannada alongside other subjects. Narasimhacharya's lectures, delivered under university auspices and published by the university press, exemplified this institutional commitment to regional scholarship. The work's English-language presentation enabled it to reach scholarly audiences beyond Kannada speakers while maintaining accessibility for educated Karnataka readers.

## Methodology and Approach

Narasimhacharya's methodological approach reflects the interdisciplinary character of early twentieth-century regional scholarship, combining multiple evidentiary sources and analytical frameworks.

His extensive epigraphical research provided primary source material impossible for scholars lacking similar field experience. Kannada inscriptions, spanning from the fifth century CE through medieval periods, documented the language at various historical stages, showing phonological, morphological, lexical, and orthographic changes over time. Unlike literary texts—often preserved through manuscript traditions involving copying, editorial intervention, and potential modernization—inscriptions preserve language at specific moments, enabling precise linguistic analysis. Narasimhacharya's documentation of thousands of inscriptions gave him unparalleled access to this evidence, which he systematically analyzed for linguistic-historical purposes.

Complementing epigraphical evidence, he examined classical Kannada literary works—poetry, prose, and technical literature spanning centuries. These texts demonstrated literary language registers, stylistic conventions, and vocabulary ranges different from inscriptional administrative language, providing fuller pictures of historical Kannada than either source alone could offer. His literary-historical expertise, demonstrated in *Karnataka Kavicharite*, enabled sophisticated textual analysis connecting literary production to linguistic development.

His comparative approach situated Kannada within Dravidian linguistic family, analyzing similarities and differences with Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and other related languages. This comparative framework enabled him to distinguish features shared through common ancestry from later innovations, to hypothesize about proto-Dravidian forms and their evolution in different languages, and to understand Kannada's specific developmental trajectory within broader linguistic family patterns.

Simultaneously, he addressed Sanskrit-Kannada interactions, analyzing patterns of Sanskrit loan-word incorporation, bilingual literary traditions, and grammatical influences while maintaining clear analytical distinction between Kannada's Dravidian foundation and Sanskrit overlay. This balanced treatment avoided both exaggerating Sanskrit influence and minimizing its real significance in Kannada's historical development.

## Legacy and Contemporary Significance

*History of Kannada Language* exercised substantial influence on subsequent Kannada linguistic scholarship. As the first systematic English-language synthesis of Kannada linguistic history, it established frameworks, posed questions, and identified evidence that shaped later research. The tripartite historical periodization (Old, Middle, Modern Kannada) became standard in subsequent scholarship. The emphasis on epigraphical evidence for linguistic history influenced methodological approaches in Dravidian historical linguistics. The systematic treatment of classification, lexicon, and grammar provided models for similar works on other regional languages.

For Kannada cultural and intellectual history, Narasimhacharya's broader scholarly legacy—of which *History of Kannada Language* forms one important component—proved foundational. His role in establishing Kannada studies as rigorous academic discipline, his training of subsequent scholars, his institutional leadership, and his prolific research output across epigraphy, literary history, linguistics, and archaeology created infrastructure and intellectual resources that enabled Karnataka's twentieth-century cultural development. The institutions, methods, and knowledge he helped establish continue shaping how Karnataka understands its linguistic and cultural heritage.

For contemporary scholars, the work retains multiple forms of value. As historical document, it reveals early twentieth-century approaches to regional-language historiography, showing how linguistic scholarship intersected with cultural nationalism, colonial knowledge systems, and emerging Indian academic institutions. As scholarly synthesis, it preserves knowledge of sources and arguments that shaped modern Kannada studies. As linguistic analysis, it contains data and observations from Narasimhacharya's unique epigraphical research that remain relevant for historical linguistics. The work thus serves simultaneously as primary source for intellectual history and as secondary source for linguistic history.

The text's digitization and online availability through Archive.org facilitates contemporary access that was impossible when it existed only as physical copies in specialized libraries. Researchers worldwide can now engage with this foundational text, enabling new scholarly work, comparative studies across regional-language historiographies, and broader accessibility for general readers interested in Kannada linguistic and cultural history.

## Kannada's Subsequent Recognition

Developments following the work's 1934 publication vindicated and extended Narasimhacharya's arguments about Kannada's antiquity and cultural significance. In 2008, the Government of India granted Kannada official recognition as a Classical Language of India, joining Tamil, Sanskrit, and Telugu in receiving this designation. This recognition, based on criteria including high antiquity of early texts and recorded history over 1500-2000 years, formalized governmental acknowledgment of claims that scholars like Narasimhacharya had long advanced through scholarly research. The classical language status carries not only cultural prestige but also practical implications for government support of linguistic research, education, and preservation.

Ongoing archaeological discoveries and epigraphical research continue refining understanding of Kannada's historical development. The Halmidi inscription, dated to approximately 450 CE and discussed by Narasimhacharya among other early sources, remains the earliest known Kannada inscription, though ongoing research continually adds to the corpus of documented texts. Modern linguistic scholarship employs methodologies and theoretical frameworks unavailable in Narasimhacharya's time—including formal computational approaches, refined comparative-historical methods, and sociolinguistic analysis—yet builds upon the evidential and conceptual foundations that early scholars like Narasimhacharya established.
