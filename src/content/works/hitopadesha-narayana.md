description: "Narayana Pandita's Hitopadesha represents medieval India's most popular fable collection, adapted from the ancient Panchatantra while incorporating additional sources and reorganizing content for clearer pedagogical presentation. Composed in 12th-century Bengal, this work comprises four books—Mitralabha (Gaining Friends), Suhridbheda (Loss of Friends), Vigraha (War), and Sandhi (Peace)—containing animal fables, human stories, and practical wisdom aimed at educating princes in niti (statecraft and ethics). Unlike the Panchatantra's complex nested narratives, the Hitopadesha employs simpler framing with frequent verse maxims (subhashitas) extracting moral lessons, making it ideal for Sanskrit language instruction. The work's influence extended globally through translations into Persian, Arabic, and European languages, while its accessible Sanskrit style made it a standard text for learning the language. F. Max Müller's edition and numerous later translations established the Hitopadesha as introduction to Sanskrit literature for generations of students worldwide."
