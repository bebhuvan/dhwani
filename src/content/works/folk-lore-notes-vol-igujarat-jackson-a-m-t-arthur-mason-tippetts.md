  Folk Lore Notes. Vol. I—Gujarat represents a critical ethnographic documentation of Gujarati folk traditions during the late 19th century, compiled during a pivotal period of colonial scholarly engagement with indigenous cultural knowledge. Arthur Mason Tippetts Jackson, a British colonial administrator and ethnographer serving in the Bombay Presidency, meticulously collected and preserved intricate details of local beliefs, ritualistic practices, mythological narratives, and localized religious traditions that might otherwise have been marginalized or lost during rapid sociocultural transformations of the colonial era. The work provides an invaluable anthropological lens into the complex religious and cultural landscape of Gujarat, documenting diverse folk deities, community-specific ritual practices, oral narratives, and indigenous belief systems that formed the intricate social fabric of rural Gujarati communities during the late 19th century. Jackson's scholarly approach reflects the emerging anthropological methodologies of his time, characterized by systematic documentation and comparative analysis of cultural practices. Beyond its historical significance, the text serves as a critical primary source for understanding the nuanced cultural expressions of Gujarati society, offering contemporary scholars insights into social structures, religious syncretism, and the dynamic nature of folk traditions during a period of significant cultural transition. By capturing these cultural expressions with scholarly rigor, Jackson's work contributes substantially to the broader understanding of Indian regional cultural heritage, providing a detailed ethnographic record that bridges indigenous knowledge systems with emerging colonial-era scholarly practices. This volume remains a significant reference for researchers in anthropology, folklore studies, and Indian cultural history, preserving a complex cultural landscape at a moment of profound social change.

# Folk Lore Notes. Vol. I—Gujarat

## Overview

"Folk Lore Notes. Vol. I—Gujarat" by A. M. T. Jackson is a collection of folkloric materials compiled in the early 20th century. The book focuses on the beliefs, practices, and rituals of the people in Gujarat, highlighting themes of local deities, nature powers, and various customs that comprise the rich tapestry of Indian folklore. It serves both as an exploration of rural traditions and as a tribute to Jackson, who collected these insights during his lifetime.

## Collection Methodology

The work details the context of its compilation, emphasizing the importance of recording rapidly changing folk traditions in Western India around the turn of the century. Jackson's inquiry into local beliefs employed a questionnaire distributed among schoolmasters, aimed at capturing the essence of spiritual and cultural practices. R. E. Enthoven, who published these notes posthumously, reflects on their significance as documents revealing knowledge about the worship of spirits, minor deities, and various ceremonial practices crucial to understanding Gujarati folklore.

## Cultural Significance

This collection provides valuable anthropological and cultural documentation of 19th-century Indian folklore, preserving knowledge that might otherwise have been lost as traditional practices changed under colonial and modernizing influences.
