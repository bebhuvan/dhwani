  The Āʾīn-i-Akbarī, an integral volume of the comprehensive administrative chronicle Akbarnāma, represents a seminal work of Mughal imperial documentation from the late 16th century. Composed by Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak, the chief historian and advisor to Emperor Akbar, this encyclopedic text provides an unprecedented systematic overview of the Mughal administrative, social, and cultural infrastructure during one of India's most intellectually vibrant historical periods. The English translation by scholars Henry Blochmann and Henry Sullivan Jarrett (1891-1894) made this critical historical document accessible to Western scholarly audiences, offering detailed insights into the administrative, economic, and cultural mechanisms of the Mughal Empire at its zenith. The work meticulously catalogues administrative departments, provincial governance structures, military organization, economic systems, cultural practices, and social hierarchies, serving as an invaluable archival resource for understanding the complexity of Mughal statecraft and societal organization. Abu'l-Fazl's narrative combines empirical documentation with nuanced philosophical commentary, reflecting the syncretic intellectual environment of Akbar's court, which sought to integrate diverse cultural and religious traditions. The text is particularly significant for its detailed ethnographic descriptions of provincial populations, economic practices, agricultural systems, and technological innovations, providing contemporary scholars with a comprehensive window into 16th-century Indian societal dynamics. Beyond its historical value, the Āʾīn-i-Akbarī exemplifies the sophisticated bureaucratic and intellectual achievements of the Mughal period, demonstrating the advanced administrative and cultural sophistication of pre-colonial Indian civilization.

# The Āʾīn-i-Akbarī (English Translation)

## Overview

The Āʾīn-i-Akbarī is a comprehensive administrative gazetteer of the Mughal Empire composed by Abu'l-Fazl in Persian during the 1590s, documenting conditions as they existed circa 1590 during Emperor Akbar's reign. The work forms the third and final volume of the Akbarnama, serving as the statistical and administrative complement to that broader historical chronicle. Written in Persian, the Ain-i-Akbari constitutes one of the first Persian texts translated into English, with Heinrich Blochmann rendering Volumes I and II in 1873, while Colonel Henry Sullivan Jarrett completed Volume III in 1891 and Volumes IV-V in 1896, all published through the Asiatic Society of Bengal's Bibliotheca Indica series.

The work functions simultaneously as an administrative report and statistical return of Akbar's government, providing quantitative documentation of imperial household operations, military organization, provincial administration, and cultural practices across the empire. The text records the implementation of Raja Todar Mal's systematic revenue collection framework, the Bandobast, which divided Akbar's territory into 15 Subahs (provinces), further subdivided into 187 Sarkars (revenue circles), and ultimately into 3,367 Mahals or Parganas (revenue units). This administrative architecture, documented through careful survey work conducted between 1570-1580, established standardized revenue assessments based on empirical crop yield data and market price calculations across individual revenue circles, each maintaining distinct rates and crop schedules.

The Ain-i-Akbari represents an unprecedented attempt to compile systematic statistical data on imperial governance, providing detailed fiscal information, agricultural production records, wage and price documentation, and administrative protocols that establish it as a foundational primary source for Mughal economic and administrative history. The English translation project extended over two decades following Blochmann's premature death in 1878, requiring Jarrett to complete the substantial remaining volumes documenting provincial administration, cultural practices, and Akbar's philosophical teachings.

## About Abu'l-Fazl

Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak (14 January 1551 – 22 August 1602) served as grand vizier of the Mughal Empire from 1579 until his assassination in 1602, functioning as Emperor Akbar's chief political advisor and court historian. Born in Agra, Abu'l-Fazl joined Akbar's court in 1575 at age 24 and quickly became one of the Navaratnas (Nine Jewels) of the imperial court, wielding considerable influence in shaping Akbar's increasingly liberal religious policies during the 1580s and 1590s. His role as court chronicler produced the monumental Akbarnama, a comprehensive history of Akbar's reign, and the Ain-i-Akbari, the administrative and statistical record that formed its third volume.

Abu'l-Fazl's assassination on 22 August 1602 near Narwar occurred while he was returning from a Deccan campaign, orchestrated by Prince Salim (the future Emperor Jahangir) through the agency of Vir Singh Bundela. Salim ordered the killing partly because Abu'l-Fazl was known to oppose the prince's succession to the throne, viewing him as temperamentally unsuited for imperial governance. Beyond the Akbarnama and Ain-i-Akbari, Abu'l-Fazl's literary corpus included the Ruqaʿāt (collected letters) and a Persian translation of the Bible, demonstrating his engagement with diverse religious and philosophical traditions that characterized Akbar's court culture.

## About the Translators

Heinrich Blochmann (8 January 1838 – 13 July 1878), known in English contexts as Henry Ferdinand Blochmann, was a German orientalist who spent his career in India specializing in Persian language and literature. Born in Dresden, Blochmann studied oriental languages at the University of Leipzig under Heinrich Leberecht Fleischer before continuing his studies in Paris in 1857. At age 22, he secured his first government appointment in 1860 as assistant professor of Arabic and Persian at Calcutta Madrasa (now Aliah University) through the patronage of William Nassau Lees, the institution's principal. After a brief interlude as pro-rector and mathematics professor at Doveton College (1861-1865), Blochmann returned to the Madrasa in 1865, eventually becoming its principal and serving as philological secretary to the Asiatic Society of Bengal from 1868. He completed the translation of Volumes I and II of the Ain-i-Akbari in 1873, but died on 13 July 1878 at age 40, leaving the remaining three volumes untranslated. He was buried in Calcutta's Circular Road cemetery.

Colonel Henry Sullivan Jarrett (1839-1919), recipient of the Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE), undertook the completion of Blochmann's unfinished translation work after the Asiatic Society of Bengal discovered that Blochmann had completed only the first volume before his death. Jarrett, an English scholar and translator, completed the translation of Volume III (containing Book III on provincial administration) in 1891 and Volumes IV-V (covering Hindu philosophy, social customs, and Akbar's moral teachings) in 1896, both published by the Asiatic Society of Calcutta. The complete translation was later corrected and annotated by Sir Jadunath Sarkar in 1949. Jarrett also translated other significant Persian works into English, including the Tarikh al-Khulafa (History of the Caliphs) and the Divan-i-Hafiz.

## The Work

The Ain-i-Akbari divides into five distinct books, each addressing specific dimensions of Mughal imperial administration and culture. Book I (Manzil-Abadi) contains 90 regulations governing imperial household maintenance, documenting the mint operations, imperial harem administration, royal seals, kitchen operations, military logistics, animal maintenance records, laborers' wages, house-building cost estimates, artillery specifications, and equipment inventories. Ain 76 specifically outlines salary determination protocols for officials recruited from Iran, Turkey, Europe, Hindustan, and Kashmir, while other regulations detail the provision of fruits, vegetables, perfumes, and carpets for imperial use. Book II (Sipah-Abadi) describes the military and civil services, court attendants, and the Mansabdari System that structured Mughal military-bureaucratic ranks, including Ain 25 on educational protocols for letter instruction methods and the Monday muster system for cavalry review and imperial compensation practices.

Book III (Mulk-Abadi) focuses on judicial and executive departments, land surveys, tribal divisions, and financial records, providing the work's most extensive statistical contribution through detailed accounts of administration, land revenue collection, and tribal divisions across each of the 15 Subahs. This volume documents the Todarmal Bandobast revenue system's three main features: systematic survey and measurement of land, classification of land according to productivity levels, and standardized assessment of land revenue based on empirical data. The provincial accounts, exemplified by the Bengal section, typically divide into three parts: historical and geographical overview of the Subah, agricultural and industrial products with flora and fauna documentation for constituent Sarkars (Bengal contained 19 Sarkars), and the detailed rent-roll of the province. The text records crop diversity data, noting that Agra produced 39 crop varieties, Delhi 43 varieties across two growing seasons, and Bengal 50 varieties of rice alone.

The Mulk-Abadi section provides extensive quantitative data on revenue rates, geographic and economic profiles of provinces, statistical details on crops, yields, prices, wages, and revenues, along with appendices documenting measures of land, weights, coinage values, and the gold and copper value of the rupee. Revenue statistics include jama (assessed revenue) and hasil (collected revenue) figures. The 1595 documentation recorded bighas (measured land units) across 12 provinces and constituent Sarkars. However, the fiscal data exhibits geographic bias, as price and wage documentation derives primarily from areas in or around the imperial capital of Agra rather than representing comprehensive coverage across all Subahs. Book IV addresses Hindu philosophy, social customs, law, and literature, examining the caste system and occupational classifications within Akbar's domains. Book V compiles Akbar's moral teachings and recorded sayings, presenting the emperor's philosophical and ethical perspectives as documented by his court historian.

## Historical Significance

The Ain-i-Akbari constitutes the foundational primary source for Mughal administrative history, providing unparalleled documentation of imperial governance structures, revenue systems, and statistical baselines for late 16th-century India. The work's systematic compilation of quantitative data on land measurement, crop yields, revenue assessments, and administrative divisions enables historians to analyze Mughal economic organization, agricultural productivity, and fiscal capacity with empirical precision unavailable for earlier Indian polities. The documentation of the Todarmal Bandobast system records one of pre-modern South Asia's most sophisticated attempts at standardized revenue administration, establishing a cadastral framework based on systematic land surveys, productivity classifications, and multi-year price averaging that influenced subsequent revenue systems under later Mughal emperors and British colonial administrators.

As a historical source, the Ain-i-Akbari provides critical evidence for understanding social stratification, occupational structures, and cultural practices during Akbar's reign, documenting the empire's ethnic diversity through salary regulations for officials from multiple geographic origins and recording Hindu philosophical and social systems alongside Islamic administrative frameworks. The work's statistical data on provincial geography, crop varieties, and revenue yields establishes empirical baselines for analyzing long-term economic change in the Indian subcontinent. The text's documentation of weights, measures, and coinage systems provides essential reference material for historians working with Mughal-era commercial and administrative records.

The English translation by Blochmann and Jarrett significantly expanded Western scholarly access to Mughal administrative and economic history, making detailed Persian-language documentation available to anglophone historians, economists, and colonial administrators. The translation project's completion across two decades (1873-1896) through the Asiatic Society of Bengal's Bibliotheca Indica series established standards for scholarly translation of Persian historical texts and contributed to nineteenth-century British understanding of indigenous administrative systems. Sir Jadunath Sarkar's 1949 corrections and annotations further enhanced the translation's scholarly utility, providing critical apparatus that contextualized Abu'l-Fazl's documentation within broader Mughal historiography. The Ain-i-Akbari's historiographical importance extends beyond its empirical content to its methodological innovation, representing an unprecedented attempt to document imperial governance through systematic statistical compilation rather than purely narrative historical chronicling.

## Digital Access

Multiple volumes of the English translation are available through the Internet Archive, providing scholarly access to Blochmann's and Jarrett's complete translation of Abu'l-Fazl's administrative gazetteer. These digital editions preserve the nineteenth-century English translation that introduced Western scholarship to the detailed statistical and administrative documentation of Akbar's empire, enabling continued research into Mughal economic history, governance structures, and cultural practices documented in the original Persian text.
