The Yoga-Vasishtha Maharamayana, Volume 4, Part 1, initiates the culminating section of this monumental seven-volume exposition of Advaita Vedanta philosophy. This penultimate volume advances the sacred dialogue between sage Vasistha and Prince Rama toward its ultimate resolution, presenting the most profound teachings on liberation, the nature of Nirvana, and the state of supreme consciousness. As the fourth volume in this complete series, it synthesizes and transcends all preceding philosophical developments, guiding seekers toward the highest realization.

This section primarily focuses on the Nirvana Prakarana (Section on Ultimate Extinction), which addresses the final stages of spiritual attainment and the characteristics of absolute liberation. Vasistha reveals the most subtle and advanced teachings on how the enlightened being exists beyond all dualities, transcending even the distinction between bondage and freedom. Through penetrating philosophical discourse and contemplative wisdom, the text explores the nature of final emancipation, where individual consciousness merges with the infinite absolute, yet paradoxically maintains its essential identity with that which it has always been.

Part 1 of Volume 4 in the complete 7-volume series represents a crucial transition into the highest teachings of the Maharamayana. The discussions address the ultimate questions of existence: What is the nature of complete liberation? How does one stabilize in supreme consciousness? What is the experience of the fully awakened sage? Vasistha's responses integrate profound metaphysical insights with practical guidance, showing how theoretical understanding must culminate in direct, unshakeable realization of one's true nature as pure, infinite consciousness.

This translation by Vihari-Lala Mitra brings these sublime teachings to English readers with scholarly precision and devotional sensitivity. For advanced students of Advaita Vedanta and serious spiritual practitioners, Volume 4, Part 1 offers the essential wisdom needed to understand and embody the highest state of consciousness, completing the transformative journey begun in the earlier volumes.
