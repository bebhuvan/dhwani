# The Administration of the East India Company: A History of Indian Progress

## Overview

Published in 1853 before the author entered Company service, this 740-page historical analysis examines the East India Company's administrative structures, governance policies, and territorial expansion in British India. Kaye analyzes the Company's judicial systems, taxation mechanisms, military organization, and social reform initiatives, positioning Company administration as progressive development rather than purely exploitative colonialism—a perspective reflecting mid-Victorian attitudes. Written by a military officer who would later serve under the Crown administration and become the official historian of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, this work represents an insider's view of Company operations during the final years before Crown rule.

## About Sir John William Kaye

Sir John William Kaye KCSI FRS (1814-1876) was a British military historian, civil servant, and army officer. Educated at Eton College and the Royal Military College, Addiscombe, he served as a Bengal Artillery officer from 1832 to 1841. In 1856, he succeeded John Stuart Mill as Political Assistant at East India House, and from 1858 served as Secretary in the Political and Secret Department of the Office of Secretary of State for India. His major historical work, *History of the Sepoy War in India*, was later revised as *Kaye and Malleson's History of the Indian Mutiny*.

## Historical Context

Published by R. Bentley in London in 1853, this work appeared during the final years of East India Company rule, just four years before the Indian Rebellion of 1857 that would lead to direct Crown administration. Kaye wrote as an observer before entering Company service in 1856, providing a perspective informed by military experience but not yet shaped by administrative responsibilities. The work reflects mid-Victorian confidence in British imperial governance and the civilizing mission ideology prevalent in that era.

## Content and Analysis

The work examines multiple dimensions of Company administration:
- Judicial systems and legal framework
- Taxation and revenue collection mechanisms
- Military organization and deployment
- Social reform initiatives
- Territorial expansion policies
- Governance structures and administrative procedures

Kaye's analysis positions Company rule as contributing to Indian "progress," a framing that reflects Victorian assumptions about colonial development while providing detailed documentation of administrative practices.

## Later Career and Perspective

Kaye's subsequent career path—entering Company service in 1856, transitioning to Crown administration in 1858, and becoming the official historian of the 1857 Rebellion—adds retrospective significance to this earlier work. His 1853 analysis of Company administration provides a pre-Rebellion perspective that would be dramatically altered by the events of 1857-1858 and the subsequent dissolution of Company rule.

## Digital Preservation

This 740-page work has been digitized from the University of Toronto's Robarts Library collection and is freely available through the Internet Archive. Multiple reprint editions (2002, 2015, 2023) demonstrate continuing scholarly and historical interest in Company administration during its final years.
