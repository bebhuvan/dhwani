## About This Work

A. N. Mutherjee, represents the first systematic English-language historical survey of the Charvaka (Lokayata) philosophical tradition—ancient India's heterodox materialist, empiricist, and hedonist school rejecting Vedic authority, supernatural claims, karmic causation, and soteriological doctrines in favor of naturalistic ontology, sensory epistemology, and ethical hedonism emphasizing worldly pleasure as legitimate human pursuit. This concise seventy-three-page monograph synthesizes fragmentary textual evidence preserved primarily in hostile Buddhist, Jain, and Brahmanical philosophical sources that quote, summarize, and critique Charvaka positions while the sect's own foundational texts (particularly the Brihaspati Sutra attributed to the legendary founder) remain lost or survived only in heavily edited later versions, requiring scholarly reconstruction of Charvaka philosophy from polemical representations by doctrinal opponents. Shastri (1894-1961), distinguished Sanskrit scholar who received the "Shastri" title from the Director of Public Instruction, Bengal, after placing first in M.A. Sanskrit examinations and who specialized in recovering and editing rare philosophical texts, approached Charvaka intellectual history through critical analysis of references scattered across diverse source traditions: Buddhist Pali commentaries documenting materialist critiques encountered by early Buddhist monks; Jain Prakrit texts recording debates with Charvaka philosophers; Brahmanical darsana compendia like Madhavacharya's fourteenth-century "Sarva-darsana-samgraha" providing systematic (if unsympathetic) exposition of Charvaka doctrines; and fragmentary verses attributed to Brihaspati and Charvaka teachers preserved in anthologies, philosophical commentaries, and dramatic literature. The work explicates core Charvaka philosophical positions: ontological materialism reducing reality to four material elements (earth, water, fire, air) denying separate spiritual substances, souls, or deities; epistemological empiricism accepting only direct sensory perception (pratyaksha) as valid knowledge source while rejecting inference, testimony, and scriptural authority; rejection of metaphysical entities including souls surviving bodily death, transmigration, karma, and supernatural causation; critique of Vedic ritual authority and priestly claims to spiritual expertise as exploitative deception; and ethical hedonism advocating intelligent pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain as proper human goals rather than ascetic renunciation or otherworldly salvation. Shastri documents Charvaka critiques of religious belief systems: arguments that consciousness emerges from material bodily organization without requiring separate soul-substance; observations that religious doctrines regarding afterlife, divine judgment, and karmic consequences lack empirical verification; economic analysis of priestly classes benefiting materially from promoting unfalsifiable supernatural claims and costly ritual observances; and ethical arguments that naturalistic hedonism provides more honest foundation for morality than fear-based religious systems threatening supernatural punishments. The monograph examines historical development from apparent Vedic-era origins (references to materialist positions in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad and other texts) through classical period systematization attributed to Brihaspati, flourishing during heterodox movements' challenge to Brahmanical orthodoxy (contemporaneous with Buddhism and Jainism circa 6th-5th century BCE), and eventual marginalization as Hindu philosophical orthodoxy consolidated and Buddhist-Jain critiques reinforced Charvaka's heterodox status. Shastri's subtitle emphasizing "sensationalism and hedonism" highlights dimensions often downplayed in sanitized presentations of Indian philosophy: Charvaka's frank advocacy for sensory pleasure-seeking, rejection of ascetic ideals dominating other Indian philosophical schools, and naturalistic ethics grounded in human desires rather than transcendent values. This emphasis countered both colonial-era Orientalist representations of Indian philosophy as uniformly spiritual and world-denying, and emerging nationalist narratives privileging "spiritual" Indian civilization against "materialist" Western modernity—contexts making Charvaka's indigenous materialism intellectually and politically significant. The work appeared shortly after Shastri's 1928 edition of "Charvaka-shashti," publishing sixty verses from the Barhaspatya sutras (Brihaspati's foundational text) preserved in fragmentary form, providing textual foundation for his historical survey. His editorial and historical scholarship established him as preeminent twentieth-century authority on Charvaka philosophy, later publishing expanded "Charvaka Philosophy" (1959) incorporating fifty-four selected Barhaspatya sutra verses with extensive commentary. The 1930 historical survey received scholarly attention in major Indological journals including the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, with reviewers acknowledging Shastri's valuable recovery of neglected philosophical tradition while noting interpretive challenges inherent in reconstructing "heretical" movements from hostile sources. Modern philosophical scholarship on Indian materialism relies substantially on Shastri's textual recovery and historical reconstruction, though recent work has complicated his narrative by examining how Brahmanical sources strategically misrepresented Charvaka positions to construct easily refutable "straw man" versions serving apologetic purposes. Contemporary interest in Charvaka reflects multiple scholarly agendas: historians of Indian philosophy documenting intellectual diversity beyond dominant religious-metaphysical schools; scholars examining indigenous rationalist and empiricist traditions challenging narratives of exclusively Western Enlightenment origins for such positions; and researchers investigating how marginalization of materialist and atheistic traditions within Indian philosophical canons reflects power dynamics privileging religious-metaphysical worldviews supported by institutional authorities (temples, monasteries, royal courts) over naturalistic positions lacking comparable institutional backing. The work's preservation through Digital Library of India digitization makes Shastri's pioneering scholarship accessible to contemporary researchers, though the text's brevity and reliance on fragmentary sources limits comprehensive treatment requiring consultation of Shastri's later expanded studies and recent scholarly reassessments incorporating postcolonial critical perspectives on how "heterodox" philosophical positions get constructed, transmitted, and either marginalized or recovered within knowledge traditions shaped by institutional power relations.


## Publication Context and Scholarly Significance

"A Short History of Indian Materialism, Sensationalism and Hedonism" appeared in 1930 during a crucial period in Indian philosophical scholarship when Bengali intellectuals were systematically recovering and interpreting classical Indian philosophical traditions often marginalized in both colonial Orientalist scholarship and emerging Hindu nationalist narratives. Dakshinaranjan Shastri, already established as distinguished Sanskrit scholar through his first-place M.A. performance and subsequent textual editions, addressed the neglected Charvaka (Lokayata) materialist tradition that had survived primarily through hostile references in Buddhist, Jain, and Brahmanical philosophical texts rather than through preserved indigenous literature.

The work's publication followed Shastri's 1928 edition of "Charvaka-shashti," which made available sixty verses from the Barhaspatya sutras—fragmentary remains of Brihaspati's foundational Charvaka text preserved through quotation in rival philosophical commentaries. This textual recovery provided documentary foundation for the 1930 historical survey, demonstrating Shastri's methodology of establishing reliable source materials before constructing interpretive narratives. The combination positioned Shastri as preeminent twentieth-century authority on Charvaka philosophy, a status reinforced by his later expanded study "Charvaka Philosophy" (1959).

The book's emphasis on "sensationalism and hedonism" addressed dimensions of Charvaka thought often minimized in presentations emphasizing Indian philosophy's spiritual character. This frankness about materialist and pleasure-affirming dimensions countered both Orientalist representations of India as uniformly otherworldly and nationalist narratives privileging "spiritual" Indian civilization against "materialist" Western modernity. Recovering indigenous Indian materialism challenged essentialist civilizational contrasts while demonstrating ancient India's philosophical diversity.

## Philosophical Content and Methodology

The monograph reconstructs Charvaka philosophy through critical analysis of fragmentary sources, distinguishing (where possible) authentic Charvaka positions from polemical misrepresentations by doctrinal opponents. Shastri examines core philosophical commitments: ontological materialism reducing reality to four elements without separate spiritual substances; epistemological empiricism accepting only sensory perception as valid knowledge source; rejection of souls, transmigration, karma, and supernatural causation; critique of Vedic ritual authority and priestly claims as exploitative; and ethical hedonism advocating pleasure-seeking as legitimate human goal.

The work analyzes Charvaka critiques of religious systems: arguments that consciousness emerges from material organization without requiring souls; observations that afterlife doctrines lack empirical verification; economic analysis of priestly classes benefiting from promoting unfalsifiable supernatural claims; and ethical arguments for naturalistic hedonism over fear-based religious morality. These positions represented radical challenges to dominant Indian philosophical schools whether Brahmanical, Buddhist, or Jain.

Shastri documents historical development from Vedic-era origins through classical systematization attributed to Brihaspati, flourishing during heterodox movements' challenge to Brahmanical orthodoxy, and eventual marginalization as religious philosophical systems consolidated institutional power. The reconstruction engages methodological challenges inherent in studying "heretical" movements known primarily through antagonistic sources, requiring critical assessment of which attributed positions reflect actual Charvaka views versus convenient "straw man" constructions serving apologetic purposes.

## Scholarly Legacy and Modern Reassessment

The work established foundational scholarly understanding of Charvaka philosophy for twentieth-century Indian philosophical studies, providing textual basis and historical framework for subsequent research. Contemporary interest reflects multiple agendas: documenting Indian philosophical diversity beyond dominant religious-metaphysical traditions; examining indigenous rationalist and empiricist positions; and investigating marginalization of materialist and atheistic philosophies within canons shaped by religious institutional power.

Modern scholarship has complicated Shastri's reconstruction by examining how Brahmanical sources strategically misrepresented Charvaka to construct easily refutable positions, by analyzing why materialist traditions lacked institutional preservation comparable to religious philosophies supported by temples and monasteries, and by considering postcolonial perspectives on how "heterodox" positions get constructed and marginalized within knowledge traditions shaped by power relations. The work remains essential reading for historians of Indian philosophy while requiring supplementation through critical awareness of source biases and recent scholarly reassessments.
