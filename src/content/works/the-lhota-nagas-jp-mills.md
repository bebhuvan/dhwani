description: |
  Published in 1922 during the late British colonial period, Mills' ethnographic monograph represents a significant scholarly documentation of the Lhota Naga tribe during a transformative moment in Northeast Indian cultural history. As a colonial administrative officer and trained ethnographer stationed in the Naga Hills of Assam, James Philip Mills produced a meticulously detailed scholarly record that provides unprecedented insights into the complex social structures and cultural practices of an Indigenous Naga community at a critical juncture of potential cultural disruption. The work emerges from the broader colonial-era anthropological project of systematically documenting Indigenous societies before rapid socio-cultural transformations, yet distinguishes itself through Mills' remarkably comprehensive and nuanced approach to understanding Lhota Naga life. The monograph offers extensive documentation of the tribe's intricate clan-based exogamous social organization, including the distinctive morung (communal male dormitory) system, marriage prohibitions, village governance structures, and elaborate ritual practices. Of particular scholarly significance are Mills' detailed accounts of religious ceremonies (gennas), traditional head-hunting practices, property inheritance systems, and comprehensive documentation of life-cycle rituals encompassing birth, marriage, divorce, and death. Beyond mere descriptive ethnography, the work provides crucial anthropological insights into Indigenous belief systems, spiritual cosmologies, and social mechanisms of cultural reproduction during a period of intense external colonial pressures. Mills' scholarship represents an important contribution to understanding the complex cultural dynamics of Northeast Indian tribal societies, preserving invaluable ethnographic knowledge that might otherwise have been lost to historical transformation.

# The Lhota Nagas

## Overview

"The Lhota Nagas" by J. P. Mills (James Philip Mills), published in 1922, is a comprehensive ethnographic monograph documenting one of the major Naga tribal groups of Assam (now Nagaland). Written during Mills' service as a colonial administrator in the Naga Hills, this work represents systematic anthropological documentation of a community undergoing rapid transformation through British contact.

## Historical Context

J. P. Mills served in the Indian Civil Service in the Naga Hills district from 1916-1936, combining administrative duties with serious ethnographic research. His work belongs to the tradition of British colonial ethnography that sought to document "primitive" cultures, though Mills showed genuine respect for Naga societies and concern for their welfare. The 1920s marked a critical period when traditional Naga practices were being disrupted by colonial administration, Christian missionary activity, and integration into wider economic systems.
