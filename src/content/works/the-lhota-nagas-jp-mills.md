# The Lhota Nagas

## Overview

"The Lhota Nagas" by J. P. Mills (James Philip Mills), published in 1922, is a comprehensive ethnographic monograph documenting one of the major Naga tribal groups of Assam (now Nagaland). Written during Mills' service as a colonial administrator in the Naga Hills, this work represents systematic anthropological documentation of a community undergoing rapid transformation through British contact.

## Historical Context

J. P. Mills served in the Indian Civil Service in the Naga Hills district from 1916-1936, combining administrative duties with serious ethnographic research. His work belongs to the tradition of British colonial ethnography that sought to document "primitive" cultures, though Mills showed genuine respect for Naga societies and concern for their welfare. The 1920s marked a critical period when traditional Naga practices were being disrupted by colonial administration, Christian missionary activity, and integration into wider economic systems.

## Significance

**Ethnographic Value**: Provides detailed primary documentation of Lhota Naga culture at a specific historical moment, preserving knowledge of practices that subsequently changed or disappeared. Essential baseline for understanding cultural change.

**Comparative Anthropology**: Contributes to understanding of tribal societies in Northeast India, allowing comparison with other Naga groups and broader patterns in the region.

**Colonial Documentation**: Represents both the strengths (systematic observation, detailed recording) and limitations (colonial biases, outsider perspective) of early 20th-century British ethnography.

**Cultural Preservation**: While written by an outsider, the work preserves cultural knowledge valuable to Lhota Nagas themselves for understanding their heritage.

**Historical Source**: Documents the interface between tribal societies and colonial administration, showing how traditional practices adapted to new political realities.

## How to Access
