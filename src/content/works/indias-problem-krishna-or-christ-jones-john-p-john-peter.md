# India's Problem, Krishna or Christ

## Overview

John P. Jones's "India's Problem: Krishna or Christ" (1901) presents a comprehensive examination of India's social, religious, and economic conditions during the early years of the twentieth century. Through this analytical framework, Jones explores the central question posed by his title: whether India's future will be shaped by the continuation of Hindu philosophy and practice or by Christian transformation. Rather than treating this as a purely theological question, Jones contextualizes religious choice within broader social and historical circumstances, examining poverty, conservatism, cultural tradition, and the appeal of competing worldviews. The work reflects the missionary consciousness of its era while providing valuable documentation of early twentieth-century Indian society.

## The Indian Context: Geography and Diversity

Jones begins his analysis by establishing the vast geographical, cultural, and linguistic diversity of the Indian subcontinent. He documents India's immense population, disparate regions, varied climates, and the multiplicity of languages and cultures comprising Indian civilization. This emphasis on diversity serves both to illustrate India's complexity and to explain the challenges facing any transformative movement or religion seeking to reshape Indian society. Jones acknowledges that understanding India requires grappling with its heterogeneity and resisting simplistic generalizations. His detailed attention to regional variation anticipates later scholarly approaches to Indian studies.

## Hindu Society and Tradition

The work provides extensive description of Hindu society, examining the caste system, religious practices, philosophical traditions, and the social structures supporting Hindu civilization. Rather than dismissing Hinduism as mere superstition, Jones treats it as a comprehensive philosophical and social system that has sustained Indian civilization for millennia. He acknowledges both the spiritual insights and the social rigidities embedded in Hindu tradition. Jones's analysis suggests that Hindu culture maintains powerful appeal because it addresses fundamental human concerns while providing satisfying frameworks for understanding existence and organizing society.

## The Missionary Question

Through his analysis of India's conditions and Hindu tradition, Jones pursues the central question of whether Christian missionary activity can successfully transform Indian society. He examines practical obstacles to Christian conversion, including deep attachment to ancestral traditions, the association of Christianity with colonial domination, and the intellectual appeal of Hindu philosophy. Rather than assuming inevitable Christian triumph, Jones honestly assesses both the potential and the limitations of Christian missionary work in India. The book ultimately advocates for Christian engagement with India while recognizing that India's religious future remains genuinely uncertain and will be determined by complex historical and cultural forces beyond missionary control.
