# The Raghuvamsa of Kalidasa

## Overview

The *Raghuvamsa* (The Dynasty of Raghu) stands as one of the two great mahakavyas composed by Kalidasa, classical Sanskrit's most celebrated poet. This 1922 scholarly edition by M.R. Kale presents the first ten cantos with the original Sanskrit text, Mallinatha Suri's 14th-century Sanjivani commentary, literal English translation, and extensive philological apparatus spanning 662 pages.

## The Poet: Kalidasa

Kalidasa (c. 4th-5th century CE) is regarded as the greatest Sanskrit poet and dramatist. Tradition associates him with the court of Chandragupta II Vikramaditya of the Gupta Empire, though scholarly debate continues about his exact dates. His works—including *Shakuntala*, *Meghaduta*, and *Kumarasambhava*—represent the pinnacle of classical Sanskrit literature.

## The Epic

The *Raghuvamsa* comprises 19 cantos narrating the glorious lineage of the Solar dynasty (Suryavamsha) descended from King Raghu:

**Cantos 1-10** (included in this edition):
- Cantos 1-2: King Dilipa and the birth of Raghu
- Cantos 3-6: Raghu's conquests and glory
- Cantos 7-8: Aja's romance with Indumati
- Cantos 9-10: Dasharatha and the birth of Rama

**Cantos 11-19** (not included):
- Rama's exploits (treated briefly, as the Ramayana already covers this extensively)
- The later kings through Agnivarna, whose dissolution marks the dynasty's decline

## Literary Characteristics

The *Raghuvamsa* exemplifies the mahakavya (great poem) genre:

**Metrical Virtuosity:** Composed in 21 different Sanskrit meters, demonstrating Kalidasa's complete mastery of prosody.

**Ornamentation (Alamkara):** Rich use of similes, metaphors, and other poetic devices that characterize classical Sanskrit court poetry.

**Emotional Range (Rasa):** The poem encompasses multiple aesthetic moods from the heroic (vira) to the erotic (shrungara) to the pathetic (karuna).

**Natural Description:** Kalidasa's famous sensitivity to natural beauty appears throughout, particularly in seasonal descriptions and landscape imagery.

## The Commentary: Mallinatha's Sanjivani

Mallinatha Suri (c. 1346-1440) composed commentaries on major classical Sanskrit poems that became standard references. His Sanjivani ("Life-Giver") commentary on the *Raghuvamsa*:

- Provides word-by-word grammatical analysis
- Explains difficult compounds and rare vocabulary
- Offers contextual interpretation of verses
- Cites parallel passages from other Sanskrit literature
- Became the most influential commentary, used by generations of students

## This Edition: M.R. Kale's Contribution

Moreshvar Ramchandra Kale (fl. early 20th century) produced scholarly editions of major Sanskrit classics for students. His edition includes:

- Devanagari Sanskrit text
- Mallinatha's complete Sanjivani commentary
- Literal English translation maintaining the original word order where possible
- Copious notes explaining grammatical constructions, cultural references, and textual variants
- Comparative readings from different manuscript traditions

Published by P.S. Rege in Bombay, this edition became a standard text for Sanskrit students.

## Themes and Significance

The poem explores:

**Dharma (Righteousness):** Kings as embodiments of dharma, their duties to subjects and cosmic order.

**Ideal Kingship:** The Raghu dynasty represents the classical conception of just and glorious rule.

**Transience:** Despite their glory, even the Raghus decline, illustrating the impermanence of worldly power.

**Love and Loss:** Particularly in the Aja-Indumati episode, Kalidasa explores romantic love and grief with characteristic sensitivity.

## Why Only Ten Cantos?

Scholarly consensus suggests Kalidasa composed cantos 1-15 or 1-16, with the remaining cantos being later additions by another hand. The marked decline in poetic quality after canto 15 has long been noted. Kale's edition focusing on the first ten cantos presents the portion most certainly authentic and of highest literary merit.

## Influence and Legacy

The *Raghuvamsa* profoundly influenced later Sanskrit poetry:

- Became a model mahakavya, studied by aspiring poets
- Inspired numerous commentaries and imitations
- Particular passages became famous examples for rhetorical treatises
- Continues to be studied as essential classical Sanskrit literature

## How to Access

Available through Internet Archive as a digitized scan from the University of Toronto library collection. Public domain, freely accessible for research and education. This edition remains valuable for serious students of Sanskrit due to its inclusion of Mallinatha's commentary and Kale's detailed notes.
