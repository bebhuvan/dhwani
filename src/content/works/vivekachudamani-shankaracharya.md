description: "Adi Shankaracharya's Vivekachudamani stands as Advaita Vedanta's most accessible and comprehensive practical guide to discrimination (viveka) between the eternal Self (Atman) and the transient non-Self, leading seekers from bondage to liberation. Composed in 8th century CE, this work of 580 verses employs dialogue format between guru and disciple, systematically presenting: qualifications for spiritual inquiry (sadhana-chatushtayaâ€”discrimination, dispassion, six virtues, desire for liberation); analysis of Maya's illusory power creating apparent world-plurality; meditation on 'tat tvam asi' (thou art That) and other Upanishadic mahavakyas; techniques for self-inquiry distinguishing witness-consciousness from mental modifications; and description of jivanmukti (liberation while living). Written in clear Sanskrit verse mixing instruction with devotional fervor, the text bridges technical Vedantic philosophy and practical spiritual guidance. Its attribution to Shankara remains debated, yet the work's influence on Advaita teaching traditions proves undeniable, serving as standard introduction to non-dualistic realization across centuries."
