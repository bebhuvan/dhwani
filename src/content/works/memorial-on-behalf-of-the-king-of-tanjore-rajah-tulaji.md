# Memorial on Behalf of the King of Tanjore

## Overview
Drafted in London for presentation to Lord North’s cabinet, the memorial articulates the grievances of Rajah Tulaji as East India Company forces tightened control over Tanjore. The document outlines treaty obligations, revenue settlements, and the humanitarian costs of prolonged sieges, offering a South Indian perspective on imperial negotiations usually recorded by British administrators.

## Highlights
Tulaji’s case emphasises the legitimacy of his succession, the kingdom’s prior alliances with the British, and the hardship inflicted on cultivators when Company agents diverted grain and tax receipts. Marginal notes mark key petitions to Parliament, revealing how Indian rulers leveraged British legal structures to defend sovereignty.

## Access Notes
The short pamphlet digitised by the University of California Libraries is fully searchable, with high-resolution scans that preserve italic annotations and typographical cues used to stress key arguments before Parliament.
