description: "Somadeva Bhatta's Kathasaritsagara (Ocean of the Streams of Story) stands as one of the largest and most important story collections in world literature, comprising over 21,000 verses organized into 124 chapters (tarangas) across eighteen books (lambakas). Composed in 11th-century Kashmir for Queen Suryamati, this monumental work adapts and expands the lost Brihatkatha of Gunadhya, weaving together hundreds of tales featuring kings, merchants, courtesans, ascetics, gods, demons, and magical beings. The frame narrative follows Prince Naravahanadatta's quest to become emperor of the vidyadharas (celestial magicians), while embedded stories explore themes of love, loyalty, wit, transformation, and destiny. Drawing from ancient Indian oral traditions, Jataka tales, Panchatantra fables, and pan-Indian folklore, the Kathasaritsagara preserves narrative traditions that influenced The Arabian Nights, Boccaccio's Decameron, and Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, making it essential for understanding the global circulation of story motifs."
