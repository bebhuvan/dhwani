# Akbar, Emperor of India

## Overview

Published in 1909, Richard von Garbe's biography of Akbar offers a distinctly cultural and philosophical perspective on the Mughal emperor. Unlike British administrative histories emphasizing political and military achievements, Garbe—a German Sanskrit scholar and philosopher—presents Akbar through the lens of cultural synthesis, daily court life, artistic patronage, and the intellectual climate of 16th-century Mughal India.

Garbe's approach reflects German academic interest in Indian philosophy and religion. Where British scholars often focused on governance and territorial expansion, German Indologists like Garbe sought to understand Indian thought systems, aesthetic traditions, and cultural practices. This philosophical orientation shapes the biography, emphasizing Akbar's religious experimentation, cultural patronage, and the cosmopolitan atmosphere of his court.

## About Richard von Garbe (1857-1927)

Born in Prussia, Garbe studied Sanskrit under Hermann Grassmann and Rudolph von Roth, completing his Ph.D. at Tübingen in 1876. He became professor at Königsberg (1880), conducted research in India (1885-1887), and was appointed chair of Sanskrit and comparative religious studies at Tübingen (1895), serving as university rector in 1908.

Garbe specialized in Indian philosophy, particularly Samkhya—the dualistic philosophical system emphasizing prakrti (matter) and purusha (consciousness). His critical editions and translations of the Bhagavad Gita, Atharvaveda, and his major work *Die Sâmkhya-Philosophie* (1917) established him as a leading Indologist. He mentored Rudolf Otto, whose phenomenology of religion would profoundly influence religious studies.

Garbe's scholarly approach combined philological rigor with philosophical engagement. He didn't just translate texts but sought to understand the worldviews they expressed. This philosophical orientation informs his Akbar biography—interest in the emperor's religious thought, cultural synthesis, and the intellectual environment of his court.

## Cultural Biography Approach

Garbe structures the work around themes rather than strict chronology: court life, religious policy, artistic patronage, social customs, women's status, architecture, and cultural achievements. This thematic organization allows deeper exploration of Mughal civilization's texture and character.

The biography emphasizes Akbar's cultural cosmopolitanism—Persian, Indian, Islamic, Hindu, Jain, and even Christian influences blending at his court. Garbe describes the translation projects (Persian and Sanskrit texts rendered into each other's languages), the development of Mughal miniature painting, the architectural innovations of Fatehpur Sikri, and the interfaith debates Akbar hosted.

Garbe presents Akbar's Din-i-Ilahi not primarily as political strategy but as genuine philosophical quest—an emperor seeking universal spiritual truth beyond sectarian boundaries. This sympathetic interpretation reflects Garbe's own philosophical interests and German academic traditions less bound to colonial apologetics than British scholarship.

## German Indology Perspective

German scholars approached India differently than their British counterparts. Lacking colonial stake, Germans could pursue more detached scholarly interest. Philosophers from Schopenhauer to Hegel had engaged Indian thought; German universities established Sanskrit chairs focused on literature and philosophy rather than colonial administration.

Garbe's biography reflects this tradition—scholarly, philosophical, culturally appreciative. While still Eurocentric in frameworks and occasionally condescending, it avoids the cruder colonial stereotypes. Garbe respects Mughal cultural achievement, seeing in Akbar's court a sophisticated civilization worthy of serious study.

This German perspective offered alternative to British colonial historiography, showing that Western engagement with Indian history could take multiple forms—administrative, philosophical, cultural, literary—each revealing different aspects of India's past.

## This Digital Edition

Available through Project Gutenberg and Internet Archive, Garbe's cultural biography complements political histories like Vincent Arthur Smith's. Together they show diverse Western approaches to Akbar—British administrative focus versus German philosophical-cultural interest—while both grappling with the challenge of understanding a civilization fundamentally different from their own yet possessing undeniable sophistication and achievement.
