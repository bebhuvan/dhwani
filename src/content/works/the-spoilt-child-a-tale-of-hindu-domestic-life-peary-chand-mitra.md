description: |
  Incisive portrayal of Hindu domestic life through excessive parental indulgence and its moral consequences, originally written in Bengali by Peary Chand Mitra (1814-1883), prominent Bengal Renaissance figure, translated into English by G.D. Oswell (1893). The novel examines character formation of Matilall, spoiled son of wealthy landowner Baburam Babu. Mitra, celebrated as pioneer of the Bengali novel and nicknamed "the Dickens of Bengal" by Reverend James Long, explored broader themes of wealth, education, moral development, and family dynamics within traditional Hindu society. Matilall's childhood features complete indulgence of every whim and resistance to educational discipline or moral guidance. As a member of Henry Derozio's reformist Young Bengal movement, Mitra critiqued social practices prioritizing material comfort over character development, examining how traditional family structures could nurture or corrupt younger generations. The narrative vividly portrays relationships marked by indulgence, displaying keen observation of human psychology and social behavior. Through Matilall's development from petulant child to problematic adult, the work illustrates how parental weakness and excessive wealth undermine moral formation, creating individuals unprepared for life's responsibilities. Mitra's 1857 Bengali novel "Alaler Gharer Dulal" (literally "The Spoilt Child of the Mansion"), considered the first genuine Bengali novel, pioneered colloquial Bengali prose. This 1893 English translation (Thacker, Spink and Co.) made Mitra's insights accessible to English readers, offering insider perspectives on Hindu domestic life. The work explores universal themes—parental responsibility, moral education, social anxiety, consequences of indulgence—providing authentic representation of Bengali society during transformative periods.
