description: "The Brahmanda Purana stands among the eighteen Mahapuranas with distinctive emphasis on cosmology and cosmic structure, comprising approximately 12,000 verses focused on universe's form, dimensions, and organizational principles. Composed between 4th-7th centuries CE (with core material likely around 500 CE), this text presents: detailed cosmography describing universe shaped as cosmic egg (brahmanda) containing multiple realms, comprehensive geography of earth including continents, oceans, mountains, and rivers, genealogies connecting divine, semi-divine, and human lineages, elaborate descriptions of cosmic time cycles and periodic dissolutions, Lalita Sahasranama (Thousand Names of Goddess Lalita)â€”one of Hinduism's most important devotional hymns to the Divine Mother, and notably the Adhyatma Ramayana section presenting philosophical-devotional interpretation of Rama narrative emphasizing Rama as supreme Brahman. The text exhibits synthetic character incorporating Vaishnavite, Shaiva, and Shakta elements within overarching cosmological framework. The Brahmanda Purana's influence on Hindu cosmological imagination, goddess worship traditions, and devotional literature proves significant, particularly through the Lalita Sahasranama's widespread liturgical use and the Adhyatma Ramayana's theological interpretation of Rama as absolute divinity. The text demonstrates Puranic literature's capacity to synthesize mythological, philosophical, and devotional traditions within comprehensive worldview explaining cosmos structure, divine manifestations, and paths to spiritual liberation."
