# Ātmatattva viveka (Discrimination of the Nature of the Self)

## Overview

The Ātmatattva viveka is Udayanacharya's magisterial philosophical work defending the existence of a permanent self (atman) against Buddhist no-self (anatman) doctrines. This 553-page Sanskrit treatise, published in 1940 by Jai Krishna Das Hari Das, represents one of the most sophisticated applications of Nyaya logic to fundamental metaphysical questions about personal identity and consciousness.

## Historical Context

Udayanacharya (c. 975-1050 CE), one of Nyaya-Vaisheshika school's greatest philosophers, worked during a period of intense philosophical debate between Buddhist and Brahmanical schools. Buddhist philosophers like Dignaga and Dharmakirti had developed powerful epistemological critiques of substance ontology, arguing that what we call "self" is merely a causal series of momentary mental events. Udayana's response represents the mature Nyaya counter-offensive, employing the same rigorous logical methods that Buddhists had pioneered.

## Content

**Central Thesis**: Establishes through systematic logical argument that the self (atman) exists as an eternal, substantial entity distinct from consciousness, knowledge, and mental states.

**Against Buddhist Momentariness**: Refutes Buddhist doctrines of:
- Kshanikavada (momentariness of all existence)
- Vijnanavada (consciousness-only doctrine)
- Pratityasamutpada (dependent origination as alternative to substantial self)

**Epistemological Arguments**: Critically examines Buddhist pramana (means of knowledge) theory:
- Analyzes Dignaga's theory of perception and inference
- Challenges Dharmakirti's epistemological nominalism
- Defends Nyaya realism about universals and substances

**Positive Establishment**: Provides Nyaya-Vaisheshika arguments for atman:
- Self as substance (dravya) possessing qualities
- Self as locus of cognition, memory, and recognition
- Self as agent of action and experiencer of results
- Necessity of permanent self for moral responsibility

**Logical Methodology**: Employs sophisticated Nyaya inferential reasoning (anumana), analyzing:
- Vyapti (pervasion/invariable concomitance)
- Hetvabhasa (logical fallacies)
- Tarka (reductio ad absurdum arguments)

## Significance

**Philosophical Sophistication**: Demonstrates the extraordinary level of logical and epistemological sophistication reached by medieval Indian philosophy. The debates between Udayana and Buddhist logicians represent some of the most technically refined philosophical argumentation in any tradition.

**Historical Importance**: Marks a turning point in Indian philosophical history. Udayana's systematic refutations contributed to Buddhism's intellectual decline in India, as Buddhist philosophers found it increasingly difficult to maintain their positions against refined Nyaya critiques.

**Influence on Later Philosophy**: Profoundly influenced later Navya-Nyaya (New Logic) school, which further refined the logical and epistemological tools Udayana deployed. His arguments were studied, elaborated, and debated for centuries in India's philosophical colleges (tols).

**Comparative Philosophy**: Relevant to contemporary debates in philosophy of mind about personal identity, the nature of consciousness, and substance versus bundle theories of the self. Udayana's arguments anticipate many issues in modern analytic philosophy.

**Theistic Implications**: While primarily focused on establishing atman, the work also supports theistic philosophy by defending the reality of permanent substances, paving the way for Udayana's other major work, Nyayakusumanjali, which argues for God's existence.
