  During the intellectually dynamic period of the early 11th century, when the Nalanda and Vikramashila university networks were centers of intense philosophical discourse, Udayanacharya's Ātmatattva viveka emerged as a critical intervention in the epistemological debates between Hindu and Buddhist philosophical traditions. Written circa 1025 CE, the treatise represents a sophisticated Nyaya philosophical response to Buddhist metaphysical challenges, particularly the Buddhist doctrine of anatman (no-self). Udayanacharya, a prominent scholar of the late Pratihara period, systematically employs advanced Nyaya logical methodologies to defend the Brahmanical conception of the self as an eternal, distinct substance against the Buddhist view of consciousness as momentary and non-substantial. By meticulously critiquing the epistemological frameworks of Buddhist philosophers Dignaga and Dharmakirti, the work exemplifies the intellectual rigor of medieval Indian philosophical discourse. The text is particularly significant in its deployment of systematic logical argumentation to establish theistic realism, demonstrating the complex intellectual exchanges between different philosophical schools in medieval India. Udayanacharya's work contributes critically to understanding the sophisticated intellectual traditions of the period, showcasing how philosophical debates were conducted through nuanced logical reasoning, textual interpretation, and metaphysical speculation. As a pivotal text in the Nyaya-Vaisheshika philosophical tradition, the Ātmatattva viveka illuminates the intellectual dynamism of classical Indian philosophy, revealing the complex epistemological and ontological discussions that characterized scholarly engagement during this transformative period of Indian intellectual history.

# Ātmatattva viveka (Discrimination of the Nature of the Self)

## Overview

The Ātmatattva viveka is Udayanacharya's magisterial philosophical work defending the existence of a permanent self (atman) against Buddhist no-self (anatman) doctrines. This 553-page Sanskrit treatise, published in 1940 by Jai Krishna Das Hari Das, represents one of the most sophisticated applications of Nyaya logic to fundamental metaphysical questions about personal identity and consciousness.

## Historical Context

Udayanacharya (c. 975-1050 CE), one of Nyaya-Vaisheshika school's greatest philosophers, worked during a period of intense philosophical debate between Buddhist and Brahmanical schools. Buddhist philosophers like Dignaga and Dharmakirti had developed powerful epistemological critiques of substance ontology, arguing that what we call "self" is merely a causal series of momentary mental events. Udayana's response represents the mature Nyaya counter-offensive, employing the same rigorous logical methods that Buddhists had pioneered.

## Content

**Central Thesis**: Establishes through systematic logical argument that the self (atman) exists as an eternal, substantial entity distinct from consciousness, knowledge, and mental states.

**Against Buddhist Momentariness**: Refutes Buddhist doctrines of:
- Kshanikavada (momentariness of all existence)
- Vijnanavada (consciousness-only doctrine)
- Pratityasamutpada (dependent origination as alternative to substantial self)

**Epistemological Arguments**: Critically examines Buddhist pramana (means of knowledge) theory:
- Analyzes Dignaga's theory of perception and inference
- Challenges Dharmakirti's epistemological nominalism
- Defends Nyaya realism about universals and substances

**Positive Establishment**: Provides Nyaya-Vaisheshika arguments for atman:
- Self as substance (dravya) possessing qualities
- Self as locus of cognition, memory, and recognition
- Self as agent of action and experiencer of results
- Necessity of permanent self for moral responsibility

**Logical Methodology**: Employs sophisticated Nyaya inferential reasoning (anumana), analyzing:
- Vyapti (pervasion/invariable concomitance)
- Hetvabhasa (logical fallacies)
- Tarka (reductio ad absurdum arguments)

## Significance

**Philosophical Sophistication**: Demonstrates the extraordinary level of logical and epistemological sophistication reached by medieval Indian philosophy. The debates between Udayana and Buddhist logicians represent some of the most technically refined philosophical argumentation in any tradition.

**Historical Importance**: Marks a turning point in Indian philosophical history. Udayana's systematic refutations contributed to Buddhism's intellectual decline in India, as Buddhist philosophers found it increasingly difficult to maintain their positions against refined Nyaya critiques.

**Influence on Later Philosophy**: Profoundly influenced later Navya-Nyaya (New Logic) school, which further refined the logical and epistemological tools Udayana deployed. His arguments were studied, elaborated, and debated for centuries in India's philosophical colleges (tols).

**Comparative Philosophy**: Relevant to contemporary debates in philosophy of mind about personal identity, the nature of consciousness, and substance versus bundle theories of the self. Udayana's arguments anticipate many issues in modern analytic philosophy.

**Theistic Implications**: While primarily focused on establishing atman, the work also supports theistic philosophy by defending the reality of permanent substances, paving the way for Udayana's other major work, Nyayakusumanjali, which argues for God's existence.
