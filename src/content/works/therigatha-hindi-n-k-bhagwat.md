  N.K. Bhagwat's 1956 Hindi translation of the Therigatha, published by the University of Bombay, represents significant vernacularization of one of Buddhism's most historically and literarily important canonical texts—the earliest known anthology of women's literature from ancient India, composed orally in Magadhi language between approximately the sixth and third centuries BCE and subsequently preserved in Pali within the Khuddaka Nikaya (Collection of Short Texts) of the Sutta Pitaka. This 112-page rendering makes accessible to Hindi-reading audiences the 73 poems attributed to early Buddhist nuns (theris, "elder women") who achieved arahatship (enlightenment) and recorded their spiritual journeys, psychological struggles, social circumstances, and liberation experiences in verse forms ranging from brief single-stanza utterances to extended compositions of multiple verses. The original Pali text, transmitted orally for several centuries before written compilation around 80 BCE, documents voices of women from diverse social backgrounds—former courtesans, princesses, wives, mothers, widows, and renunciants—who joined the early Buddhist sangha (monastic community) established by the Buddha following his aunt Mahapajapati Gotami's request, becoming the first formal women's monastic order in recorded Indian religious history. These verses provide unprecedented historical documentation of women's religious subjectivity, spiritual authority, and literary expression in ancient India, challenging both contemporary and later patriarchal assumptions about women's capacities for philosophical insight, religious realization, and poetic composition. Bhagwat's translation appeared during post-independence India's significant Buddhist revival, when renewed scholarly and popular interest in Buddhism—stimulated by B.R. Ambedkar's mass conversion movement (1956), archaeological discoveries, academic Buddhist studies' institutional expansion, and decolonization's re-evaluation of indigenous intellectual traditions—generated demand for accessible vernacular translations of Buddhist canonical literature. The work reflects mid-twentieth-century translation practices for sacred texts, balancing fidelity to original meanings with linguistic accessibility for modern audiences, while participating in broader projects recovering women's voices from historical religious traditions and demonstrating Indian languages' capacity for rendering sophisticated philosophical and devotional literature. As University of Bombay publication, the translation represents institutional academic engagement with Buddhist textual traditions and vernacular dissemination of specialized scholarly knowledge, bridging Sanskrit/Pali textual scholarship and Hindi literary-religious culture. Bhagwat, who also translated the Maha Vagga (Vinaya Pitaka) from Pali into Devanagari script (1944), exemplifies mid-century scholarly translators whose work enabled broader access to Buddhist primary sources during crucial period of Buddhist studies' modernization and Buddhist practice's democratization across India and globally.

# थेरीगाथा (Therigatha) - Hindi Translation

## Overview

N.K. Bhagwat's 1956 Hindi translation of the *Therigatha*, published by the University of Bombay, provides Hindi-reading audiences access to one of the most remarkable literary and religious documents from ancient India—the earliest known anthology of women's literature, composed by and about Buddhist nuns (therīs, "elder women") who achieved enlightenment (arahatship) during the early centuries of Buddhism. The 112-page translation renders into accessible Hindi prose and verse the 73 poems originally composed orally in Magadhi language between approximately the sixth and third centuries BCE, subsequently transmitted orally for several centuries, and eventually committed to writing in Pali around 80 BCE as part of the Khuddaka Nikaya (Collection of Short Texts) within the Sutta Pitaka of the Pali Canon.

The *Therigatha* occupies unique position in ancient Indian literature and Buddhist textual traditions. As collection documenting women's voices speaking about their own spiritual experiences, psychological struggles, social circumstances, and liberation, it provides historical evidence of women's religious subjectivity and authority largely absent from other ancient Indian sources. The poems range from brief single-stanza utterances to extended compositions, expressing diverse themes: renunciation of household life and social roles; struggles with desire, grief, and attachment; meditation experiences; joy in liberation; affirmations of spiritual equality; and defenses of women's capacity for enlightenment against skeptical or dismissive attitudes.

Bhagwat's 1956 translation appeared during watershed moment in Indian Buddhism's modern history. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar's mass conversion ceremony on October 14, 1956, in Nagpur, where he led approximately 400,000 Dalits in embracing Buddhism as liberation from caste oppression, marked dramatic Buddhist revival in the land of Buddha's birth. This event, combined with expanding archaeological discoveries at Buddhist sites, growing academic Buddhist studies programs in Indian universities, and post-independence re-evaluation of indigenous intellectual and spiritual traditions, created significant demand for accessible vernacular translations of Buddhist canonical literature. Bhagwat's work enabled Hindi speakers—particularly educated urban audiences and Buddhist practitioners—to engage directly with primary Buddhist texts without requiring knowledge of Pali or Sanskrit.

The translation represents institutional academic engagement with Buddhist textual scholarship. Published by the University of Bombay (now University of Mumbai), one of India's premier institutions with established departments of Philosophy, Sanskrit, and Pali studies, the work reflects universities' roles in disseminating scholarly knowledge beyond specialist academic circles through vernacular publications. Such translations bridged technical Pali scholarship—conducted in academic departments and research institutes—with broader Hindi literary and religious culture.

## The Original Text: Structure and Content

The *Therigatha* consists of 73 poems attributed to individual nuns, organized into sixteen chapters (nipatas) according to verse length: single verses (ekakanipata), verses in twos (dukanipata), verses in threes (tikanipata), and so forth up to verses in sixties and beyond. This structural organization, characteristic of the Khuddaka Nikaya's other verse collections, facilitates memorization and recitation while preserving each nun's individual composition.

The poems document experiences of women from remarkably diverse social backgrounds who joined the early Buddhist sangha. Some were born into noble or wealthy families; others came from merchant or artisan castes; several were former courtesans; some entered the sangha as widows seeking refuge after husbands' deaths; others left marriages and children to pursue religious life. This social diversity distinguishes early Buddhism's monastic community from contemporary Brahmanical institutions that restricted religious authority and learning to upper-caste males, and from other renunciant movements that primarily attracted men.

Several poems achieve considerable literary sophistication. The verses attributed to Subha Jivakambavanika (Therigatha 366-399), comprising 34 verses, present extended narrative describing a young nun's encounter with a lustful man who harasses her in a mango grove, her eloquent rejection of his advances through discourse on body's impermanence and sensual desire's dangers, and her affirmation of spiritual liberation's superiority to worldly pleasures. The poem demonstrates rhetorical skill, dramatic structure, and philosophical argumentation, revealing that these nuns possessed not merely spiritual realization but literary and intellectual capacities.

Other notable compositions include Mahapajapati Gotami's verses—the Buddha's aunt and foster-mother who became the first bhikkhuni (ordained Buddhist nun) and founder of the women's sangha. The former courtesan Ambapali's verses describe her youthful beauty's decline and her joyful renunciation of worldly life for spiritual freedom. The nun Mutta's brief verse celebrates liberation from domestic drudgery: freed from mortar and pestle, freed from husband, she attains nibbana (nirvana). These diverse voices collectively document women's complex experiences within patriarchal society and their paths to spiritual liberation.

The poems also engage theological and philosophical questions. Several nuns address skepticism about women's spiritual capacities, asserting that gender poses no obstacle to enlightenment—a remarkably progressive position for ancient India. Others describe meditative experiences, stages of spiritual development, and insights into impermanence (anicca), suffering (dukkha), and non-self (anatta)—Buddhism's three characteristics of existence. The verses thus function simultaneously as devotional literature, philosophical exposition, social documentation, and literary expression.

## Historical and Religious Significance

The *Therigatha* provides crucial historical evidence about early Buddhist monastic life and women's roles within it. The Buddha's establishment of the bhikkhuni sangha, following his initial reluctance and Mahapajapati Gotami's persistent request, represented unprecedented development in Indian religious history—the first formally organized women's monastic order with institutional structures, disciplinary codes (the Bhikkhuni Patimokkha containing 311 rules), and recognized spiritual authority.

The establishment of the bhikkhuni order reflects Buddhism's distinctive approach to women's spiritual capacities compared to contemporary Indian religious movements. While Brahmanical traditions generally excluded women from Vedic learning and religious authority, and Jain traditions accepted women renouncers but debated their capacity for achieving liberation in female bodies, early Buddhism formally recognized women's equal capacity for enlightenment and created institutional structures supporting their spiritual practice.

However, this recognition operated within complex constraints. The Buddha reportedly established eight special rules (garudhammas) subordinating bhikkhunis to bhikkhus (monks) in various institutional matters, generating ongoing debates about these rules' authenticity, historical development, and interpretation. The *Therigatha* poems themselves occasionally reference social prejudices, family opposition, and skepticism about women's religious capacities that nuns encountered, even while asserting their spiritual equality and achievements.

The text's preservation within the Pali Canon indicates the early Buddhist community's recognition of these women's spiritual authority and literary contributions. The *Therigatha* stands alongside its companion text, the *Theragatha* (Verses of Elder Monks), within the Khuddaka Nikaya, indicating institutional validation of women's voices and experiences as worthy of canonical status. This preservation contrasts with many other ancient Indian religious traditions where women's religious expressions, if they existed, were not preserved in canonical literature.

For women's history and feminist scholarship, the *Therigatha* provides exceptionally rare documentation of ancient women's subjectivity, agency, and self-expression. While most ancient Indian sources present women through male authors' perspectives—as idealized wives, dangerous temptresses, or absent presences—the *Therigatha* preserves women speaking about their own lives, struggles, desires, and liberations in their own voices. This makes the text invaluable for reconstructing women's experiences, religious participation, and self-understanding in ancient India.

## Buddhist Revival and Modern Translation

Bhagwat's 1956 translation emerged from specific mid-twentieth-century contexts. The Navayana Buddhist movement led by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, culminating in the mass conversion of October 1956, sought to reclaim Buddhism as egalitarian, rationalist alternative to Brahmanical Hinduism with its entrenched caste hierarchies. For this movement, accessible vernacular translations of Buddhist texts served crucial functions: enabling new Buddhist converts to learn Buddhist doctrine and practice; providing textual foundations for Buddhist identity and community formation; and demonstrating Buddhism's sophisticated intellectual and spiritual traditions.

The translation also reflected expanding academic Buddhist studies in Indian universities. Following independence, Indian academic institutions increasingly focused on indigenous intellectual traditions, including Buddhism's philosophical, ethical, and literary heritage. Universities established or expanded departments studying Pali, Buddhist philosophy, and Indian Buddhism's history. Scholars trained in these programs produced critical editions, translations, and analytical studies making Buddhist texts accessible to modern scholars and general readers.

The University of Bombay's publication of Bhagwat's translation indicates institutional support for Buddhist textual dissemination. N.K. Bhagwat, who earlier translated the *Maha Vagga* (Vinaya Pitaka) from Pali into Devanagari script (1944), exemplified scholars combining traditional Pali learning with modern translation practices, enabling broader access to Buddhist primary sources. His translations balanced scholarly fidelity to original texts with linguistic accessibility for Hindi readers, serving both academic audiences seeking reliable translations and general readers interested in Buddhist literature and spirituality.

The choice to translate the *Therigatha* specifically in 1956 may reflect emerging consciousness about women's voices in religious traditions. Mid-twentieth-century Indian nationalism and social reform movements increasingly addressed women's education, legal rights, and social status. Translating the *Therigatha*—Buddhism's canonical women's literature—contributed to recovering historical women's religious participation and challenging assumptions about women's roles in traditional religions.

## Comparative Translations and Scholarly Reception

The *Therigatha* has received significant attention from Buddhist studies scholars and translators internationally, particularly in recent decades as feminist scholarship has highlighted its importance for women's religious history. Multiple English translations exist, each reflecting different translation philosophies and scholarly approaches:

K.R. Norman's scholarly translation published by the Pali Text Society (1971) provides rigorous philological accuracy with extensive notes addressing linguistic complexities, textual variants, and interpretive questions, serving primarily academic audiences.

Susan Murcott's *The First Buddhist Women: Translations and Commentaries on the Therigatha* (1991) offers accessible poetic translations accompanied by background narratives drawn from commentarial literature, making the poems comprehensible to general readers while contextualizing each nun's circumstances.

Charles Hallisey's *Therigatha: Poems of the First Buddhist Women* (2015), published in Harvard University Press's Murty Classical Library of India series, presents facing-page Pali and English translation with scholarly introduction and notes, enabling readers to engage both the original language and poetic English rendering. Hallisey's translation received widespread critical acclaim, covered by major publications including *The New York Times* and *The New York Review of Books*, reflecting growing mainstream interest in Buddhist women's literature.

These multiple translations demonstrate the *Therigatha*'s continuing significance for diverse audiences: academic Buddhist studies scholars examining early Buddhist texts; feminist scholars documenting women's religious history; Buddhist practitioners seeking inspiration from early enlightened women; and general readers interested in ancient Indian literature and women's voices.

The existence of Bhagwat's 1956 Hindi translation alongside these English versions, plus translations into other Indian languages, indicates the text's importance across linguistic and cultural contexts. Each translation participates in ongoing projects making Buddhist canonical literature accessible beyond specialist Pali scholarship, enabling contemporary audiences to engage ancient Buddhist wisdom and women's spiritual testimonies.

## Contemporary Relevance and Preservation

For contemporary readers, the *Therigatha* offers multiple points of significance. As religious literature, it provides devotional inspiration and practical guidance from women who achieved enlightenment, demonstrating possibilities for spiritual liberation and offering models of Buddhist practice. As feminist text, it documents women's agency, authority, and self-expression in ancient religious context, challenging assumptions about women's historical silence and passivity. As poetry, it demonstrates sophisticated literary achievement by women authors from India's classical period. As historical source, it provides rare evidence about women's lives, social conditions, and religious participation in ancient India.

The digitization and online availability of Bhagwat's translation through the Digital Library of India, alongside other *Therigatha* editions available via Internet Archive, ensures continued access to this important Buddhist text. Digital preservation enables global audiences—particularly Hindi-speaking Buddhist communities and scholars—to engage this 1956 translation, while making it available for comparative translation studies, Buddhist textual scholarship, and women's religious history research.

The *Therigatha* continues to inspire contemporary Buddhist women practitioners globally. Bhikkhuni (women's monastic) ordination, which declined or disappeared in several Buddhist traditions over centuries, has experienced significant revival in recent decades, with women seeking ordination in Theravada, Tibetan, and East Asian Buddhist traditions. For these contemporary bhikkhunis, the *Therigatha* provides historical precedent and spiritual inspiration, connecting them to lineage of enlightened women reaching back to Buddhism's earliest centuries.

For feminist scholars and activists, the text demonstrates that women's religious authority, intellectual capability, and literary expression existed in ancient India despite patriarchal constraints, challenging narratives presenting women's subjugation as timeless or natural. The *Therigatha* shows women negotiating, resisting, and transcending social limitations through religious renunciation and spiritual achievement.

For students of Indian literature and religious studies, engaging the *Therigatha* through vernacular translations like Bhagwat's enables understanding of how sacred texts are transmitted, interpreted, and adapted across languages, historical periods, and cultural contexts, revealing translation's crucial role in religious traditions' preservation and transformation.
