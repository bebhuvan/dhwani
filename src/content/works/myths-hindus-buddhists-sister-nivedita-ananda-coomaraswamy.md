# Myths of the Hindus & Buddhists

This pioneering collaboration presents Hindu and Buddhist mythology to Western audiences through the unique partnership of Sister Nivedita's spiritual insights and Ananda Coomaraswamy's scholarly expertise. Published in 1913, this work represents an important early attempt to bridge Eastern spiritual traditions with Western understanding, making complex mythological narratives accessible while preserving their authentic cultural and religious significance.

## About the Authors

**Sister Nivedita** (Margaret Elizabeth Noble, 1867-1911) was an Irish-Scottish educator and social reformer who became one of Swami Vivekananda's most dedicated disciples. Her deep immersion in Indian spiritual life and direct experience of Hindu traditions provided her with unique insights into the cultural and spiritual dimensions of Indian mythology. Nivedita's commitment to interpreting Indian culture for Western audiences made her an ideal collaborator for this cross-cultural project.

**Ananda Coomaraswamy** (1877-1947) was a renowned metaphysician, art historian, and early interpreter of Indian culture to the West. His scholarly expertise in Indian philosophy, religious literature, and mythology, combined with his ability to present complex Eastern concepts in accessible Western terms, established him as one of the foremost authorities on Indian cultural traditions. Together, these authors created a work that combined spiritual authenticity with scholarly rigor.

## Significance

The work helped establish a foundation for comparative mythology and religious studies that influenced subsequent generations of scholars and spiritual seekers.

The authors' approach preserved the spiritual significance of these myths while making them comprehensible to Western readers, contributing to a broader appreciation of Eastern wisdom traditions during a crucial period of cultural exchange.
