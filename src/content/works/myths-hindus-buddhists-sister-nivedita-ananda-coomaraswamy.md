  "Myths of the Hindus & Buddhists" represents a seminal early 20th-century scholarly exploration of Indian mythological traditions, produced during a critical period of cultural translation and intellectual exchange between India and the West. Published in 1913 during the late colonial era, the work emerges from the collaborative scholarship of Sister Nivedita (Margaret Noble), an Irish-born disciple of Swami Vivekananda, and Ananda Coomaraswamy, a pioneering Ceylon-born art historian and cultural theorist. Their text meticulously unpacks complex Hindu and Buddhist mythological narratives, offering Western audiences a nuanced, scholarly interpretation of India's rich spiritual and symbolic traditions. Drawing from Sanskrit textual sources including the Puranas, Mahabharata, and Buddhist canonical texts, the work provides comprehensive analyses of fundamental mythological cycles, divine narratives, and metaphysical concepts. Coomaraswamy's rigorous scholarly methodology combined with Nivedita's intimate understanding of Indian spiritual philosophy enabled a profound hermeneutic approach that transcended mere literal translation. The work critically illuminates philosophical and symbolic dimensions of Indian mythology, exploring themes of cosmic order, divine intervention, human dharma, and spiritual transformation. By contextualizing mythological narratives within broader cultural and philosophical frameworks, Nivedita and Coomaraswamy challenged prevailing Orientalist representations and presented Indian spiritual traditions as sophisticated, intellectually complex systems of thought. Their collaborative scholarship significantly contributed to global understanding of Indian cultural heritage, establishing an important scholarly precedent for cross-cultural mythological interpretation and fostering deeper transnational intellectual engagement with Indian philosophical and religious traditions.

His scholarly expertise in Indian philosophy, religious literature, and mythology, combined with his ability to present complex Eastern concepts in accessible Western terms, established him as one of the foremost authorities on Indian cultural traditions. Together, these authors created a work that combined spiritual authenticity with scholarly rigor.
