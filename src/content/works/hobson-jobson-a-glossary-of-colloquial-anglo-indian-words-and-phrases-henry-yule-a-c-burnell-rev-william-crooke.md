*Hobson-Jobson: A Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases, and of Kindred Terms, Etymological, Historical, Geographical and Discursive* is a historical dictionary of Anglo-Indian words and terms from Indian languages that entered English during British rule in India. First published in 1886, the work was compiled by Sir Henry Yule (1820-1889), a Scottish orientalist, and Arthur Coke Burnell (1840-1882), an English Sanskrit scholar and member of the Madras Civil Service. The collaboration began in 1872 when Burnell, stationed in South India, particularly Thanjavur, wrote to Yule in Palermo about his collection of Anglo-Indian English usages. Yule suggested combining their parallel projects, and they worked together for fourteen years until Burnell's death in 1882. Yule completed the work, which was published four years later.

The dictionary contains over 2,000 entries documenting words that entered English from Arabic, Persian, Hindi, Sanskrit, Tamil, Chinese, and other Asian languages. Each entry includes etymological notes and citations from literary sources, some dating to the first European contact with the Indian subcontinent, frequently in non-English European languages. The work reads less as a conventional dictionary than as a memoir of colonial India, with entries covering places, people, occupations, celebrations, food, religions, and castes. Some entries span multiple pages, reflecting the encyclopedic ambitions of the compilers.

The title itself exemplifies the linguistic transformation the dictionary documents. "Hobson-Jobson" derives from the Anglicization of the Arabic-Urdu cry "Ya Hasan! Ya Husain!", the names of Hassan and Hussain, grandsons of the Prophet Muhammad, chanted during Shia Muharram processions commemorating the martyrdom of Hussain at Karbala. British soldiers, unfamiliar with the Arabic sounds, transformed the cry through successive corruptions: Hosseen Gosseen, Hossy Gossy, Hossein Jossen, and finally Hobson-Jobson. In Anglo-Indian usage, the term came to refer to any festival or entertainment, particularly Muharram ceremonies. Yule and Burnell selected this title as a "typical and delightful example" of the domestication process their dictionary examined, while also suggesting their dual authorship.

Notable entries include "bungalow" (from Hindi *bangla*, meaning "house in the Bengal style"), "jungle" (from Persian *jangal* via Sanskrit *jangala*, meaning "uncultivated land"), "loot" (from Hindi *lut*, possibly from Sanskrit *lotra*, meaning "booty"), "pundit," "juggernaut," "thug," "gymkhana," "pyjamas," "chutney," "verandah," and "dungarees." The etymologies reveal complex paths of transmission through multiple languages, reflecting centuries of cultural contact in South Asia.

William Crooke (1848-1923), an ethnographer and retired British Indian civil servant, edited the second edition published in 1903. Noticing in John Murray's catalogue that *Hobson-Jobson* had gone out of print, Crooke proposed writing a revised edition in February 1900. Murray accepted, and Crooke's edition appeared three years later with additional quotations and an index. This 1903 edition became the standard version, remaining in print and influencing subsequent lexicography.

The work profoundly influenced English lexicography. Sir James Augustus Henry Murray, primary editor of the *Oxford English Dictionary* from 1879 until his death, made extensive use of *Hobson-Jobson* when writing entries on South Asian words. The OED borrowed etymological information and historical examples of Asian loanwords directly from Yule and Burnell's compilation. The dictionary's methodology established precedents for documenting language contact and borrowing.

Literary culture embraced *Hobson-Jobson* as both reference work and cultural artifact. Tom Stoppard's play *Indian Ink* features characters playing a word game demonstrating the density of Anglo-Indian vocabulary: "While having tiffin on the verandah of my bungalow I spilled kedgeree on my dungarees and had to go to the gymkhana in my pyjamas looking like a coolie," answered by "I was buying chutney in the bazaar when a thug escaped from the choky and killed a box-wallah for his loot, creating a hullabaloo and landing himself in the mulligatawny." Salman Rushdie celebrated the dictionary in an essay, noting how words like "pundits, juggernaut, barbicans, loot, moguls, palanquins, cheroots, toddy, sherbet, verandas, gymkhana, memsahibs, thugs, bandanas, dungarees, pariahs and ghoulish" all appear with their Eastern etymologies in its pages.

The term "law of Hobson-Jobson" entered linguistic terminology to describe the phonological adaptation process by which loanwords conform to the phonology of the receiving language. This process, also called "folk etymology" or "phono-semantic matching," transforms foreign sounds into familiar patterns, as exemplified by the dictionary's own title.

Despite being over a century old, *Hobson-Jobson* remains the most comprehensive lexicographical treatment of Anglo-Indian vocabulary. While British English has the OED, American English the *Webster's*, and Australian English the *Macquarie Dictionary*, Indian English scholars must rely on this 1886-1903 work. Contemporary linguists recognize this gap: although Indian English ranks among the world's most important and widely-spoken English varieties, it lacks modern lexicographical documentation. Recent scholarship has called for moving "beyond Hobson-Jobson" toward twenty-first-century lexicography that adequately represents contemporary Indian English. Nevertheless, the dictionary continues to serve as an invaluable resource for understanding British India and the early history of European-Asian contact, documenting linguistic and cultural exchanges that shaped both English and South Asian languages.

The work exemplifies Victorian scholarly ambitions: comprehensive, anecdotal, historically grounded, and attentive to the complexities of cross-cultural encounter. Its enduring relevance stems not only from its documentary completeness but also from its recognition that language contact involves cultural transformation, power relations, and mutual influence. The words *Hobson-Jobson* documents entered English not through simple borrowing but through centuries of trade, administration, military service, and daily interaction between speakers of different languages. Each entry preserves this history, making the dictionary both a linguistic record and a chronicle of colonial contact.
