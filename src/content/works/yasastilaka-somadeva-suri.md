description: "Somadeva Suri's Yasastilaka represents Jain Sanskrit literature's supreme achievement in champu style (alternating prose and verse), blending romantic narrative with profound Jain philosophical instruction. Composed in 959 CE at the Western Chalukya court, this monumental work narrates the spiritual journey of prince Yashodhara through multiple rebirths, interweaving his romance with Srimati alongside extensive Jain doctrinal exposition on karma theory, cosmology, ethics, and liberation. The eight books progress from worldly life through renunciation to enlightenment, embedding within the narrative framework systematic presentations of Jain metaphysics, epistemology, and soteriology. Somadeva's literary virtuosity appears in ornate Sanskrit prose rivaling Banabhatta, sophisticated verse in multiple meters, and seamless integration of philosophical discourse with compelling storytelling. The 1916 Nirnayasagar Press edition preserves this masterwork demonstrating that Jain authors could achieve literary excellence while maintaining doctrinal orthodoxy and didactic purpose."
