# An Historical Disquisition Concerning the Knowledge Which the Ancients Had of India

## Overview
Scottish historian William Robertson set out in 1791 to collate what classical authors knew about the Indian subcontinent. The treatise compares testimony from Greek geographers, Roman merchants, Persian chroniclers, and early Christian writers, testing each against nautical evidence from the Red Sea and Arabian Sea. Robertson aims to explain how knowledge of India circulated along the spice trade routes centuries before Portuguese and British voyages.

## Highlights
Chapters reconstruct itineraries of Alexander the Great’s fleets, summarise descriptions of Indian governance found in Strabo and Arrian, and analyse the *Periplus of the Erythraean Sea* alongside later Arab navigation manuals. Robertson also surveys the diffusion of Buddhism and Hindu practice as reported by travellers, examining how commercial exchange brought textiles and precious stones to Mediterranean markets.

## Access Notes
The Internet Archive copy preserves the large-format maps and appendices printed with the first edition, including Robertson’s annotated timeline of trade contacts. High-resolution PDF and searchable text make it straightforward to trace individual classical citations.
