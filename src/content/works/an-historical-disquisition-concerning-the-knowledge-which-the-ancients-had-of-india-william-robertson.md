## Historical Context

William Robertson's "An Historical Disquisition Concerning the Knowledge Which the Ancients Had of India" represents a seminal scholarly exploration of cross-cultural historical understanding during the late 18th century Enlightenment period. As a prominent Scottish historian and leading intellectual of the Scottish Enlightenment, Robertson synthesized classical European textual sources to provide a comprehensive scholarly analysis of pre-colonial representations of Indian civilization. Published in 1791, the work emerges during a critical transitional moment in British-Indian intellectual engagement, when European scholars were systematically documenting and interpreting non-European civilizations through a comparative historical lens. Robertson meticulously examines Greco-Roman, Persian, and early Christian textual accounts, analyzing their descriptions of Indian geography, commercial practices, religious systems, and social structures. His methodology reflects the emerging comparative historiographical approaches of the period, critically examining ancient textual sources to construct a nuanced understanding of Indian cultural complexity. The disquisition is particularly significant for its scholarly rigor in interpreting classical representations, demonstrating how European intellectual traditions sought to comprehend Indian civilization through textual archaeological evidence. Robertson's work bridges classical scholarship with emerging colonial-era ethnographic methodologies, providing crucial insights into how European intellectual circles conceptualized and interpreted non-European societies during a transformative period of global intellectual exchange. By critically analyzing classical textual sources, Robertson contributed to developing more sophisticated, comparative approaches to understanding cultural difference, challenging simplistic colonial narratives and establishing methodological foundations for future cross-cultural historical scholarship.

# An Historical Disquisition Concerning the Knowledge Which the Ancients Had of India

## Overview
Scottish historian William Robertson set out in 1791 to collate what classical authors knew about the Indian subcontinent. The treatise compares testimony from Greek geographers, Roman merchants, Persian chroniclers, and early Christian writers, testing each against nautical evidence from the Red Sea and Arabian Sea. Robertson aims to explain how knowledge of India circulated along the spice trade routes centuries before Portuguese and British voyages.

## Highlights
Chapters reconstruct itineraries of Alexander the Great’s fleets, summarise descriptions of Indian governance found in Strabo and Arrian, and analyse the *Periplus of the Erythraean Sea* alongside later Arab navigation manuals. Robertson also surveys the diffusion of Buddhism and Hindu practice as reported by travellers, examining how commercial exchange brought textiles and precious stones to Mediterranean markets.

## Access Notes
The Internet Archive copy preserves the large-format maps and appendices printed with the first edition, including Robertson’s annotated timeline of trade contacts. High-resolution PDF and searchable text make it straightforward to trace individual classical citations.
