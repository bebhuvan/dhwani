# Purāṇic Encyclopaedia

## Overview

Vettam Mani's 942-page Purāṇic Encyclopaedia provides a comprehensive dictionary of characters, places, concepts, and stories from the Mahabharata and the eighteen major Puranas. Published by Motilal Banarsidass in 1975, this reference work systematizes the vast corpus of Hindu epic and Puranic literature into an alphabetically organized format, enabling readers to navigate mythology, genealogies, geographical locations, philosophical concepts, and narrative episodes. Originally composed in Malayalam over 14 years of research, the English version makes this scholarly compilation accessible to international audiences.

## About Vettam Mani

Vettam Mani (1921-1987) was an Indian scholar and writer who dedicated years to systematically studying and organizing Puranic literature. His encyclopaedia represents one individual's sustained effort to make the sprawling, often contradictory narratives of Puranic texts navigable through cross-referencing and systematic organization. The work demonstrates both deep familiarity with Sanskrit sources and pedagogical concern for making complex mythological traditions comprehensible.

## Scope and Content

The encyclopaedia covers:
- Characters from the Mahabharata and Puranas (gods, sages, kings, demons)
- Geographical locations (sacred places, kingdoms, mountains, rivers)
- Philosophical and religious concepts
- Genealogies of divine and royal lineages
- Episodes and stories cross-referenced across texts
- Rituals and religious practices
- Cosmological structures and time cycles

Entries range from brief identifications to extended summaries of complex narratives, with cross-references connecting related entries.

## The Puranic Corpus

The eighteen Mahapuranas (major Puranas) systematize Hindu mythology, cosmology, religious practice, and sacred history. Traditionally attributed to Vyasa, these texts were composed and compiled between approximately 300-1500 CE, incorporating earlier oral traditions. Each Purana typically contains five subjects (panchalakshana): creation, dissolution and recreation, genealogies, cosmic cycles, and dynastic histories.

The eighteen Mahapuranas include Brahma, Padma, Vishnu, Shiva, Bhagavata, Narada, Markandeya, Agni, Bhavishya, Brahma-vaivarta, Linga, Varaha, Skanda, Vamana, Kurma, Matsya, Garuda, and Brahmanda Puranas. Regional and sectarian variations exist, with some promoting Vishnu, others Shiva, and others the Goddess as supreme deity.

## Utility and Significance

This encyclopaedia serves multiple purposes:
- **Research Tool**: Scholars can quickly locate information about specific characters, places, or concepts across multiple texts
- **Teaching Resource**: Educators can reference specific mythological narratives and their variations
- **Comparative Study**: The cross-referencing enables comparison of how different Puranas treat the same stories
- **General Reference**: Readers unfamiliar with Puranic literature can access mythological information without reading entire texts

## Digital Preservation

This 942-page work has been digitized from the University of Toronto library and is freely accessible through the Internet Archive, providing scholars and students of Hindu mythology, Sanskrit literature, and comparative religion with access to this comprehensive reference tool.
