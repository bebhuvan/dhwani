description: "The Brahma Sutras represent Vedanta philosophy's foundational text, systematizing Upanishadic teachings on Brahman through approximately 555 cryptic aphorisms addressing ultimate reality's nature, world's relation to Brahman, individual self's status, meditation practices, and liberation path. Composed around 2nd century BCE and attributed to Badarayana (identified with Vyasa), this seminal work establishes Vedanta as systematic philosophy: reconciling apparently contradictory Upanishadic passages, refuting rival interpretations (Samkhya, Yoga, Buddhism, Jainism), and presenting coherent theological-philosophical framework. The sutras' extreme brevity and ambiguity enabled diverse interpretations, spawning major Vedantic schools—Shankara's Advaita (non-dualism), Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita (qualified non-dualism), Madhva's Dvaita (dualism)—each claiming authentic representation through detailed commentaries. Beyond sectarian divisions, the Brahma Sutras established systematic Upanishadic interpretation as legitimate philosophical enterprise, Vedanta as intellectually rigorous tradition engaging competitors rationally, and scriptural exegesis requiring logical consistency alongside textual fidelity, profoundly influencing Hindu philosophical-theological thought."
