# Puranas, or an Account of Their Contents and Nature

## Original Composition and 1897 Republication

Wilson's essay on the Puranas originated from his early Sanskrit scholarship during the 1830s when he held Oxford's first Sanskrit professorship. The work first appeared as an article surveying the eighteen Mahapuranas—major Hindu texts encyclopedic in scope covering cosmology, mythology, theology, and genealogies. The Society for the Resuscitation of Indian Literature, founded by Manmatha Nath Dutt in Calcutta, republished Wilson's essay in 1897 as part of its mission to make classical Indian texts and scholarship accessible to English-reading audiences. The Society, operating from 65/2 Beadon Street, Calcutta, specialized in publishing Sanskrit translations and scholarly studies, taking its name from Dadabhai Naoroji's call for "Resuscitation of India's own noble literature, modified and refined by the enlightenment of the West."

The 1897 edition appeared amid renewed Indian interest in classical Hindu literature following decades of colonial education emphasizing Western texts. Indigenous publishing ventures like Dutt's Society represented cultural nationalism asserting value of Sanskrit learning alongside modern education. Wilson's essay, written by a respected European Sanskritist, provided authoritative overview legitimizing Puranic literature's scholarly study while remaining accessible to general readers.

## Structure and Analytical Framework

Wilson organized his account by individual Purana, systematically examining each of the eighteen Mahapuranas recognized by traditional classification schemes. For each text, he addressed: classification as Vaishnava, Shaiva, or Brahma Purana based on predominant deity; narrative structure and major episodes; cosmological and genealogical content; theological orientations; and textual characteristics suggesting composition periods. This systematic treatment enabled comparative analysis across the corpus while providing reference information for readers encountering Puranic references in other Sanskrit literature.

The essay distinguished Puranas from Vedic literature and Itihasas (epics). While Vedas constituted revealed scripture (shruti) and epics like Mahabharata and Ramayana narrated heroic histories, Puranas combined cosmological speculation, mythological narratives, ritual prescriptions, and temple glorification (mahatmyas). Wilson emphasized Puranas' encyclopedic character: they incorporated materials on astronomy, medicine, law, pilgrimage, and local traditions alongside core mythological and theological content. This comprehensiveness made Puranas accessible sources for popular Hinduism's doctrines and practices, contrasting with Vedic texts' ritual specialization and philosophical Upanishads' abstract speculation.

Wilson addressed Puranic authorship traditions attributing texts to Vyasa while acknowledging scholarly consensus recognizing multiple authorship and accretion over centuries. He discussed dating problems, noting textual references to historical dynasties alongside mythological genealogies extending to impossible antiquity. His analysis suggested composition periods ranging from early centuries CE through medieval times, with different Puranas reflecting distinct theological schools and regional traditions.

## Survey of Individual Puranas

The essay treated major Puranas including: Vishnu Purana (which Wilson had separately translated), emphasizing Vaishnavite theology and Vishnu's avatars; Bhagavata Purana, focusing on Krishna mythology and devotional bhakti traditions; Shiva Purana and Linga Purana, articulating Shaivite theology; Brahma Purana, Brahmanda Purana, and Brahmavaivarta Purana representing Brahmanical perspectives; Markandeya Purana, containing Devi Mahatmya glorifying the Goddess; Matsya, Kurma, and Varaha Puranas named for Vishnu's animal avatars; Vamana, Skanda, Agni, Naradiya, Garuda, and Padma Puranas, each with distinctive theological emphases and legendary materials.

Wilson's descriptions identified characteristic features distinguishing each Purana. The Vishnu Purana's systematic organization and relative coherence contrasted with Skanda Purana's vast, fragmentary corpus incorporating regional temple legends. Bhagavata Purana's devotional poetry and elaborate Krishna narratives differed from Markandeya Purana's Goddess-centered theology. These distinctions enabled readers to navigate Puranic literature's diversity and select texts relevant to specific theological interests or research questions.

The essay documented Puranas' role in Hindu theological development. Puranic narratives elaborated doctrines of divine incarnations (avatara-vada), devotional worship (bhakti), and sectarian identities distinguishing Vaishnavas, Shaivas, and Shaktas. Temple construction, pilgrimage site glorification, and ritual procedures received extensive Puranic treatment, making these texts practical guides for religious practice alongside theological expositions. Wilson's analysis illuminated how Puranas functioned as authoritative sources for popular Hinduism beyond Brahmanical ritualism of older Vedic traditions.

## Contribution to Purana Studies

Wilson's essay provided Western scholarship its first systematic overview of Puranic literature. Earlier European encounters with Hinduism emphasized Vedas or philosophical texts like Bhagavad Gita, leaving Puranas relatively obscure despite their centrality to lived Hindu traditions. Wilson's survey demonstrated Puranas' significance for understanding Hindu mythology, theology, and religious practice, establishing their legitimacy as subjects for scholarly study.

The work influenced subsequent Purana scholarship. Wilson's translations and analytical observations set standards for European engagement with these texts, though later scholars revised his chronologies and theological interpretations. His emphasis on Puranas' diverse origins and accretive development anticipated modern textual criticism recognizing multiple compositional layers. The essay's accessibility made it valuable introduction for students beginning Purana studies, while its systematic coverage served reference function for scholars encountering Puranic allusions in other contexts.

Post-independence Indian scholarship built on Wilson's foundation while critiquing colonial-era assumptions. Indigenous scholars emphasized Puranas' role in preserving regional traditions and vernacular cultures alongside Sanskrit theological discourse. Wilson's work remained significant as early systematic treatment establishing Puranic studies within comparative religion and Indological research.

## Author and Context

Horace Hayman Wilson (1786-1860) began his Indian career as East India Company surgeon before pursuing Sanskrit studies under Calcutta pandits. His appointment as Oxford's first Boden Professor of Sanskrit (1832) established institutional presence for Sanskrit studies in British universities. Wilson's scholarship combined philological rigor with interest in Indian cultural and religious traditions, producing translations and analytical studies spanning Vedic texts, Puranas, dramatic literature, and inscriptions. His Vishnu Purana translation (1840) remained standard English version through the nineteenth century, while his Sanskrit-English dictionary served generations of students.

Wilson's Orientalist scholarship operated within colonial contexts but demonstrated respect for Sanskrit learning and Hindu traditions absent from evangelical critiques prominent in early nineteenth-century British India. His work supported educational curricula incorporating Sanskrit alongside classical Western languages, opposing utilitarian reforms seeking to eliminate Oriental studies. This positioning made his scholarship acceptable to both European academic audiences and Indian intellectuals seeking recognition for classical Indian learning within modern educational frameworks.

The Society for the Resuscitation of Indian Literature's 1897 republication connected Wilson's earlier scholarship to late nineteenth-century cultural nationalism. Manmatha Nath Dutt's prolific translation enterprise made major Sanskrit texts available in affordable English editions, serving Indian readers educated in English-medium schools seeking access to classical literary heritage. Publishing Wilson's authoritative overview alongside Dutt's Purana translations provided scholarly framework for approaching these texts, legitimizing their study while making them accessible beyond Sanskrit-reading specialists.
