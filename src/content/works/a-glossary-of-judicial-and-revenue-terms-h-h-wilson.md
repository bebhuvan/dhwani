# A Glossary of Judicial and Revenue Terms

## Overview
Commissioned by the Court of Directors of the East India Company, Wilson’s glossary consolidates terminology found in Persianate and vernacular records across colonial courts. The volume spells out linguistic roots, variant spellings, and institutional contexts, allowing officials to interpret deeds, farmans, and revenue registers with greater accuracy.

## Highlights
Entries accompany concise essays on procedural law, land tenure categories, and taxation systems, bridging Sanskritic, Persian, and regional vocabularies. Wilson often cites authoritative manuals and chronicles, embedding British administrative language within longer Indo-Islamic legal traditions.

## Access Notes
The University of Toronto digitisation includes reliable OCR and multiple download formats. Researchers can quickly search for unfamiliar terms encountered in archival manuscripts or cross-reference definitions while consulting translated court proceedings.
