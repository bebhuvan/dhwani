description: |
  This Portuguese-language poetic adaptation presents a profoundly moving episode from Valmiki's ancient Sanskrit epic, the Ramayana, translated and rendered into verse by Cândido de Figueiredo (1846-1925), one of Portugal's most distinguished philologists, lexicographers, and literary figures. The narrative centers on a tragic hunting accident that haunts King Dasharatha, father of the epic's hero Rama, throughout his life and ultimately determines the course of the Ramayana's central events. The episode recounts how young Prince Dasharatha, while hunting in the forest, hears movement near a riverbank and shoots an arrow at what he believes to be an animal drinking water. Instead, his arrow strikes and mortally wounds Yaginadatta, the devoted son of a blind hermit couple who had sent the boy to fetch water for them. The dying youth's anguished cries lead Dasharatha to discover his terrible mistake. Overcome with guilt and horror, the king attempts to comfort the suffering boy and then must face the heartbreaking task of informing Yaginadatta's elderly blind parents, who depend entirely on their son for survival. The narrative explores profound themes of unintended consequences, moral responsibility, karma, and the weight of actions that cannot be undone. The grieving father, devastated by his son's senseless death, pronounces a curse upon Dasharatha: just as the hermit now experiences the unbearable agony of losing his beloved child, so too shall Dasharatha one day die of grief over separation from his own son. This curse, pronounced in the depths of parental anguish, plants the seed for the epic's main narrative—Dasharatha's eventual death from grief when Rama is exiled to the forest for fourteen years. Figueiredo's rendering captures the episode's emotional intensity and philosophical depth, employing Portuguese poetic forms to convey the pathos of the original Sanskrit. As a renowned scholar of Portuguese language—his "Novo Dicionário da Língua Portuguesa" (1913) became a standard reference work—Figueiredo brought exceptional linguistic sensitivity to this translation work, demonstrating how Sanskrit epic narratives could be successfully adapted into Portuguese literary traditions. The work represents an important intersection of Portuguese and Indian literary cultures during the late nineteenth century, when European scholars increasingly engaged with Sanskrit texts. While Figueiredo is best known for his lexicographical achievements and contributions to Portuguese orthography, this poetic translation showcases his versatility as a literary artist and his appreciation for cross-cultural narrative traditions. The Yaginadatta episode, though brief within the vast Ramayana, exemplifies the epic's moral complexity—exploring how even righteous kings can commit terrible errors and how the karmic consequences of actions, intentional or accidental, inevitably manifest across time.
