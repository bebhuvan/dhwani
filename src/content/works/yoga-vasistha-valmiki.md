description: "The Yoga Vasistha represents Advaita Vedanta's most comprehensive and accessible exposition through narrative framework, presenting non-dualistic philosophy via sage Vasistha's instruction to Prince Rama addressing approximately 32,000 verses across six books. Composed between 6th-14th century CE (dates debated) and traditionally attributed to Valmiki, this monumental work employs storytelling pedagogy: embedded tales illustrating philosophical principles, dialogues addressing metaphysical questions, and progressive teaching moving from conventional understanding to ultimate realization. The text addresses consciousness as sole reality, world as mental projection, liberation through understanding reality's nature, and practical meditation achieving direct realization. Beyond abstract philosophy, the Yoga Vasistha presents sophisticated psychology analyzing mind's creative power, detailed phenomenology of consciousness states, and accessible spiritual path emphasizing understanding over ritual. The work influenced Hindu spirituality profoundly—Kashmir Shaivism, Neo-Vedanta, and modern teachers—while demonstrating Advaita philosophy's literary and pedagogical sophistication, proving non-dualism accessible through narrative art alongside technical treatises."
