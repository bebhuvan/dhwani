description: "Bharata Muni's Natyashastra stands as the ancient world's most comprehensive treatise on performing arts, encompassing drama, dance, music, stagecraft, and aesthetic theory. Composed between 200 BCE and 200 CE, this encyclopedic work of 6,000 sutras across 36 chapters systematizes Indian theatrical arts: dramatic genres and structures, acting techniques (abhinaya), emotional aesthetics (rasa theory), music theory (including ragas and talas), dance movements (karanas and angaharas), stage architecture, costume, makeup, and theater management. The foundational rasa-bhava theory—identifying eight primary emotions (bhavas) producing aesthetic experiences (rasas) in audiences—profoundly influenced all subsequent Indian artistic and literary traditions. Beyond technical instruction, the Natyashastra presents drama as fifth Veda accessible to all castes, legitimizing theatrical arts as sacred cultural practice. Manomohan Ghosh's English translation made this monumental text accessible to global scholarship on theater, aesthetics, and performance studies."
