  Kabir Granthavali, compiled and edited by Mataprasad Gupta in 1928, represents a pivotal scholarly intervention in documenting the literary and philosophical works of the 15th-century mystic poet Kabir Das. Emerging during the critical period of Indian literary scholarship and cultural preservation in the early 20th century, this compilation provides a comprehensive collection of Kabir's poetic compositions, primarily in the Bhakti and Sant traditions. The work encompasses Kabir's dohas (couplets), padas (verses), and spiritual reflections that critique contemporary religious orthodoxies and advocate for a syncretic spiritual understanding transcending sectarian boundaries. Gupta's meticulous scholarly approach in organizing and annotating these texts offers researchers unprecedented access to Kabir's complex linguistic and philosophical landscape, spanning Hindi, Braj, and Awadhi dialects. The Granthavali is particularly significant in illuminating the socio-religious dynamics of medieval North India, capturing Kabir's radical critique of both Hindu and Muslim religious establishments while promoting a universalist spiritual philosophy. By preserving these textual traditions, the compilation serves as a critical resource for understanding the intellectual and spiritual movements that challenged hierarchical social structures and religious exclusivism during the late medieval period. Scholars of Indian literature, religious studies, and cultural history find this work invaluable for analyzing the intersections of devotional poetry, social critique, and mystical philosophy. The Granthavali not only documents Kabir's revolutionary literary legacy but also provides nuanced insights into the complex intellectual and spiritual negotiations characteristic of the Bhakti movement in pre-colonial India.
