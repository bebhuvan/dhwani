# A Handbook of Some South Indian Grasses

## Overview

Published in 1921 by the Superintendent of the Government Press, Madras, this 318-page handbook represents the first systematic documentation of grass species in the South Indian plains. Authored by Rai Bahadur K. Rangachari of the Agricultural College, Coimbatore, with assistance from C. Tadulinga Mudaliyar, the work was priced at four and a half rupees and addressed persistent requests for grass identification from officers in the Agricultural and Forest Departments. The handbook emerged during an intensive phase of botanical documentation in early twentieth-century South India, alongside contemporaneous flora compilations by Fyson, Gamble, and Fischer.

The work deliberately focused on approximately one hundred grass species of wide distribution across the South Indian plains, excluding rarer grasses and those confined to hill regions. This selective approach reflected the authors' emphasis on economic utility, particularly for agricultural and pastoral applications. The handbook documented species critical to fodder production, grazing management, and soil conservation in regions experiencing demographic pressure and changing land-use patterns. In the preface, Rangachari articulated two prescient concerns that remain relevant to grassland ecology: the concept of "indigenous grasses" as distinct from introduced species, and observations regarding "deterioration of grasses" through overgrazing and trampling—early recognition of anthropogenic impacts on South Indian grasslands.

The handbook addressed practical deficiencies in agricultural knowledge, noting that despite widespread importation of foreign grasses and fodder plants by agriculturalists and cattle rearers, greater results could be achieved with less labor and expense through systematic attention to native grass species. This argument for indigenous botanical resources preceded later conservation frameworks by several decades.

## About the Authors

Diwan Bahadur Kadambi Rangachari (1868-1934) pursued his education at Madras Christian College, Pachaiappa's College (BA, 1890), and Presidency College (MA), before joining the Madras Museum as herbarium keeper in 1897. Working under ethnographer Edgar Thurston, Rangachari co-authored the monumental seven-volume *Castes and Tribes of Southern India* (1909), a foundational ethnographic reference that demonstrated his capacity for systematic documentation. He served as relieving superintendent of ethnography at the Madras Museum in 1901 and pioneered early sound recording technology, using wax-cylinder phonographs to document Nilgiri tribal songs. In 1902, Rangachari transitioned to Presidency College as senior assistant professor, later joining the Agricultural College, Coimbatore in 1909 to teach systematic botany. He attained the rank of Indian Agricultural Service and became a founding member of the Indian Botanical Society, serving as its president in 1922. In 1917, he presided over the botanical section of the Indian Science Congress at Bangalore, delivering an address on the flora of Tirunelveli district.

Chinnakavanam Tadulinga Mudaliyar (1878-1954) graduated from the Agricultural College, Coimbatore, subsequently serving as Assistant Lecturing and Systematic Botanist at the same institution. He held Fellowship of the Linnean Society (F.L.S.), the world's oldest active biological society, indicating international recognition of his taxonomic expertise. Mudaliyar later advanced to Principal of Coimbatore Agricultural College, demonstrating institutional progression from assistant botanist to administrative leadership. His botanical contributions extended beyond the grass handbook to include a 1932 publication on agricultural weeds. Mudaliyar's career also encompassed civic service; he served as Mayor of Madras from 1942 to 1943. The grass handbook brought Mudaliyar considerable acclaim as the first comprehensive treatment of South Indian Poaceae.

## The Work

**Scope and Methodology:**

The handbook employed a hierarchical taxonomic structure, providing keys for identification of genera and species accompanied by detailed descriptions of each taxon. Every species entry included illustrations depicting the whole plant habit, spikelet morphology, and flower details—critical diagnostic features for Poaceae identification. The authors prefaced species descriptions with a comprehensive general account covering vegetative organs (culms, leaves, rhizomes), floral structures (spikelets, florets, lemmas, paleas), and anatomical characteristics, including stem and leaf histology. This introductory material established a morphological foundation for subsequent species-level treatments.

The taxonomic descriptions emphasized characters observable in field conditions, making the handbook accessible to agricultural officers and forest personnel without specialized laboratory equipment. Species accounts integrated nomenclatural data, morphological descriptions, habitat preferences, and distributional information across South Indian districts. The volume documented vernacular names in Tamil and other regional languages, preserving local nomenclature that facilitated communication between botanical specialists and rural practitioners. This attention to indigenous terminology reflected Rangachari's ethnographic training and recognition of traditional ecological knowledge.

The work's geographic scope encompassed the plains regions of Madras Presidency and adjacent territories, excluding montane grasslands of the Western Ghats and Eastern Ghats. This lowland focus corresponded to areas of intensive agricultural activity and livestock grazing where grass identification held practical consequence for fodder management and pasture improvement.

**Practical Applications:**

The handbook addressed urgent agricultural concerns in colonial South India, where expanding human populations and livestock herds placed increasing pressure on natural grasslands. Rangachari emphasized that grasses constituted crucial elements of farming systems yet remained systematically neglected by practitioners. The handbook aimed to remedy this knowledge gap by enabling identification of nutritious fodder species, palatable pasture grasses, and soil-binding species useful for erosion control on agricultural lands.

Many documented species served multiple economic functions: as livestock feed, thatch material, soil stabilizers on bunds and field margins, and pioneer vegetation for degraded lands. The handbook's attention to indigenous species challenged prevailing assumptions that agricultural improvement required exotic germplasm, instead advocating selection and management of adapted native grasses. This perspective anticipated later agroecological approaches emphasizing locally-adapted crops and forages.

The work particularly targeted officers in Agricultural and Forest Departments responsible for pasture management, afforestation schemes, and agricultural extension. By providing identification tools and ecological information, the handbook enabled field personnel to assess grassland condition, recommend appropriate species for fodder production, and develop science-based grazing management strategies for pastoral communities.

## Significance

**Contemporary Reception:**

In 1922, *Nature* published a favorable review noting the handbook's comprehensive keys for genus and species identification, detailed descriptions accompanied by clear illustrations of whole plants, spikelets, and floral details. The reviewer commended the preliminary chapters on vegetative and reproductive morphology and stem and leaf anatomy as useful pedagogical material. While observing that some figures lacked complete sharpness, the review concluded that illustrations remained sufficiently clear for specimen identification and predicted the handbook would "prove of good service in South India." This endorsement from Britain's premier scientific journal established the work's credibility within the international botanical community.

The handbook found practical application in colonial administrative structures, serving as a reference for agricultural departments managing experimental farms, forestry services implementing grassland restoration programs, and revenue authorities assessing pasture resources. Its publication by the Government Press signaled official recognition of systematic botanical documentation as infrastructure for agricultural development.

**Later Assessment:**

The handbook established a baseline for twentieth-century South Indian grassland studies, providing nomenclatural standards and species inventories against which subsequent floristic surveys could be compared. Its documentation of grass distributions in 1921 enables historical ecological analysis of range shifts, local extinctions, and invasive species establishment over the past century. The work's attention to indigenous nomenclature preserves vernacular names that have disappeared from contemporary usage as traditional pastoral practices decline.

Subsequent botanical publications on South Indian grasses have consistently cited this handbook as a foundational reference, particularly for historical distribution records. The work's focus on economically important plains species complemented contemporary treatments of montane grasslands and specialized habitats, collectively establishing comprehensive documentation of South Indian Poaceae diversity during the early twentieth century.

**Value for Researchers:**

For historical botanists, the handbook provides insight into taxonomic concepts, nomenclatural usage, and field survey methodology during the late colonial period. Researchers investigating grassland ecology can extract baseline vegetation data for comparative analysis with modern surveys, documenting ecosystem changes over centennial timescales. The work's preservation of vernacular nomenclature offers material for ethnobotanical research, linguistic studies of botanical terminology, and investigations of traditional ecological knowledge systems.

Agricultural historians examining colonial-era scientific institutions, agronomic research priorities, and technology transfer mechanisms find the handbook illustrative of early twentieth-century approaches to agricultural improvement through systematic botany. The authors' emphasis on indigenous species over exotic germplasm represents an alternative trajectory in colonial agricultural science, diverging from transfer-of-technology models that dominated elsewhere. For contemporary conservation biology, the handbook documents historical grassland composition, providing context for restoration ecology initiatives and grassland biodiversity assessments in heavily modified South Indian landscapes.
