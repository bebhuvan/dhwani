## Historical Context and Publication

Joseph Davey Cunningham completed *A History of the Sikhs* in 1849, shortly after the British annexation of Punjab following the Second Anglo-Sikh War. An East India Company political agent who had served in various capacities in Punjab during the 1840s, Cunningham witnessed firsthand the collapse of Maharaja Ranjit Singh's empire and the subsequent British conquest. His work was the first comprehensive English-language history of Sikhism and the Sikh people, written during a period when British administrators were attempting to understand the region they had just acquired. The 1918 edition represents a reprint of this foundational text, reflecting continued scholarly and administrative interest in Sikh history during the colonial period.

Cunningham's sympathetic portrayal of Sikh resistance to British expansion proved controversial. The East India Company directors, displeased with his relatively favorable treatment of Sikh military prowess and political organization, dismissed him from service in 1849. This professional consequence paradoxically enhanced the work's credibility among later scholars as evidence of its relative objectivity within the constraints of colonial historiography.

## Content and Structure

The work is organized chronologically, beginning with the life and teachings of Guru Nanak (1469-1539) and the theological foundations of Sikhism. Cunningham examines each of the ten Gurus in succession, analyzing the evolution of Sikh religious practice and community organization. Particular attention is devoted to Guru Gobind Singh's creation of the Khalsa in 1699, which Cunningham interprets as a transformative moment that militarized the Sikh community and established its distinctive identity markers.

The second major section addresses the 18th century, covering the Sikh misls (confederacies) that emerged following Mughal decline, their conflicts with Afghan invaders, and the consolidation of power under Ranjit Singh (1780-1839). Cunningham provides detailed analysis of Ranjit Singh's administrative innovations, military modernization, and diplomatic relations with the British.

The final section chronicles the succession crisis following Ranjit Singh's death, the First Anglo-Sikh War (1845-46), and the Second Anglo-Sikh War (1848-49). Cunningham includes extensive military analysis, drawing on his personal knowledge of the battles and access to British military records. He also incorporates translations from Persian court chronicles and Punjabi sources, making primary source material accessible to English readers.

## Significance and Impact

Cunningham's work established the chronological and interpretive framework that shaped subsequent Sikh historiography for decades. His reliance on Persian sources and British military records was later critiqued, but his attempt to incorporate Sikh perspectives represented a methodological advance over earlier dismissive British accounts. The work's detailed treatment of Sikh religious development influenced later scholars attempting to understand the relationship between Sikh theology and political organization.

For Sikh communities, the text occupied an ambiguous position—written by a colonial administrator yet demonstrating unusual respect for Sikh military achievement and cultural autonomy. Twentieth-century Sikh historians both criticized Cunningham's colonial perspective and acknowledged his role in establishing Sikh history as a subject worthy of serious scholarly attention.

## Author and Background

Joseph Davey Cunningham (1812-1851) served as a political agent in various Punjab territories during the 1840s. His linguistic abilities in Persian and Punjabi, combined with extensive travel throughout the region, provided him access to sources unavailable to most British observers. His dismissal from the East India Company following the book's publication effectively ended his career in India, though he continued writing on Indian subjects until his early death in 1851.
