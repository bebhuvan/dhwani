description: |
  Francis William Bain's 1903 narrative presented as a translation from ancient Sanskrit manuscript, weaving Hindu mythology, solar symbolism, and themes of love, pride, and karmic consequence. The work follows Kamalamitra, a spirit king seeking a wife of transcendent beauty, and Anushayini, the divine woman he discovers beside a lotus pond. When pride leads Kamalamitra to test whether a powerful sage can resist her allure, the offended sage curses the couple to cycles of reincarnation and suffering "until one slays the other." The narrative explores how actions motivated by ego generate karmic debts resolved across lifetimes. Bain, Professor of History at Deccan College Poona (1892-1919), developed deep familiarity with Sanskrit literature and Hindu traditions. However, contemporary scholars recognize his "translations" were largely imaginative creations inspired by Sanskrit conventions rather than faithful renderings of existing manuscripts—generating controversy regarding authenticity. Despite this ambiguity, Bain's works captivated Western audiences fascinated by Indian spirituality, combining Victorian literary sensibilities with Hindu metaphysical concepts. "The Descent of the Sun" employs solar mythology as framework for exploring cyclical time, earthly attachments, and transcendence. The work's enduring interest lies in its historical significance as a cultural artifact revealing how Hindu traditions were interpreted and romanticized for Western consumption during the colonial period, representing early fantasy literature inspired by Indian sources.
