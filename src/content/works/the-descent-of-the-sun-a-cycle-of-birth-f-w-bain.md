description: |
  This enchanting narrative, presented by Francis William Bain (1863-1940) as a translation from an ancient Sanskrit manuscript, weaves together Hindu mythology, solar symbolism, and themes of love, pride, and karmic consequence into a distinctive literary creation that captivated early twentieth-century readers. Originally published in 1903 by J. Parker in London, with subsequent editions by Philip Lee Warner in 1913 and 1917, the work represents Bain's second contribution to what would become a controversial series of "translations from Sanskrit manuscripts" that blended genuine knowledge of Hindu traditions with considerable creative embellishment. The narrative follows Kamalamitra, a young spirit king who performs intense spiritual penance seeking a wife of transcendent beauty, and Anushayini, the divine woman he eventually discovers beside a lotus pond. Their union, however, becomes shadowed by pride when Kamalamitra boastfully challenges his friend to witness Anushayini's unparalleled beauty. In a moment of foolish hubris, they approach a powerful sage to test whether even he can resist her allure. This act of pride triggers devastating consequences—the sage, offended by their presumption, pronounces a terrible curse condemning the couple to cycles of reincarnation and suffering "until one slays the other." What follows explores the unfolding of this curse through successive births, examining how actions motivated by ego and pride generate karmic debts that must be resolved across lifetimes. Bain, who served as Professor of History at Deccan College in Poona (Pune) from 1892 to 1919, developed deep familiarity with Sanskrit literature and Hindu philosophical traditions during his tenure in India. His works demonstrate genuine appreciation for Indian storytelling techniques, religious concepts like karma and reincarnation, and the symbolic language of Hindu mythology. However, contemporary scholars recognize that Bain's "translations" were largely his own imaginative creations inspired by Sanskrit literary conventions rather than faithful renderings of existing manuscripts. This creative approach generated significant controversy during his lifetime, with critics questioning the authenticity of his purported Sanskrit sources. Despite—or perhaps because of—this ambiguity, Bain's works found substantial readership among Western audiences fascinated by Indian spirituality and exotic romance. His narratives combined Victorian literary sensibilities with Hindu metaphysical concepts, creating hybrid works that satisfied Orientalist appetites for Eastern mysticism while remaining accessible to readers unfamiliar with actual Sanskrit texts. "The Descent of the Sun" exemplifies this synthesis, employing solar mythology—the sun's descent representing divine manifestation in earthly form—as framework for exploring cyclical time, spiritual consequences of earthly attachments, and the possibility of transcendence through suffering and understanding. The work's enduring interest lies not in its dubious claims to authenticity but in its historical significance as a cultural artifact revealing how Hindu traditions were interpreted, adapted, and romanticized for Western consumption during the British colonial period. Today, Bain's works are recognized as early examples of fantasy literature inspired by Indian sources, occupying a curious position between genuine cross-cultural literary exchange and Orientalist appropriation.
