  Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan's "Religion and Culture" (1932) emerged during a pivotal period in his philosophical career, appearing alongside his more widely known "An Idealist View of Life" (also 1932, based on his 1929 Hibbert Lectures) as part of his sustained engagement with tensions between religious tradition and modern scientific civilization. The work addresses fundamental questions confronting twentieth-century religious thought: whether scientific rationalism renders religious belief obsolete, how diverse religious traditions relate to universal truth claims, and whether spiritual values can inform modern culture without regressing into dogmatic fundamentalism. Written during Radhakrishnan's tenure as George V Professor of Philosophy at Calcutta University (1921-1931) and shortly before his appointment to Oxford's Spalding Chair of Eastern Religions and Ethics (1936-1952), the essays synthesize his mature philosophical position grounding religious pluralism in Advaita Vedanta's non-dualistic metaphysics while engaging Western critiques of religion from positivism, empiricism, and scientific materialism. Radhakrishnan argues that authentic religion represents empirical knowledge grounded in direct spiritual experience—what he terms "integral intuition"—rather than dogmatic belief systems requiring blind faith, positioning scriptures as "scientific records of spiritual insights" subject to experiential verification analogous to scientific methodology. This epistemological strategy responds to modern critiques by accepting empiricist premises while expanding legitimate evidence to include contemplative and mystical experience, thereby defending religious knowledge without retreating to fideism or scriptural literalism. The work examines relationships between religion and culture across civilizations, particularly contrasting Indian approaches emphasizing spiritual transcendence with Western tendencies toward institutional religion and materialist values. Radhakrishnan develops his characteristic argument that apparent religious diversity reflects varying cultural expressions of universal spiritual experience, with different traditions representing complementary perspectives on ultimate reality rather than mutually exclusive truth claims. He positions Indian philosophy, particularly Vedantic non-dualism, as uniquely suited to modern conditions because its experiential orientation and metaphysical inclusivity enable integration of scientific knowledge and religious wisdom without forcing artificial conflicts. The essays address specific themes including the crisis of modern civilization arising from scientific advancement absent spiritual values, the message of Jainism (particularly Mahavira's teachings) emphasizing non-violence and many-sidedness of truth, and the Asian conception of human nature contrasting with Western individualism. Radhakrishnan's treatment reflects his broader civilizational project: defending Indian religious traditions against colonial characterizations of Hinduism as irrational superstition while simultaneously reforming those traditions by emphasizing philosophical rather than ritualistic dimensions, universal ethics over caste hierarchy, and experiential spirituality rather than sectarian dogma. His approach exemplified what scholars identify as "Neo-Vedanta"—modern reformulations of Advaita Vedanta incorporating Western philosophical categories and responding to colonial critiques while claiming transhistorical authenticity. The work demonstrates both the strengths and limitations of this strategy: successfully establishing religious experience as legitimate knowledge domain while potentially essentializing both "East" and "West" into homogeneous categories, defending spiritual values while sometimes minimizing legitimate conflicts between scientific and religious worldviews, and articulating sophisticated philosophical theology that risked remaining accessible primarily to educated elites rather than addressing popular religious practice. Published during the global economic depression and rising totalitarianism, Radhakrishnan's emphasis on spiritual foundations for civilization represented philosophical response to widespread sense that Western modernity's material progress had failed to deliver human fulfillment or prevent catastrophic conflict. His argument that authentic culture requires spiritual dimensions alongside economic and political development influenced postcolonial Indian intellectual discourse, contributing to frameworks positioning Indian civilization as spiritually superior even while materially disadvantaged, a formulation enabling both anti-colonial critique and potential evasion of urgent material inequalities and social injustices requiring political rather than purely spiritual remedies.

## Publication Context and Philosophical Significance

"Religion and Culture" appeared in 1932, the same year as Radhakrishnan's more celebrated "An Idealist View of Life" (his 1929 Hibbert Lectures), marking a period of extraordinary philosophical productivity as he consolidated positions that would define his international reputation. The early 1930s represented a critical juncture for religious philosophy globally: logical positivism proclaimed metaphysical statements meaningless, scientific materialism claimed exclusive epistemological authority, and economic depression combined with political extremism challenged liberal faith in rational progress. In this context, Radhakrishnan's work defended religion's cognitive legitimacy and cultural necessity against reductionist critiques while simultaneously reforming religious traditions to align with modern values including rationality, tolerance, and individual freedom. His position at Calcutta University's George V Chair (1921-1931) had established him as India's foremost philosophical voice, while his 1929 Hibbert Lectures at Oxford demonstrated his capacity to engage Western academic audiences on equal terms, challenging colonial assumptions about Indian intellectual inferiority. "Religion and Culture" extends arguments developed across his career: that religious experience constitutes valid empirical knowledge, that apparent religious diversity masks underlying unity, and that spiritual values must inform civilization to prevent material advancement from producing moral catastrophe. The work addressed both Western and Indian audiences, defending religious worldviews against scientific materialism while advocating reformed, philosophical religion transcending sectarian divisions—a dual project reflecting Radhakrishnan's positioning as cultural mediator between colonizer and colonized, tradition and modernity, East and West.

## Epistemology of Religious Experience: Integral Intuition

Radhakrishnan's central philosophical innovation involved grounding religious knowledge in direct experience rather than revelation, scripture, or institutional authority, thereby responding to modern empiricism on its own terms while expanding legitimate evidence beyond sense perception. He developed the concept of "integral intuition"—immediate, non-conceptual apprehension of reality transcending subject-object duality—as the foundation for religious insight, positioning mystical experience as epistemologically authoritative rather than merely subjective emotion or cultural construction. This approach accepted empiricist premises that knowledge requires experiential grounding while arguing that contemplative disciplines cultivate perceptual capacities revealing dimensions of reality inaccessible to ordinary consciousness or instrumental reason. Radhakrishnan characterized scriptures as "scientific records of spiritual insights," suggesting that Vedic rishis and other mystics documented experiential discoveries analogous to scientific observations, making religious texts empirical reports rather than arbitrary beliefs. He insisted that spiritual claims remain subject to verification through contemplative practice, arguing that just as scientific hypotheses require experimental confirmation, religious propositions demand testing through disciplined meditation and ethical cultivation producing direct insight. This epistemological framework enabled him to defend religious knowledge against positivist critiques while maintaining commitment to reason and evidence, positioning religion as experiential discipline rather than dogmatic system. However, critics identified tensions in this approach: the privacy of mystical experience complicates intersubjective verification central to scientific methodology, the interpretive frameworks shaping religious experience may reflect cultural construction rather than unmediated reality, and Radhakrishnan's privileging of non-dualistic Vedantic interpretations potentially imposed philosophical preferences on diverse experiential reports. His epistemology nevertheless influenced religious studies by legitimating contemplative experience as research methodology and phenomenological description as valid philosophical approach, contributing to academic interest in mysticism and comparative religious experience transcending theological dogma.

## Religious Pluralism and Universal Spirituality

The work advances Radhakrishnan's distinctive approach to religious diversity, arguing that different traditions represent culturally-conditioned expressions of universal spiritual experience rather than conflicting truth claims requiring adjudication. This pluralist framework positioned religious differences as complementary perspectives on reality's multifaceted nature, using the Jain concept of anekantavada (many-sidedness) to suggest that each tradition captures authentic but partial insights that together constitute comprehensive understanding. Radhakrishnan distinguished between religion's eternal essence—direct spiritual experience and its universal ethical implications including compassion, truthfulness, and self-transcendence—and contingent historical forms including rituals, doctrines, and institutional structures reflecting particular cultural contexts. He argued that religious conflict arises from confusing these levels, mistaking historically-conditioned expressions for absolute truth and defending cultural particulars rather than recognizing underlying spiritual unity. This framework enabled him to affirm all religious traditions as valid while maintaining that some expressions more adequately capture universal essence, positioning Advaita Vedanta as "religion itself in its most universal and deepest significance" because its non-dualistic metaphysics and experiential orientation transcend sectarian limitations. His pluralism responded to both colonial critiques characterizing Hinduism as polytheistic confusion and Hindu nationalist claims of exclusive superiority, instead presenting Indian philosophy as uniquely equipped to integrate diverse perspectives through inclusive rather than exclusivist logic. However, this approach generated ongoing debates: whether his universalism genuinely respected religious particularity or subtly subordinated all traditions to Vedantic categories, whether privileging mystical experience marginalized prophetic, ethical, or communal dimensions of religion, and whether his emphasis on spiritual unity minimized legitimate theological disagreements and power relations shaping religious history. Contemporary scholars recognize both the generosity in Radhakrishnan's pluralism—genuinely affirming religious diversity rather than demanding conversion—and its limitations in imposing Hindu philosophical frameworks on traditions with different self-understandings and potentially obscuring material and political conflicts by emphasizing spiritual harmony.

## Critique of Modern Civilization and Scientific Materialism

"Religion and Culture" develops Radhakrishnan's diagnosis of modern civilization's spiritual crisis, arguing that Western emphasis on scientific rationality, technological mastery, and material acquisition produced unprecedented power without corresponding wisdom, generating environmental destruction, social alienation, and catastrophic warfare. He distinguished between legitimate scientific methodology—empirical investigation of natural phenomena—and illegitimate scientism—the claim that scientific knowledge exhausts reality and material explanations suffice for human existence. Radhakrishnan argued that reducing human beings to biological mechanisms or social constructions denied the spiritual dimensions constituting our deepest identity and highest potentials, producing nihilistic despair or hedonistic materialism incapable of generating meaning or purpose. He characterized Western modernity as fragmenting consciousness through extreme specialization, separating intellect from emotion, reason from intuition, individual from community, and humanity from nature, thereby losing the integral vision enabling harmonious existence. In contrast, he presented Indian philosophy, particularly Vedanta, as maintaining holistic understanding integrating material and spiritual, rational and mystical, individual and cosmic dimensions into unified worldview. This civilizational critique combined anti-colonial politics—challenging Western claims to civilizational superiority by diagnosing European culture's spiritual bankruptcy—with philosophical argument that materialist metaphysics inadequately accounts for consciousness, values, and meaning. Radhakrishnan proposed that authentic culture required balancing material and spiritual development, technological capacity and moral wisdom, individual freedom and communal solidarity. However, his critique risked several problems: essentializing "East" as spiritual and "West" as material reproduced orientalist categories even while reversing their valuations, potentially romanticizing premodern Indian society while minimizing its hierarchies and oppressions, and emphasizing spiritual solutions potentially deflected attention from economic exploitation and political domination requiring structural transformation rather than merely attitudinal change. His diagnosis nevertheless anticipated contemporary critiques of consumer capitalism, environmental degradation, and technologically-mediated alienation, contributing to ongoing debates about whether modernity requires supplementation by recovered spiritual wisdom or fundamental restructuring of material conditions and power relations.

## The Message of Mahavira and Jain Philosophy

The work includes substantial treatment of Jainism, particularly Mahavira's teachings, as exemplifying religious principles addressing modern challenges including violence, dogmatism, and environmental destruction. Radhakrishnan emphasized Jain commitment to ahimsa (non-violence) as comprehensive ethical orientation extending beyond refraining from physical harm to cultivating respect for all life and minimizing injury through thought, speech, and action. He positioned this principle as urgently relevant to twentieth-century conditions marked by mechanized warfare, imperial exploitation, and technological devastation of natural world, arguing that survival required replacing competitive, dominating relationships with cooperative, harmonious engagement. Radhakrishnan also highlighted Jain epistemology, particularly anekantavada (many-sidedness) and syadvada (conditional assertion), as philosophical resources for religious tolerance and intellectual humility. These doctrines acknowledge reality's complexity, recognizing that different perspectives capture authentic but partial truths, and that dogmatic claims to absolute knowledge betray intellectual arrogance and generate conflict. He suggested that Jain logical sophistication demonstrated Indian philosophy's rational rigor, countering colonial characterizations of Hindu thought as mystical irrationalism while providing frameworks for contemporary pluralism acknowledging diverse valid viewpoints without collapsing into relativism. His interpretation of Jainism exemplified his broader strategy of retrieving Indian philosophical resources to address modern problems, demonstrating that traditional teachings offered practical wisdom rather than merely historical curiosities. However, Radhakrishnan's presentation tended toward philosophical abstraction potentially minimizing Jainism's distinctive features including its elaborate metaphysics, monastic practices, and ritual traditions, instead emphasizing principles compatible with his universalist vision. Contemporary Jain scholars note that while Radhakrishnan increased international awareness of Jain philosophy, his interpretation sometimes subordinated Jain specificity to broader Vedantic frameworks, illustrating recurring tensions between honoring religious particularity and pursuing universal synthesis.

## Asian View of Man: Spiritual Anthropology

The work contrasts Asian conceptions of human nature emphasizing spiritual essence and cosmic interconnection with Western models stressing individual autonomy and material existence. Radhakrishnan argued that Western anthropology, rooted in Greco-Roman rationalism and Judeo-Christian theology, conceived humans as separate from nature—either rational souls transcending material creation or biological organisms competing for resources—producing alienation from natural world and spiritual dimensions. In contrast, he presented Asian perspectives, particularly Hindu and Buddhist philosophy, as understanding human beings as manifestations of ultimate reality temporarily individuated but fundamentally continuous with cosmic consciousness. This view positioned individual existence as stage in spiritual evolution toward self-realization, recognizing essential identity with Brahman or achieving nirvana through overcoming illusory separation. Radhakrishnan emphasized that this spiritual anthropology generated different ethical orientations: where Western individualism prioritized rights, autonomy, and self-interest potentially legitimating exploitation and conflict, Asian interconnectedness emphasized duties, compassion, and collective welfare conducive to harmonious coexistence. He argued that modern crises—environmental destruction, social fragmentation, existential meaninglessness—reflected Western anthropology's inadequacy, requiring recovery of spiritual understanding recognizing human participation in sacred cosmos rather than mere instrumental relationship with material resources. This civilizational contrast served both defensive and constructive purposes: challenging colonial claims that Christian theology or Enlightenment humanism represented superior worldviews, and proposing that Indian philosophy offered resources for addressing modernity's failures. However, contemporary scholars recognize limitations in Radhakrishnan's binary contrasts: substantial diversity exists within both "Asian" and "Western" traditions defying simple generalizations, his interpretations sometimes romanticized Indian society while ignoring caste oppression and gender hierarchy, and his emphasis on spiritual essence potentially minimized legitimate concerns with material welfare and social justice requiring political rather than purely philosophical responses. Nevertheless, his anthropological vision influenced subsequent comparative philosophy and cross-cultural dialogue, contributing to frameworks questioning Western assumptions about human nature while recognizing religious and cultural plurality.

## Influence and Legacy in Religious Studies

"Religion and Culture" contributed significantly to twentieth-century religious studies by defending religion's intellectual legitimacy during a period of aggressive secularization while reforming religious thought to accommodate modern values. Radhakrishnan's epistemological approach—grounding religious knowledge in experiential evidence subject to contemplative verification—influenced phenomenological and experiential approaches to religious studies, legitimating mysticism and meditation as research methodologies rather than merely belief systems. His religious pluralism anticipated subsequent interfaith dialogue and comparative theology, providing frameworks for affirming diversity without relativism or imperialism. The work exemplified broader Neo-Vedanta movement reformulating Hindu philosophy in conversation with Western thought, establishing patterns influencing subsequent Indian intellectuals including Aurobindo Ghose and contemporary figures like Raimon Panikkar. Radhakrishnan's international prominence—demonstrated through prestigious academic appointments and diplomatic service—helped establish Indian philosophy as legitimate academic discipline rather than merely orientalist curiosity, creating institutional space for non-Western philosophical traditions in Western universities. His influence extended beyond academia to broader cultural discourse about science and religion, modernity and tradition, contributing to frameworks positioning spiritual values as essential supplements to technological civilization. However, his legacy remains contested: defenders credit him with sophisticated philosophical defense of religion and pioneering interfaith understanding, while critics argue his elite philosophical idealism inadequately addressed structural inequalities, his universalism imposed Hindu categories on diverse traditions, and his emphasis on spiritual harmony potentially obscured legitimate theological conflicts and material politics. Contemporary reassessments recognize both his substantial contributions to comparative philosophy and religious pluralism, and the limitations of approaches emphasizing spiritual essence over particular traditions, mystical experience over embodied practice, and philosophical synthesis over political transformation. His work continues inspiring scholars seeking to articulate religious worldviews engaging modern rationality while generating critical examination of universalist claims and civilizational binaries shaping comparative religious thought.

## About Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan

**Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan** (1888-1975) emerged as twentieth-century India's most internationally prominent philosopher, achieving distinction as both academic intellectual and political statesman. Born into a Telugu Brahmin family in Tiruttani, Madras Presidency, Radhakrishnan received Christian missionary education before pursuing philosophy at Madras Christian College, where his 1908 M.A. thesis defending Vedanta against Western criticisms established his lifelong project of articulating Indian philosophy's contemporary relevance. His academic career proceeded through philosophy chairs at Mysore University (1918), Calcutta University's prestigious King George V Chair (1921-1931), and Oxford University's Spalding Chair of Eastern Religions and Ethics (1936-1952), making him the first Indian to hold major Western philosophical appointments. His major works—"Indian Philosophy" (two volumes, 1923-1927), "The Hindu View of Life" (1927), "An Idealist View of Life" (1929), and "Eastern Religions and Western Thought" (1939)—established international reputation while shaping Western understanding of Hinduism and Vedanta. Radhakrishnan's philosophical project synthesized Advaita Vedanta's non-dualistic metaphysics with Western idealism, developing concepts of "integral experience" and religious pluralism that positioned mystical intuition as authoritative knowledge transcending rational analysis while remaining subject to philosophical verification. His political career included serving as India's ambassador to the Soviet Union (1949-1952), Vice President (1952-1962), and President (1962-1967), embodying the philosopher-statesman ideal. As Vice Chancellor of Benares Hindu University (1939-1948) during the critical transition from colonial to independent India, he directly influenced educational policy while articulating visions of spiritually-grounded democracy and cultural nationalism that shaped postcolonial Indian identity. His birthday (September 5) is celebrated as Teachers' Day in India, reflecting his iconic status in Indian educational discourse. Contemporary scholarship increasingly examines the ambivalences in Radhakrishnan's thought—his reproduction of orientalist categories even while challenging Western supremacy, his elite Brahminical interpretations marginalizing subaltern perspectives, his philosophical idealism potentially obscuring material politics—while acknowledging his profound influence on twentieth-century Indian philosophy, education, and international understanding of Hindu traditions.
