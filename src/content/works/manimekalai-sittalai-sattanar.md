description: "The Manimekalai represents Tamil literature's premier Buddhist epic and sequel to Silappatikaram, narrating courtesan's daughter Manimekalai's spiritual journey from worldly beauty to Buddhist enlightenment. Composed around 6th century CE by Buddhist merchant-poet Sittalai Sattanar, this philosophical epic of 30 cantos explores Buddhist doctrine through narrative: renunciation's necessity, karma's operation, compassion toward all beings, and nirvana as liberation from suffering's cycle. The story follows Manimekalai, daughter of courtesan Madhavi (from Silappatikaram) and merchant Kovalan, who despite extraordinary beauty and suitor Prince Udayakumaran's persistent pursuit, feels drawn to Buddhist path through divine intervention. After supernatural experiences, philosophical instruction from goddess Manimekalai and Buddha's footprint shrine, and debate with adherents of rival philosophies (Shaiva, Jain, materialist), she achieves enlightenment renouncing worldly existence. Beyond religious instruction, the epic preserves invaluable information about ancient Tamil Buddhism, philosophical debates, maritime trade, urban life, and South India's religious diversity, making it simultaneously devotional literature, philosophical treatise, and cultural encyclopedia."
