# Folklore of the Santal Parganas

## Overview

"Folklore of the Santal Parganas" is a 483-page collection of oral traditions from the Santal people (a Munda-speaking tribe of eastern India), translated by Cecil Henry Bompas and published in 1909. The stories were collected by Rev. P. O. Bodding, a Norwegian missionary who spent decades living among the Santals and gained deep access to their cultural knowledge. This work represents one of the most comprehensive early collections of tribal folklore from the Indian subcontinent.

## Historical Context

The Santals are an Austroasiatic-speaking tribal group inhabiting the Chota Nagpur plateau region (present-day Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha, and Bihar). By the early 20th century, Santal society was undergoing transformation through colonial administration, labor migration, and missionary activity. Bodding's long-term residence (he mastered the Santhali language and compiled a massive Santhali-English dictionary) gave him extraordinary access to traditional knowledge that outsiders rarely obtained. The collection thus preserves narratives from a period when oral traditions remained vibrant but were beginning to face challenges from modernization.

## Content

**Structure**: Organized into six thematic sections:

**Part I - General Stories**:
- Origin myths including the famous "husk myth" explaining Santal origins
- Creation narratives and cosmological stories
- Tales explaining natural phenomena
- Historical legends

**Part II - Animal Tales**:
- Fables featuring animals with human characteristics
- Trickster narratives
- Stories explaining animal behaviors and characteristics
- Moral tales using animal protagonists

**Part III - Anecdotes of Santal Life**:
- Stories reflecting everyday Santal experiences
- Social commentary through narrative
- Humorous tales
- Stories about social norms and transgressions

**Part IV - Bonga Stories**:
- Narratives about bongas (supernatural beings/spirits)
- Human-spirit interactions
- Propitiation of supernatural forces
- Sacred groves and spirit dwellings

**Part V - Legends and Traditions**:
- Clan origins and migrations
- Heroic figures in Santal history
- Traditional customs and their origins
- Inter-community relations

**Part VI - Witchcraft Narratives** (Extensive Section):
- Initiation rituals into witchcraft
- Powers and practices of witches (dayans)
- Protective measures against witchcraft
- Witch identification and punishment
- Beliefs about malevolent supernatural agency

## Significance

**Cultural Preservation**: Preserves a vast body of oral literature that might otherwise have been lost as Santal society transformed. The stories encode traditional knowledge, values, and worldviews.

**Insight into Santal Cosmology**: The extensive witchcraft narratives reveal complex belief systems about causation, misfortune, social conflict, and supernatural agency. Provides window into how Santals understood and explained events in their world.

**Methodological Value**: Represents early systematic collection of tribal folklore in India, setting precedents for later anthropological folklore studies. Bodding's long-term residence and linguistic competence enabled collection of materials that brief visitors couldn't access.

**Literary Value**: The narratives themselves are compelling literature, demonstrating sophisticated oral storytelling traditions with recurring motifs, memorable characters, and complex plots.

**Social History**: Stories reflect social structures, gender relations, economic practices, and community dynamics of early 20th-century Santal society. Valuable historical evidence beyond what formal ethnographies typically capture.

**Comparative Folklore**: Enables comparison with folklore from other Indian tribes and from global folklore traditions, revealing both universal narrative patterns and culture-specific elements.

**Contemporary Relevance**: Remains important for Santal communities themselves as repository of traditional knowledge and for scholars studying indigenous oral literatures, tribal religions, and cultural change.

**Insider-Outsider Perspective**: While collected by a missionary outsider (with attendant biases), Bodding's long residence and linguistic expertise produced unusually authentic documentation compared to typical colonial-era collections.
