# État civil, politique et commerçant du Bengale (Volume 1)

## Overview
Originally published in English as *Considerations on India Affairs* (1772), William Bolts’s insider account challenged the East India Company’s seizure of Bengal and the famine-inducing private trade of its servants. This authorised 1778 French edition expanded his argument for European audiences, documenting the Company’s wars, monopolies, and administrative failures after the Battle of Plassey.

## Highlights
Bolts details how the Company appropriated zamindari rights, forced textile producers into coercive contracts, and remitted fortunes to London while Bengal’s treasury collapsed. He cites Persian revenue records, parliamentary inquiries, and testimony from former Company officials to argue for tighter state oversight and restitution to Indian revenues.

## Access Notes
The University of California Libraries facsimile on the Internet Archive includes the full French preface, extensive footnotes, and appendices comparing English and French mercantile policy—resources helpful for studying transnational critiques of Company governance.
