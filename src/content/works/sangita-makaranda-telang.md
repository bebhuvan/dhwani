# Saṅgīta-makaranda (Essence of Music)

## Overview

The Saṅgīta-makaranda is a Sanskrit musicological treatise attributed to the semi-mythical sage Narada, tentatively dated to the 7th-9th century CE, though some scholars place it as late as the 11th century. The work represents a critical transitional document between ancient Sanskrit music theory codified in Bharata's Natyashastra (prior to 2nd century BCE) and the comprehensive medieval synthesis achieved in Sharangdeva's Sangita-Ratnakara (13th century CE). The 1920 edition by Mangesh Ramakrishna Telang, published as Volume XVI in the Gaekwad's Oriental Series by the Central Library of Baroda, made this text accessible to modern scholarship for the first time in printed form. Telang's edition provided critical apparatus and commentary on a manuscript tradition that had been transmitted through practitioner lineages, preserving theoretical frameworks that continue to inform both Hindustani and Carnatic performance practice.

The treatise comprises two parts—one devoted to music (sangita), the other to dance (nartana)—each subdivided into four sections totaling seven primary topics: Naada (sound), Sruti (microtonal intervals), Svara (notes), Raga (melodic frameworks), Veena (string instruments), Taala (rhythmic cycles), and Nartana (dance). The music section addresses foundational acoustical and modal theory before advancing to raga taxonomy, instrumental organology describing nineteen distinct types of veena, and an exhaustive catalogue of 101 talas. This comprehensive coverage establishes the Sangita-makaranda as one of the earliest Sanskrit texts to systematically integrate acoustic theory, scalar organization, melodic classification, instrumental technology, and rhythmic structure within a unified theoretical framework.

The text's complicated Sanskrit style and dense technical terminology have made it challenging reading even for specialists, yet this very difficulty reflects its role as a practitioner's manual rather than a popularizing introduction. Its preservation of archaic terminology and classification systems provides invaluable evidence for reconstructing the evolution of Indian music theory across the first millennium CE.

## About the Original Author and Translator

The attribution of Sangita-makaranda to Narada remains a subject of scholarly debate. In Hindu tradition, Narada is a celestial sage and divine musician appearing throughout the Puranas and epics, making definitive historical identification problematic. The text's attribution to this semi-mythical figure suggests either an attempt to establish divine sanction for the theoretical system presented, a conventional ascription to authorize the text within the Sanskrit scholastic tradition, or possibly the work of a historical author adopting the name Narada as a pseudonym. The chronological uncertainty—ranging from the 7th to potentially the 11th century—reflects both the absence of definitive manuscript evidence and the text's eclectic incorporation of material from multiple historical strata. Some passages closely follow Sharangdeva's later formulations, leading to questions about textual interpolation or redaction. The work describes itself as collecting "definitions, descriptions and comments on all the essential music by other ancient reputed authors from Bharata Muni to Sharangdeva," suggesting it may be a compilation or digest of earlier sources rather than an entirely original composition.

Mangesh Ramakrishna Telang (born 1859) was a distinguished Sanskrit scholar and editor whose contributions to the preservation of classical Sanskrit literature extended across multiple disciplines. His editorial work included important texts in poetics (Kavyalankara Sangraha of Udaha Bhatta, 1915), drama (Malatimadhava of Bhavabhuti, 1936), and logic (Nyaya Lilavati). His 1920 edition of the Sangita-makaranda represented a pioneering effort in musicological scholarship, making one of the very few Sanskrit music treatises available in modern critical edition at that time. Working within the institutional framework of the Gaekwad's Oriental Series—a major scholarly publishing initiative of the Baroda State—Telang established Sanskrit text, provided apparatus for variant readings, and offered interpretive commentary that enabled subsequent musicological research. His work appeared at a crucial moment when Western-trained Indian musicologists were beginning systematic documentation of classical music theory, and his edition provided essential primary source material for this emerging field.

## The Work

The structural organization of Sangita-makaranda reflects a systematic progression from acoustic fundamentals to performance practice. The first section addresses the metaphysical origins of Naada (primordial sound) and the derivation of the seven svaras (notes), associating each svara with specific deities, poetic meters (chhandas), and aesthetic emotions (rasa). This section discusses the three gramas (modal scale systems)—Shadja-grama, Madhyama-grama, and Gandharva-grama—assigning each to a deity (Brahma, Vishnu, Maheswara) and a season (winter, summer, rainy season respectively). The text names the seven murchanas (modal rotations) of Gandharva-grama as Nandi, Visala, Sumukhi, Chitra, Chitravati, Shukha, and Aalapa, preserving nomenclature largely lost in later treatises. The treatise distinguishes between prakrti (ascending natural notes) and vikrti (descending scales or altered notes), establishing fundamental concepts of melodic directionality that remain central to raga aesthetics.

The second and third sections present the text's most significant contribution: a comprehensive enumeration of 101 talas with their structural characteristics, followed by theoretical exposition on tala derivation, essential properties (tala-daśaprāṇas as composite units), and the distinction between marga (classical/orthodox) and desi (regional/popular) rhythmic practices. This systematic cataloguing of rhythmic cycles represents one of the earliest extensive treatments of tala theory in Sanskrit musicology, providing evidence for percussion traditions that preceded the consolidation of the standard tala systems in later centuries.

The raga section introduces the foundational gender-based classification system that profoundly influenced subsequent Indian music theory. Narada categorizes ragas as masculine (raga), feminine (ragini), and neuter (napumsaka), organizing them into six raga families (raga-parivara) each headed by a male raga with associated female raginis. This system establishes mythological origins linking the raga families to the union of Shiva and Shakti, embedding musical taxonomy within broader Hindu cosmological frameworks. The masculine ragas are associated with the emotions (rasa) of raudra (fury), veera (heroism), and bhayanaka (terror); feminine raginis with shringara (erotic love), hasya (humor), and karuna (pathos); and neuter ragas with vibhatsa (disgust), adbhuta (wonder), and shanta (tranquility). This nine-fold emotional mapping directly correlates raga gender with the rasa theory derived from Bharata's dramaturgy, creating an integrated aesthetic system.

The text further documents three evolutionary stages in raga nomenclature: early ragas named after prominent svaras (scale degrees), intermediate ragas named after tribes or clans from specific regions, and later ragas named after janapada (geographical territories). This tripartite historical schema provides critical evidence for the geographical diffusion and social embedding of raga practice across different communities and regions of medieval India. The treatise's coverage of various musical terms including vadi (principal note), samvadi (consonant note), sruti (microtonal pitch), and alamkara (ornamentation) established terminological standards that persisted in subsequent musicological literature.

The fourth section, devoted to instrumental practice, describes nineteen types of veena with distinct structural characteristics, tunings, and performance contexts, offering invaluable organological documentation of medieval Indian string instruments. A concluding subsection of thirty-three verses addresses dance (natibhavanirupanam), cataloguing five double hand-gestures (hasta), five single hand-gestures, eight bhramaris (spinning movements), nine head movements (shiro-bheda), and four foot movements (pada-bheda), demonstrating the integrated nature of medieval performance arts where music and dance shared common theoretical foundations.

## Historical Significance

The Sangita-makaranda occupies a pivotal position in the history of Indian music theory as a bridge document between ancient and medieval theoretical traditions. Its compilation of earlier sources and terminology preserves concepts and classifications that were already archaic when the text was composed, providing crucial evidence for reconstructing the evolution of Indian musical thought across the first millennium CE. The text's influence appears in later treatises, particularly Sharangdeva's Sangita-Ratnakara, which adopted the gender-based raga classification and raga-parivara family system, though expanding and systematizing these categories considerably. The Sangita-makaranda's documentation of 101 talas represents an earlier, more elaborate rhythmic taxonomy than appears in subsequent texts, suggesting either a contraction of tala practice in later periods or a shift from theoretical enumeration to practical standardization.

The treatise's association of ragas with the nine canonical rasas (emotions) established a fundamental aesthetic principle that continues to govern raga performance: the notion that specific melodic configurations evoke particular emotional states in performers and listeners. This psycho-acoustic theory, rooted in Bharata's dramaturgy but here systematically applied to instrumental and vocal music, became axiomatic in later Indian music aesthetics. The tripartite historical schema for raga nomenclature evolution provides one of the few attempts in Sanskrit musicological literature to theorize historical change in musical practice, moving beyond synchronic description to diachronic analysis.

Telang's 1920 edition appeared at a crucial historical moment when British colonial scholarship, Indian nationalist cultural recovery, and emerging ethnomusicology were converging to create modern Indian musicology. The availability of the Sangita-makaranda in printed critical edition enabled comparative analysis with other treatises, supported arguments about the antiquity and systematic sophistication of Indian music theory, and provided source material for the theoretical justification of contemporary performance practice. The text's complicated Sanskrit and technical density also illustrated the challenges of accessing traditional knowledge systems without both Sanskrit philological training and practical musical expertise, highlighting the disciplinary boundaries that continue to separate text-based musicology from performance-based pedagogy.

The gender-based raga classification system documented in Sangita-makaranda, while eventually superseded by the thāṭ system in Hindustani music and the melakarta system in Carnatic music, continued to influence iconographic representations of ragas in Mughal and Rajput miniature painting traditions, where ragas were personified as divine or royal figures in gendered narratives. This transmission of musical theory into visual arts demonstrates the broader cultural resonance of the concepts systematized in Sanskrit musicological treatises.
