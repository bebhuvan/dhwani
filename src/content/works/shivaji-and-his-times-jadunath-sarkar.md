Sir Jadunath Sarkar's "Shivaji and His Times" (1919) established modern critical historiography of the Maratha founder through systematic exploitation of multilingual archival sources and application of Rankean methodology to seventeenth-century Indian history. Published initially in 1919 with a substantially revised and enlarged second edition in June 1920, the work represented the first rigorously documented biographical treatment of Shivaji Bhonsle grounded in exhaustive study of Persian, Marathi, Hindi, English, Dutch, and Portuguese records. Sarkar himself acknowledged that "Aurangzib is my life's work; Shivaji is only an incidental off-shoot of it" in correspondence dated November 1945, positioning the biography within his broader project of reconstructing Mughal decline and Maratha ascendancy through primary documentation.

The work's methodological innovation lay in Sarkar's rigid preference for contemporary records over later compilations and his comparative assessment of evidential value across Persian court chronicles, Marathi bakhars, and European factory correspondence. He utilized absolutely contemporary official histories including the court bulletins of Aurangzeb and Shah Jahan, Muhammad and Ali Adil Shah's chronicles, the entire letter-books of Raja Jai Singh of Amber documenting the 1665-1666 Purandar campaign, Persian news-letters (akbarat-i-darbar-i-mulk), and the complete texts of Bhimsen's Nuskha-i-Dilkusha and Ishwardas Nagar's Futuhat-i-Alamgiri—both Hindu historians writing in Persian for Mughal patrons—all sources unknown to Captain James Grant Duff's pioneering 1826 "History of the Mahrattas." Sarkar's systematic search of English East India Company factory records and Dutch East India Company archives yielded crucial chronological precision and corroborative evidence for dating military campaigns, diplomatic negotiations, and administrative innovations during Shivaji's expansion from jagirdar status under Bijapur to independent Chhatrapati by 1674.

Among Marathi sources, Sarkar critically distinguished between the relatively reliable Sabhasad Bakhar, composed by Krishnaji Anant Sabhasad at Jinji in 1697 while serving Shivaji's son Rajaram, and the 91-Kalami Bakhar attributed to Dattaji Trimal Wakenavis of the Ashta Pradhan council, which Sarkar translated for Modern Review in 1907. He rejected Grant Duff's heavy reliance on the tendentious Chitnis Bakhar written in 1810—183 years after Shivaji's birth—preferring Sabhasad's firsthand courtier observations and incorporating materials from forty years of Marathi publications by scholars at Pune and Satara. The second edition added critical appendices examining evidentiary problems in the Javli conquest and the Pratapgarh encounter with Afzal Khan in November 1659, where Sarkar's analysis of Persian, Marathi, and English accounts demonstrated that Afzal Khan had planned to assassinate Shivaji during their meeting, refuting accusations of treacherous murder and alleviating public indignation against Grant Duff's earlier portrayal. This forensic reconstruction of the Afzal Khan episode through cross-verification of Adilshahi chronicles, Mughal court reports, and Maratha bakhars exemplified Sarkar's source-critical methodology.

Sarkar prepared for his historian's vocation by acquiring sound knowledge of Persian and Marathi after leaving Calcutta University, influenced by the critical historiography of Leopold von Ranke, Barthold Georg Niebuhr, and Theodor Mommsen. His commitment to "scientific" history grounded in documentary evidence as practiced by nineteenth-century German scholarship shaped his approach to objectivity and systematic archival research. The work provided exact geographical locations for military operations using British Survey of India maps, corrected Grant Duff's numerous chronological inaccuracies through triangulation of dated Persian newsletters and English correspondence, and established detailed year-by-year reconstruction of Shivaji's campaigns against Bijapur, skirmishes with Mughal forces, naval operations along the Konkan coast, and administrative innovations including revenue assessment systems and military organization. Sarkar's painstaking collation of Marathi revenue documents, Persian diplomatic letters, and European mercantile reports produced the first comprehensive account of Shivaji's statecraft grounded in contemporary bureaucratic records rather than hagiographic tradition.

The second edition incorporated newly discovered materials including Shivaji's letter protesting Aurangzeb's reimposition of the jizya poll-tax on Hindus, extensive notes on Shivaji's physical appearance and extant portraits, and documentation of the first military engagement between English East India Company forces and Maratha troops. Sarkar's minute examination of English and Dutch factory records yielded intelligence on commercial disruptions caused by Maratha expansion, European perceptions of Shivaji's territorial ambitions, and diplomatic communications between Mughal officials and European trading establishments regarding Shivaji's depredations on Surat in 1664 and 1670. His integration of Portuguese archival materials illuminated Shivaji's confrontations with Portuguese Goa and acquisition of strategic coastal fortresses. The work's exhaustive documentation extended to Persian manuscript collections, Rajasthani dispatches from Amber documenting Jai Singh's perspective on Mughal-Maratha negotiations, and French commercial records, establishing a multiarchival foundation unprecedented in Maratha historiography.

Sarkar's critical apparatus distinguished evidential reliability among source categories: contemporary official chronicles possessed highest authority, followed by private memoirs of participants like Bhimsen and Sabhasad, then diplomatic correspondence and commercial records, with later bakhars and bardic compositions ranked lowest. He demonstrated sophisticated analysis of authorial bias, noting Mughal court historians' tendency to minimize Shivaji's military successes, Maratha chroniclers' exaggeration of enemy force strengths—as with inflated figures for Afzal Khan's army contradicted by English letters and the Tarikh-i-Ali—and European factors' commercial interests shaping their political reporting. This hierarchical source evaluation and bias assessment established protocols for Maratha historical scholarship, though Sarkar's reliance on Persian sources produced through British colonial patronage and his preference for "objective facts" over "false patriotism" generated immediate criticism from N.S. Takakhav and Pune-based historians who contested his treatment of Shivaji as insufficiently valorizing Maratha nationalist aspirations.

The work's reception reflected tensions between critical historiography and political investment in Shivaji's legacy during late colonial nationalism. Upper-caste Maratha historians objected to Sarkar's clinical analysis and perceived Mughal sympathies, while anti-Brahmin activists in Maharashtra appropriated Shivaji as lower-caste icon against Brahmanical dominance, complicating reception of Sarkar's scholarly apparatus. A review by 'Junata Purusha' in Mahratta on August 17, 1919 captured contemporary responses to Sarkar's methodology. Despite political controversies, the work established documentary standards for Maratha historiography, influenced subsequent regional histories, and remained authoritative until Marxist and postcolonial historiographical shifts in the 1970s redirected scholarly attention from biographical narrative and character analysis toward institutional structures, socioeconomic formations, and subaltern perspectives. Sarkar's compilation continued through his editorship with G.S. Sardesai of the fourteen-volume "English Records of Maratha History: Poona Residency Correspondence" (1936-1958) and his two-volume "Persian Records of Maratha History" (1953-1954), extending the multiarchival approach pioneered in "Shivaji and His Times" across eighteenth-century Maratha expansion.

The biographical reconstruction integrated military history with administrative development, tracing Shivaji's evolution from Bijapur jagirdar managing Pune and surrounding territories to independent sovereign crowned at Raigad in June 1674 through systematic territorial acquisition, fort construction, revenue innovation, and naval development. Sarkar documented Shivaji's guerrilla tactics in Sahyadri mountain warfare, administrative reliance on Brahmin bureaucrats in the Ashta Pradhan council balanced against Maratha military commanders, revenue settlements synthesizing Malik Ambar's earlier Deccan systems with adaptations for Maratha conditions, and conscious adoption of Sanskrit political vocabulary rejecting Persian administrative terminology. The work established chronological frameworks for major episodes: escape from Agra detention in August 1666 following forced attendance at Aurangzeb's Daulatabad durbar, southern campaigns into Karnataka territories yielding Jinji and other strategic fortresses, and diplomatic maneuvering between Bijapur, the Mughal empire, and regional powers. Sarkar's integration of numismatic evidence, epigraphic materials, and architectural documentation of fort construction supplemented textual sources, establishing multidisciplinary methodology.

Later historiographical developments questioned Sarkar's emphasis on Shivaji's individual agency rather than broader Deccan political economy, challenged his treatment of Marathi sources as less reliable than Persian chronicles despite their temporal proximity to events, and critiqued his adoption of colonial-era categorizations distinguishing "scientific" European scholarship from "mythologized" Indian traditions. His framing of Shivaji within Mughal decline narrative positioned Maratha state-building as reactive to imperial collapse rather than autonomous political formation, reflecting his primary investment in Aurangzeb's reign. Nevertheless, the work's documentary apparatus, source-critical methodology, chronological precision, and multilingual archival foundation established baseline standards for subsequent Maratha scholarship. Sarkar's demonstration that rigorous historical reconstruction of premodern India required mastery of Persian, Marathi, and European archival repositories shaped professional historical training, while his biographical approach influenced regional historiography across twentieth-century India despite later scholars' methodological departures toward structural analysis and postcolonial critique of objectivist epistemologies.
