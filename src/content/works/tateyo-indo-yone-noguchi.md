# Tateyō Indo (立てよ印度)

## Context

Japan’s 1942 victories in Southeast Asia encouraged pan-Asian ideologues to court anti-colonial movements. Poet and essayist Yone Noguchi—long known for bridging Japanese and Indian literati—revisited his early twentieth-century travels through Calcutta to argue that India’s cultural strength should align with Japan’s wartime campaign.

## Key themes

- Recollections of Noguchi’s friendships with Rabindranath Tagore and Sister Nivedita frame a narrative of spiritual kinship between Japan and India.
- The text denounces British imperialism and praises Subhas Chandra Bose’s alliance with Japan, calling on Indian youth to join a broader Asian uprising.
- Noguchi interprets Japan’s Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere as a vehicle for reviving Asian civilisation, casting Japanese leadership as benevolent and necessary.

## Research notes

Written in pre-war Japanese orthography, the pamphlet mixes literary prose with slogans. It offers rare insight into civilian intellectual propaganda targeting India and can be read alongside Radio Tokyo broadcasts and Indian National Army publications.
