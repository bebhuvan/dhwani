## Historical Context

Yone Noguchi's "Tateyō Indo" (Stand Up, India) emerges as a critical text within the complex transnational discourse of anti-colonial resistance during World War II, articulating a radical pan-Asian vision of solidarity against Western imperial domination. Written in 1942 at the height of Japanese imperial expansion and India's independence movement, the manifesto represents a significant intellectual intervention that challenged prevailing colonial narratives by positioning Japan as a potential liberator of Asian peoples. Noguchi, a Japanese poet and cultural mediator who had extensively studied and traveled in India, drew upon his deep understanding of Indian cultural and political contexts to craft a provocative call for Asian unity. The text interweaves personal observations from Calcutta with a strategic rhetorical appeal to Indian nationalism, reflecting the intricate geopolitical negotiations of the era. Drawing from his transnational experiences and literary networks, Noguchi positioned the work within a broader intellectual movement that sought to reimagine Asian identity beyond colonial boundaries. The manifesto critically examines the potential for inter-Asian collaboration, leveraging Japan's imperial rhetoric of anti-Western resistance while simultaneously critiquing existing power structures. Its significance extends beyond immediate wartime propaganda, offering a nuanced exploration of cultural resistance, transnational solidarity, and the complex negotiations of identity during a transformative period of global conflict. Noguchi's text represents an important artifact in understanding the intellectual genealogies of anti-colonial thought, demonstrating how literary and cultural discourses intersected with emerging political movements in mid-20th century Asia.

# Tateyō Indo (立てよ印度)

## Context

Japan’s 1942 victories in Southeast Asia encouraged pan-Asian ideologues to court anti-colonial movements. Poet and essayist Yone Noguchi—long known for bridging Japanese and Indian literati—revisited his early twentieth-century travels through Calcutta to argue that India’s cultural strength should align with Japan’s wartime campaign.

## Key themes

- Recollections of Noguchi’s friendships with Rabindranath Tagore and Sister Nivedita frame a narrative of spiritual kinship between Japan and India.
- The text denounces British imperialism and praises Subhas Chandra Bose’s alliance with Japan, calling on Indian youth to join a broader Asian uprising.
- Noguchi interprets Japan’s Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere as a vehicle for reviving Asian civilisation, casting Japanese leadership as benevolent and necessary.

## Research notes

Written in pre-war Japanese orthography, the pamphlet mixes literary prose with slogans. It offers rare insight into civilian intellectual propaganda targeting India and can be read alongside Radio Tokyo broadcasts and Indian National Army publications.
