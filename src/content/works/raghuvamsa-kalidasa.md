description: "Kalidasa's Raghuvamsa chronicles the illustrious Raghu dynasty across nineteen cantos, tracing the lineage from King Dilipa through Rama and his descendants. Composed in twenty-one distinct Sanskrit meters, this mahakavya exemplifies classical kavya at its finest, blending royal genealogy with profound meditations on dharma, statecraft, romantic love, and cosmic order. The narrative moves from Dilipa's childlessness and devotion to the celestial cow Nandini, through Raghu's world conquests, Aja's tragic romance with Indumati, Dasharatha's reign, the complete Ramayana arc, and concludes with later descendants including the dissolute Agnivarna, demonstrating the cyclical rise and fall of dynasties."
