# Tulu-English and English-Tulu Dictionary

## Overview
This bilingual lexicon reflects late nineteenth-century linguistic fieldwork in the Tulu-speaking districts of South Canara. Maenner documents vernacular usage with phonetic guides, idioms, and cross-references to related Dravidian forms, making the volume one of the earliest extensive dictionaries devoted to Tulu.

## Highlights
Entries include agricultural, liturgical, and maritime terminology, illustrating the cultural and economic life of Tuluva communities under colonial administration. The reverse section enables English speakers to locate appropriate Tulu equivalents, supporting translation work in schools, churches, and courts.

## Access Notes
The University of Toronto digitisation delivers clean OCR, download options in PDF and EPUB formats, and a page-turner interface that retains the mission press typography and diacritical marks used to represent retroflex and aspirated sounds.
