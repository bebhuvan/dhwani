# The Life of Shivaji Maharaj

## Overview

This comprehensive biography of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj (1630-1680), co-authored by Krishnaji Arjun Keluskar and N. S. Takakhav, provides a detailed account of the life and achievements of the founder of the Maratha Empire. The work chronicles Shivaji's rise from a small jagir to establishing an independent kingdom that challenged the mighty Mughal Empire and laid the foundation for Maratha supremacy in India.

## About the Authors

**Krishnaji Arjun Keluskar** (1855-1905) was a prominent Marathi writer, historian, and social reformer who played a significant role in the social and educational reform movements in Maharashtra. He was instrumental in promoting education among the lower castes and was notably a mentor to Dr. B.R. Ambedkar.

**N. S. Takakhav** was a collaborator who worked with Keluskar to bring this important historical biography to a wider audience, particularly through the English translation that made the work accessible beyond Marathi-speaking regions.

## Historical Context

Published in 1921 (English edition), this biography emerged during India's freedom struggle when historical figures like Shivaji were being reinterpreted as symbols of resistance against foreign rule. The work served to inspire Indians by highlighting Shivaji's successful resistance against the Mughal Empire and his establishment of indigenous rule (Swarajya).

## Literary and Historical Significance

This collaborative biography is significant for several reasons:
- It presents Shivaji's life from a Marathi perspective, drawing on local sources and traditions
- The work contributed to the nationalist movement by highlighting indigenous resistance to foreign rule
- It helped establish Shivaji as a pan-Indian hero and symbol of self-governance
- The collaboration between authors ensured a comprehensive and well-researched account
- Multiple editions available through the Internet Archive ensure wide accessibility
