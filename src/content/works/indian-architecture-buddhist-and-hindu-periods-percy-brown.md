description: 'Percy Brown''s seminal work "Indian Architecture: Buddhist and Hindu
  Periods" represents a critical scholarly intervention in understanding India''s
  architectural heritage during the transitional post-colonial period of the late
  1950s. Published at a moment of intense academic reclamation of indigenous cultural
  narratives, the text systematically documents architectural evolution from the Mauryan
  period (c. 322-185 BCE) through medieval temple constructions, offering a comprehensive
  archaeological analysis of Buddhist and Hindu architectural traditions. Brown, a
  British architectural historian who dedicated significant professional research
  to the Indian subcontinent, synthesizes decades of archaeological research, colonial-era
  documentation, and measured site studies to present a rigorous architectural typology.
  The work meticulously catalogs structural forms including stupas, chaitya-grihas,
  viharas, and temple architectures representing Nagara, Dravida, and Vesara stylistic
  traditions, substantiated by over 500 precise architectural drawings, photographs,
  and site plans. Beyond its documentary value, the text critically examines architectural
  morphology as a lens for understanding cultural, religious, and technological transformations
  across different historical epochs. By systematically analyzing spatial configurations,
  decorative elements, and structural innovations, Brown illuminates the intricate
  relationships between architectural practice and broader socio-religious contexts
  in pre-modern Indian civilizations. The work remains a foundational reference for
  scholars of Indian architectural history, archaeology, and cultural studies, providing
  an empirically grounded narrative of architectural development that transcends colonial
  epistemological frameworks and centers indigenous architectural knowledge and practices.

# Indian Architecture: Buddhist and Hindu Periods

## Overview

Published by D.B. Taraporevala (Bombay, 1959), this extensively illustrated volume provides systematic classification of South Asian sacred architecture from the Mauryan period through medieval temple complexes. Brown organizes monuments by structural typology and regional style, supported by measured plans, elevations, and photographic documentation from Archaeological Survey of India reports.

## About the Author

Percy Brown (1872–1955) served 28 years in the Indian Education Service, holding positions including Principal of Mayo School of Arts in Lahore (1899–1909), Principal of Government School of Art in Kolkata (1909–1927), and Secretary-Curator of Victoria Memorial Hall (1927–1947). Educated at the Royal College of Art, he became one of the first scholars to concentrate exclusively on Indian and Buddhist architecture. After retirement, he settled in Srinagar until his death in 1955.

## The Work

The volume charts two architectural lineages:

**Buddhist Architecture:** Analyzes stupa tradition (Sanchi, Bharhut, Amaravati) and rock-cut monuments (chaitya-grihas and viharas at Karle, Ajanta, Ellora), correlating architectural form with chronology and patronage patterns.

**Hindu Temples:** Classifies structural temples by plan and superstructure into three orders:
- **Nagara** (North Indian): Characterized by curvilinear shikhara towers
- **Dravida** (South Indian): Pyramidal vimana with horizontal tiers
- **Vesara** (Hybrid forms): Mixing northern and southern elements

Each section includes measured drawings at consistent scale, site plans showing temple complexes, and detailed analysis of constructional techniques, ornamentation patterns, and regional variations.

## Historical Context

Brown's work synthesized early Archaeological Survey reports (Cunningham, Burgess, Fergusson) with his own field observations across India. Published originally in 1942 and reissued in 1959, it established a classification system and terminological framework that shaped mid-twentieth-century pedagogy in Indian architectural history. While later scholarship has refined chronologies and challenged some stylistic categories, Brown's illustrated corpus remains a practical reference for monument identification and architectural vocabulary.

## Significance

The volume's systematic organization and extensive visual documentation make it valuable for:
- Orientation to major monument types and architectural terminology
- Correlation between plan types, elevations, and regional schools
- Cross-reference to ASI site reports through consistent monument nomenclature
- Teaching resource for understanding traditional architectural classifications

Over 500 drawings, photographs, and maps provide visual evidence supporting Brown's typological arguments and enable independent assessment of his classifications.
