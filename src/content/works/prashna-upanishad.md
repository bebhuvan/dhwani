description: "The Prashna Upanishad presents Vedantic philosophy through a unique question-answer format where six earnest seekers approach sage Pippalada with fundamental inquiries about existence, consciousness, life-force, sleep, Om meditation, and the sixteen-fold person, receiving systematic teachings that establish prana (vital breath) as cosmic principle connecting individual with universal reality. Composed around 5th-4th century BCE, this text of six questions (prashna means question) belongs to the Atharvaveda and demonstrates pedagogical sophistication: requiring students practice austerity for one year before questioning ensures spiritual preparation; systematic progression from cosmological origins through physiological processes to contemplative realization guides understanding from gross to subtle; and the teacher's comprehensive responses synthesize ritual knowledge, physiological observation, psychological insight, and metaphysical speculation. The text's detailed prana analysis—describing vital breath's divisions, functions, and cosmic significance—profoundly influenced yoga traditions, Ayurvedic medicine, and Vedantic anthropology, while its Om-meditation teaching contributed to mantra yoga and sound-based spiritual practices across Indian traditions."
