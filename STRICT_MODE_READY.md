## 🎯 NEXT STEP: LAUNCH PHASE 1

### Phase 1 Will Process All 79 Works Through 4 Parallel Agents:

**Agent 1A:** Archive.org validator (works 1-20)
**Agent 1B:** Multi-API reference hunter (works 21-40)
**Agent 1C:** PD verification with Wikipedia (works 41-60)
**Agent 1D:** Genre & classification expert (works 61-79)

### Each Agent Will:
- Process ~20 works independently
- Apply strict validation rules
- Generate detailed reports
- Flag issues for human review
- Output: enhanced metadata, references, classifications

### After Phase 1:
- All metadata validated against Archive.org
- All works have 3+ quality references
- All PD status verified (CERTAIN/LIKELY only proceed)
- All genres corrected (no more "General", "City")
- All tags enhanced (8-15 specific tags)

### Duration: ~2-3 hours
