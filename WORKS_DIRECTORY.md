### 271. Prashna Upanishad

**Author(s):** Various Sages
**Year:** -500  **Language(s):** Sanskrit, English
**Genre(s):** Philosophy, Religious Texts, Ancient Wisdom
**Link:** [/works/prashna-upanishad](/works/prashna-upanishad)

The Prashna Upanishad presents Vedantic philosophy through a unique question-answer format where six earnest seekers approach sage Pippalada with fundamental inquiries about existence, consciousness, life-force, sleep, Om meditation, and the sixteen-fold person, receiving systematic teachings that establish prana (vital breath) as cosmic principle connecting individual with universal reality.  Composed around 5th-4th century BCE, this text of six questions (prashna means question) belongs to the Atharvaveda and demonstrates pedagogical sophistication: requiring students practice austerity for one year before questioning ensures spiritual preparation; systematic progression from cosmological origins through physiological processes to contemplative realization guides understanding from gross to subtle; and the teacher's comprehensive responses synthesize ritual knowledge, physiological observation, psychological insight, and metaphysical speculation.
