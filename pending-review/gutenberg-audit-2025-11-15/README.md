5. **Social reform** - Annie Besant's Indian-focused social writings

## Recommendations

### Phase 1: Add High Priority Works (10 works)
Start with the Tier 1 essential works - these fill critical gaps and are all English-language texts directly relevant to Indian culture, philosophy, and literature.

### Phase 2: Add Medium Priority Works (15-25 works)
Add selected Tier 2 works to provide comprehensive coverage, particularly:
- F. Max Müller's essay collections on Indian topics
- Yoga philosophy texts
- Additional Buddhist literature
- Indian historical/cultural works

### Phase 3: Optional Additions
- Selected works based on specific interests
- Foreign language translations only if expanding multilingual coverage

## NOT Recommended for Addition

- Foreign language translations of works already available in English
- Purely theosophical/occult works without Indian cultural content
- Tangentially related works (e.g., bird watching guides)

## Quality Standards

All works prepared for review maintain Dhwani's quality standards:
- Scholarly descriptions (100-200 words)
- Multiple backup sources (Archive.org, Gutenberg, Wikisource when available)
- Comprehensive references (Wikipedia, Open Library, academic sources)
- Proper YAML frontmatter with all required fields
- Historical and cultural context

## Next Steps

1. **Review** the high-priority works in the `high-priority/` folder
2. **Verify** metadata and descriptions are accurate
3. **Approve** works for addition to the main repository
4. **Move approved works** to `/home/user/dhwani/src/content/works/`
5. **Test** build and validate schema
6. **Commit** changes to the feature branch
