## ❓ Questions?

### "Should I add all foreign language Tagore translations?"
**No.** Your repository is English-focused. You already have Tagore's essential English works. The 13 foreign language translations (German, Finnish, French, Dutch) are low priority unless you're expanding to multilingual coverage.

### "What about Annie Besant's theosophical works?"
**Mixed.** Her Indian-focused works (autobiography, social reform) are HIGH priority. Her purely theosophical/occult works (thought-forms, occult chemistry) are LOW priority. See **PRIORITIES.md** for specific recommendations.

### "Are there Indian works on Gutenberg that this audit missed?"
**Unlikely but possible.** I searched:
- 15+ Indian author pages
- 2 subject bookshelves (India, Hinduism)
- Multiple subject searches (Buddhism, Sanskrit, Jainism, etc.)
- Cross-referenced against your existing 294 works

If you know of specific works, let me know and I can investigate.

### "What about Archive.org or other sources?"
**Great question!** This audit focused only on Project Gutenberg. There are likely many more Indian works on:
- Internet Archive
- Wikisource
- Digital Library of India
- Sanchaya

Would you like me to audit those sources next?
