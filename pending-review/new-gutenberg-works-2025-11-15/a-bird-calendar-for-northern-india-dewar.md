description: |
  Douglas Dewar's *A Bird Calendar for Northern India*, published in 1916, offers a month-by-month guide to the ornithological observations available in northern India's plains and foothills, documenting seasonal patterns of resident and migratory bird species. Dewar, a British civil servant who spent decades in India developing expertise in South Asian ornithology, structures his work as a practical naturalist's companion organized by calendar months, describing which species can be observed during each period, their breeding behaviors, plumage variations, and distinctive calls. The work reflects the colonial-era tradition of amateur natural history in which British administrators contributed significantly to scientific documentation of India's biodiversity while pursuing ornithology as leisure activity. Dewar's accessible prose combines rigorous observational detail with engaging narrative, making technical ornithological information comprehensible to educated lay readers interested in Indian wildlife. The calendar format reveals seasonal rhythms of the subcontinent's avifauna—monsoon breeding patterns, winter migrations from Central Asia, summer visitors, and year-round residents—providing valuable baseline ecological data from the early twentieth century now useful for historical comparison given contemporary climate change and habitat transformation. While written from a colonial perspective that viewed India primarily as field site for European scientific inquiry, Dewar's meticulous field observations contribute to understanding of South Asian ornithological history and represent the period's natural history writing tradition.
