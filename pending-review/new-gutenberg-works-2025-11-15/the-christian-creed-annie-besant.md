  Annie Besant's *The Christian Creed; or, What it is Blasphemy to Deny*, published in 1883, represents her militant atheist period before her conversion to Theosophy, offering a systematic critique of Christian doctrine through legal and philosophical analysis. Written in the context of nineteenth-century British blasphemy laws that criminalized denial of Christian tenets, Besant's pamphlet examines precisely which theological propositions were legally protected and subjects them to rational scrutiny. She challenges the doctrine of the Trinity, the divinity of Christ, the authority of scripture, eternal punishment, and other orthodox beliefs, arguing that these dogmas contradict reason, science, and ethical common sense. The work demonstrates Besant's formidable rhetorical skills and legal acumen—she had studied law to defend herself in the notorious Knowlton trial concerning birth control advocacy—applied to theological controversy. Her critique reflects Victorian freethought movement strategies that used scientific rationalism, textual criticism, and ethical arguments to challenge religious orthodoxy while advocating for freedom of conscience and expression. Notably, this work precedes Besant's 1889 conversion to Theosophy and subsequent embrace of Hindu and Buddhist philosophy, making it valuable for understanding her intellectual trajectory from materialist atheism through socialism to esoteric spirituality. The text illuminates Victorian debates about religious authority, state enforcement of orthodoxy, and the relationship between faith and reason.
