description: |
  Annie Besant's *Is the Bible Indictable?*, published in 1877, presents a bold legal and moral argument that the Christian Bible, if judged by the same standards applied to secular literature, would be subject to prosecution under British obscenity laws. Written immediately following her infamous trial for distributing Charles Knowlton's birth control pamphlet—a case that made her a national figure and subjected her writings to intense scrutiny—Besant turned the tables on her prosecutors by examining biblical content through the lens of Victorian obscenity statutes. She catalogs passages describing sexual violence, incest, divine-sanctioned genocide, and other material that, in secular publications, would violate laws against corrupting public morals. The pamphlet employs devastating irony: if authorities prosecuted advocates of birth control for obscenity, how could they excuse biblical narratives containing far more explicit and morally problematic content? Besant's argument challenged the double standard protecting religious texts from critical examination while subjecting freethought literature to legal persecution. The work exemplifies Victorian freethought tactics of using Christianity's own sacred texts to critique religious authority, demonstrating internal contradictions and moral incoherence in orthodox positions. Beyond legal argumentation, the pamphlet advances Besant's broader case that secular ethics grounded in reason and compassion offer superior moral guidance to biblical commandments, a position informing her later socialist activism and advocacy for women's autonomy.
