description: |
  F. Max Müller's *The Silesian Horseherd: Questions of the Hour*, published in 1870, presents a collection of essays addressing the momentous political transformations of German unification and European power realignments during the Franco-Prussian War period. While Max Müller is renowned primarily as the founding figure of comparative philology and Sanskrit studies who introduced the Rigveda and Indian philosophy to Western scholarship, this work reveals his engagement with contemporary European political questions and his German nationalist sympathies despite his long residence in England. The title essay uses the allegory of a Silesian horseherd—representing the common German people—to explore questions of national identity, cultural unity, and political destiny as the German states moved toward unification under Prussian leadership. Müller addresses the relationship between cultural nationalism and political sovereignty, the role of shared language and history in constituting national identity, and the implications of German unification for European balance of power. The collection demonstrates how Müller's philological scholarship—emphasizing the Indo-European language family and shared Aryan heritage—intersected with nineteenth-century nationalist ideologies that drew on linguistic and racial theories to justify political movements. Though less directly relevant to Indian studies than his Vedic editions and works on comparative mythology, the essays illuminate the broader intellectual context of Orientalist scholarship and how European scholars' engagement with Sanskrit and Indian antiquity often served purposes of European self-definition and nationalist ideology construction.
