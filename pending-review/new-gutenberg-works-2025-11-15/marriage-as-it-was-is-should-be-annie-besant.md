description: |
  *Marriage: As It Was, As It Is, and As It Should Be*, published in 1878, represents Annie Besant's radical feminist critique of Victorian marriage institutions and her progressive vision for transformed gender relations based on equality, consent, and mutual respect. Written shortly after the notorious 1877 Bradlaugh-Besant trial that made her Britain's most controversial female public figure, the pamphlet synthesizes historical analysis of marriage's evolution, scathing critique of contemporary marriage laws denying women legal personhood and property rights, and constructive proposals for institutional reform. Besant documents how Victorian coverture laws rendered married women legally non-existent, subordinated to husbands' absolute authority over property, children, and personal freedom. She exposes the economic coercion forcing women into marriage as survival strategy rather than free choice, the sexual double standards permitting male infidelity while requiring female purity, and the legal frameworks enabling marital rape and domestic violence without recourse. Beyond critique, Besant proposes reforms including married women's property rights, divorce law liberalization, birth control access, economic independence for women, and reconceptualizing marriage as partnership between equals rather than patriarchal ownership. The work participated in Victorian women's rights movements while exceeding their typical moderation through Besant's characteristic intellectual radicalism and willingness to challenge fundamental social institutions.

# Marriage: As It Was, As It Is, and As It Should Be

## Overview

Published in 1878 as a political pamphlet by the Freethought Publishing Company, *Marriage: As It Was, As It Is, and As It Should Be* represents Annie Besant's systematic feminist critique of Victorian marriage institutions and her radical vision for reconstructing gender relations on egalitarian foundations. Written when Besant was thirty-one years old and at the height of her notoriety following the 1877 obscenity trial for publishing birth control information, the work combines historical analysis, legal critique, moral philosophy, and political advocacy in characteristically fierce polemic.

The pamphlet's tripartite structure traces marriage from historical origins through contemporary Victorian practice to proposed reforms. Besant argues that marriage evolved from primitive capture and purchase arrangements through various patriarchal forms that consistently subordinated women to male authority. Victorian marriage law, she demonstrates, represented only slight improvement over earlier systems—married women remained legally non-existent under coverture doctrine, property and earnings belonged to husbands, children were legally fathers' property, and divorce remained practically impossible for most women. Against this oppressive system, Besant proposes revolutionary reforms: legal equality for married women, liberalized divorce, birth control access, economic independence, and reconceptualizing marriage as voluntary partnership between equals capable of dissolution when affection ceases.

The work scandalized Victorian respectability through its frank discussion of sexuality, its challenge to marriage's sacred character, and its author's notorious reputation. Yet it articulated grievances shared by many Victorian women trapped in unhappy marriages without legal recourse, contributing to reform movements that gradually achieved married women's property rights, divorce law reform, and expanded women's legal personhood.

## Historical Context and Besant's Circumstances

### Victorian Marriage Law

When Besant wrote in 1878, married women in England existed under common law doctrine of coverture—legal fiction that marriage merged husband and wife into single legal entity represented exclusively by the husband. Practical consequences included:

**Property Rights**: Upon marriage, a woman's property became her husband's. Any money she earned, inheritances she received, and possessions she owned transferred to his control. She could not make contracts, sue or be sued, or conduct business without his consent.

**Custody Rights**: Children were legally father's property. In separation or divorce, fathers retained custody rights; mothers had no legal claim to their children regardless of circumstances.

**Domicile**: Wives were legally required to live wherever husbands chose. Refusal constituted desertion justifying loss of support.

**Legal Identity**: Married women couldn't testify in court independently, couldn't be convicted of most crimes committed in husbands' presence (assumed to be under husbands' coercion), and essentially had no separate legal existence.

**Marital Rape**: No legal concept of marital rape existed—marriage constituted permanent sexual consent that wives couldn't withdraw.

**Divorce**: Until the 1857 Matrimonial Causes Act, divorce required expensive private Act of Parliament, practically impossible for all but wealthy. The 1857 Act allowed judicial divorce but maintained sexual double standard—husbands could divorce for simple adultery, but wives needed to prove adultery plus additional offense (cruelty, desertion, incest, bigamy).

This legal framework made marriage profoundly risky for women—entering marriage meant surrendering legal personhood to husband's authority with minimal recourse against abuse, exploitation, or abandonment.

### Besant's Personal Experience

Besant wrote from painful personal experience. Her 1867 marriage to Reverend Frank Besant had deteriorated due to religious disagreements, intellectual incompatibility, and Frank's authoritarian temperament. After separating in 1873, Annie faced severe consequences: she retained custody of daughter Mabel but lost son Arthur; she had no legal claim to marital property; and as separated woman neither married nor independent, she occupied socially ambiguous, economically precarious position.

Her involvement in the 1877 birth control trial resulted in losing custody of Mabel as well—courts ruled that publishing information about contraception demonstrated moral unfitness for motherhood. This devastating loss intensified Besant's commitment to reforming laws that gave fathers absolute custody rights regardless of mothers' actual caregiving or fathers' character.

The pamphlet thus combined intellectual analysis with lived experience of marriage's legal and personal oppressions, lending particular force to her critiques.

### The Women's Movement

Besant wrote during emergence of organized British feminism. The 1860s-1870s saw:

**Married Women's Property Campaigns**: Activists including Barbara Bodichon and the Langham Place Group campaigned for married women's property rights, achieving partial reforms in 1870 and more comprehensive legislation in 1882.

**Educational Access**: Women fought for university admission, professional training, and educational equality.

**Employment Rights**: Campaigns to open professions and expand employment opportunities beyond domestic service, needlework, and teaching.

**Suffrage Movement**: Organized campaigns for women's voting rights, though full suffrage wouldn't come until 1918 (limited) and 1928 (equal).

**Social Purity Movement**: Campaigns against prostitution, sexual double standards, and "white slavery."

Besant's pamphlet participated in these movements while exceeding their typical moderation. Mainstream women's rights activists often couched demands in terms of protecting feminine virtue and maintaining social order; Besant's secular radicalism challenged marriage's fundamental structure and sacred character, proposing revolutionary transformation rather than incremental reform.

## Structure and Arguments

### Part I: Marriage As It Was

Besant traces marriage's historical evolution through anthropological and historical evidence, arguing that institutions claimed as natural and divinely ordained actually resulted from historical processes shaped by power relations:

**Primitive Origins**: Discussion of various theories about earliest marriage forms—capture of women as war spoils, purchase of wives from families, exchange marriages between groups. Besant emphasizes that primitive marriage involved treating women as property transferred between men.

**Ancient Civilizations**: Examination of marriage in classical Greece and Rome, documenting legal subordination of wives, husbands' absolute authority, and women's exclusion from public life. Besant notes that even civilizations Europeans celebrated for cultural achievements maintained oppressive gender relations.

**Medieval Christian Marriage**: Analysis of Church's role in developing marriage doctrine emphasizing indissolubility, wifely submission based on biblical authority, and marriage's primary purpose as procreation. Besant critiques religious sanctification of patriarchal arrangements as divinely mandated rather than human constructions.

**Property and Power**: Throughout, Besant emphasizes marriage's connection to property transmission and male power—arrangements served to ensure legitimate heirs, transfer property between families, and maintain patrilineal descent, treating women as means to these ends rather than autonomous persons.

This historical section served argumentative purpose—demonstrating that current marriage arrangements weren't natural or eternal but evolved institutions shaped by power relations and thus capable of further transformation.

### Part II: Marriage As It Is

The pamphlet's central section provides devastating critique of Victorian marriage law and practice:

**Legal Subordination**: Detailed exposition of coverture doctrine and its consequences—married women's legal non-existence, property rights violations, custody denials, and enforced economic dependency.

**Economic Coercion**: Analysis of how women's limited economic opportunities forced marriage as survival strategy. Without access to education, professional training, or well-paid employment, middle-class women faced choice between marriage (however unsuitable) or poverty. Working-class women's low wages similarly made marriage economic necessity.

**Sexual Double Standards**: Critique of moral standards permitting male sexual freedom while requiring female premarital virginity and marital fidelity. Besant notes how prostitution's existence revealed hypocrisy—society condemned "fallen women" while tolerating male clients and profiting from women's economic desperation.

**Marital Rape and Abuse**: Frank discussion (shocking for Victorian audiences) of how marriage law authorized sexual coercion and provided no protection against domestic violence. Besant describes marriage as potentially legalizing rape and assault, with wives having no recourse against abusive husbands.

**Excessive Childbearing**: Exposition of how women's health was destroyed by constant pregnancy without access to birth control. Besant connects this to her advocacy for contraception—she presents birth control as crucial for women's health, family welfare, and women's capacity for life beyond childbearing.

**Divorce Barriers**: Discussion of how divorce law's expense, sexual double standards, and social stigma trapped women in miserable marriages. Even when grounds existed, poverty, loss of children, and social ostracism made divorce practically impossible for most women.

**Romantic Ideology**: Critique of Victorian romantic ideology portraying marriage as women's highest fulfillment and duty. Besant exposes how this ideology justified subordination—women were told they should find happiness in self-sacrifice and submission, blaming themselves for unhappiness rather than oppressive institutions.

This section's power derived from Besant's combination of legal analysis, moral philosophy, and practical examples demonstrating Victorian marriage's systematic injustices.

### Part III: Marriage As It Should Be

The final section proposes reforms ranging from immediately achievable to revolutionary:

**Legal Equality**: Married women should possess same legal rights as unmarried women and men—property ownership, contract rights, custody rights, legal identity. Besant advocates complete abolition of coverture.

**Economic Independence**: Women need access to education, professional training, and employment enabling economic self-sufficiency. Marriage should be choice made from desire for companionship, not economic desperation.

**Liberalized Divorce**: Divorce should be accessible based on mutual incompatibility, not requiring proof of fault. When affection ceases, couples should separate without stigma or economic devastation.

**Birth Control Access**: Women must control their reproductive capacity through access to contraceptive information and methods. Besant presents this as fundamental to women's health, autonomy, and equality.

**Transformed Understanding**: Most radically, Besant proposes reconceptualizing marriage entirely—not as sacred, permanent institution where women submit to husbands, but as voluntary partnership between equals, sustained by mutual affection and respect, dissolvable when these cease. Marriage should serve partners' welfare and development, not property transmission or social control.

**Sexual Ethics**: Development of sexual ethics based on mutual consent, respect, and equality rather than property rights and male privilege. Besant suggests that truly ethical sexual relations require equality and genuine consent impossible under current power imbalances.

These proposals positioned Besant at the radical edge of Victorian feminism—many women's rights advocates sought specific legal reforms while maintaining marriage's basic structure; Besant questioned the institution fundamentally.

## Rhetorical Strategies and Style

### Secular Framework

Unlike many Victorian women's rights advocates who argued from Christian principles, Besant employed explicitly secular reasoning—appeals to justice, equality, human welfare, and rational analysis rather than biblical authority or divine will. This reflected her freethought commitments while potentially limiting appeal to religiously conventional audiences.

### Historical Analysis

The tripartite historical structure provided rhetorical advantage—demonstrating that current arrangements resulted from historical evolution undercut claims about natural or divinely mandated gender relations. If marriage had changed historically, it could change further.

### Moral Urgency

Besant wrote with passionate moral urgency, employing vivid examples of suffering caused by unjust laws—women trapped in abusive marriages, mothers losing children, widows impoverished by property laws. This emotional appeal complemented rational argumentation.

### Confrontational Tone

Besant's style was characteristically confrontational rather than conciliatory. She directly challenged religious authority, conventional morality, and masculine privilege rather than seeking gradual reform through gentle persuasion. This reflected both her personality and political analysis—she believed fundamental injustices required direct challenge, not apologetic requests.

### Personal Authority

Though not explicitly autobiographical, Besant's personal experience of marital oppression and custody loss informed the text's authority. Readers knew she wrote from painful lived experience, not abstract theorizing.

## Reception and Impact

### Contemporary Controversy

The pamphlet generated predictable controversy. Conservative reviewers condemned Besant's attack on marriage's sacred character, her frank discussion of sexuality, her advocacy for birth control and easy divorce. Religious publications denounced the work as immoral and socially destructive.

However, the pamphlet also reached audiences experiencing similar frustrations with marital oppression—women trapped in unhappy marriages, feminists seeking systematic analysis of gender inequality, freethinkers questioning traditional institutions. For these readers, Besant articulated grievances they felt but couldn't publicly express.

### Contribution to Reform Movements

While Besant's radical proposals weren't immediately implemented, the pamphlet contributed to broader reform momentum:

**Married Women's Property Acts** (1870, 1882): Gradually dismantled coverture, granting married women property rights.

**Custody Law Reform**: Incremental reforms expanding mothers' custody rights.

**Divorce Law Evolution**: Gradual reduction in divorce costs and grounds, though full equality took decades.

**Birth Control Movement**: Besant's advocacy, despite legal prosecution, advanced contraceptive information dissemination and acceptance.

The pamphlet's radical critique may have made moderate reforms seem reasonable by comparison, expanding the Overton window of acceptable debate.

### Feminist Intellectual History

*Marriage: As It Was, As It Is, and As It Should Be* represents important text in feminist intellectual history—an early systematic critique of marriage as patriarchal institution requiring fundamental reconstruction. It influenced subsequent feminist theorists including Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Emma Goldman, and others who questioned marriage's traditional forms.

The work demonstrates Victorian feminism's diversity—alongside moderate reformers seeking specific legal changes worked radical critics questioning fundamental institutional structures. Besant exemplified this radical strand, willing to challenge sacred institutions and conventional morality.

## Limitations and Critiques

### Class Perspective

Besant wrote primarily from middle-class perspective, focusing on legal disabilities affecting propertied women. Working-class women faced additional oppressions—economic exploitation, limited employment options, lack of education—that received less attention than property and custody laws primarily affecting women with property to lose.

### Heteronormativity

The pamphlet assumes exclusively heterosexual framework, not considering same-sex relationships or alternatives to heterosexual marriage. This reflected Victorian conceptual limitations rather than specific hostility, but nonetheless constrained the analysis.

### Individualist Framework

Despite evolving toward socialism, Besant's 1878 analysis remained largely individualist—emphasizing legal equality and personal autonomy without fully addressing structural economic relations underlying gender oppression. Her later socialist work would develop more systematic economic analysis.

### Victorian Anthropology

The historical section relies on Victorian anthropological theories about primitive societies that subsequent research has challenged or rejected. Some claims about earliest marriage forms reflect now-discredited evolutionary schemes rather than empirical evidence.

## Legacy and Contemporary Relevance

### Historical Achievement

Despite limitations, *Marriage: As It Was, As It Is, and As It Should Be* represents remarkable achievement—comprehensive feminist critique of Victorian marriage in accessible pamphlet form, combining historical analysis, legal critique, and constructive proposals. Few Victorian texts matched its radical thoroughness in questioning marriage's fundamental structure.

### Ongoing Relevance

Many issues Besant addressed remain contested:

- Marital rape laws (not criminalized in England until 1991)
- Reproductive autonomy and birth control access
- Divorce law and no-fault divorce
- Economic barriers forcing relationship choices
- Sexual ethics based on genuine equality and consent
- Alternative relationship structures beyond traditional marriage

Contemporary feminist theory continues engaging questions Besant raised about whether reforming marriage suffices or whether the institution requires more fundamental transformation or rejection.

### Women's Rights History

The pamphlet documents Victorian women's rights movement's radical wing, reminding contemporary readers that feminism has always included diverse positions ranging from incremental reform to revolutionary transformation. Besant's willingness to challenge fundamental institutions provides historical example for contemporary activists questioning whether reform alone adequately addresses systematic injustices.
