description: |
  *Behind the News: Voices from Goa's Press*, compiled in 1963, documents the critical role of journalism and print media in Goa's liberation movement and transition from Portuguese colonial rule to Indian integration. The collection brings together writings, editorials, and reportage from Goan newspapers during the tense period surrounding India's 1961 annexation of the Portuguese colony after 451 years of European control. These voices from Goa's indigenous press reveal local perspectives on colonialism, nationalism, and the complex political negotiations surrounding decolonization. The work captures the unique position of Goan journalists who navigated Portuguese censorship while advocating for integration with independent India, documenting their strategic use of print media to mobilize public opinion and chronicle political developments. The collection illuminates how Goan intellectuals and press workers participated in anti-colonial resistance through journalism, creating a vernacular public sphere that challenged Portuguese narratives and asserted Goan identity within the broader Indian independence movement. As a primary source, the anthology provides invaluable insight into regional journalism history, colonial press dynamics, and the role of media in decolonization struggles, representing an understudied dimension of Indian independence historiography focused on a territory whose liberation came fourteen years after the rest of the subcontinent.
