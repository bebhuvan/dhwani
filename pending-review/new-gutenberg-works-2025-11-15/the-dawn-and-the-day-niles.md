description: |
  Henry Thayer Niles's *The Dawn and the Day; Or, The Buddha and the Christ*, published in 1902, presents an ambitious epic poem comparing the lives, teachings, and spiritual significance of Gautama Buddha and Jesus Christ as parallel manifestations of divine truth. Written in verse reminiscent of Edwin Arnold's *The Light of Asia*, Niles's work reflects turn-of-the-century fascination with comparative religion and the conviction that major world religions represented culturally varied expressions of universal spiritual principles. The poem narrates key episodes from both Buddha's and Christ's lives—birth, spiritual awakening, teaching ministry, and death—emphasizing thematic parallels in their compassionate ethics, renunciation of worldly power, and messages of spiritual transformation. Niles approached his subject with sympathetic reverence for both traditions, presenting Buddhism and Christianity not as rival systems but as complementary revelations suited to different cultural contexts and historical moments. The work participated in the broader nineteenth-century "Oriental Renaissance" that sought to integrate Asian philosophical traditions into Western religious thought, influenced by Transcendentalism, Theosophy, and liberal Protestant theology open to non-Christian wisdom traditions. While reflecting Victorian assumptions about universal religious evolution and Western interpretative frameworks, Niles's comparative approach demonstrates early interfaith dialogue and represents the period's efforts to understand Buddhism as a sophisticated ethical and philosophical system worthy of serious theological engagement alongside Christianity.
