  *The Religion of the Samurai*, published in 1913, presents one of the earliest comprehensive English-language studies of Zen Buddhism by a Japanese Zen practitioner and scholar, examining how Zen spiritual teachings and meditation practices shaped samurai warrior culture, Japanese aesthetics, and broader East Asian civilization. Written by Kaiten Nukariya (1867-1934), a Sōtō Zen priest and professor at Harvard and other institutions, the work traces Zen's historical development from Indian Buddhist origins through Chinese Chan Buddhism to Japanese Zen, demonstrating connections to Indian philosophical foundations while explaining Zen's distinctive character—emphasis on direct experiential realization over scriptural study, meditation (zazen) as core practice, paradoxical teaching methods (koans), transmission from master to disciple, and integration with daily life including martial arts, tea ceremony, calligraphy, and garden design. Nukariya explains how Zen particularly influenced samurai class by providing philosophical framework for confronting death fearlessly, acting decisively without deliberation, maintaining mental clarity under pressure, and cultivating spiritual discipline alongside martial training. The work synthesizes historical scholarship, philosophical analysis, and insider practitioner perspective, introducing Western audiences to Zen's Indian Buddhist roots (meditation practices from dhyana, Mahayana philosophy of emptiness and Buddha-nature), Chinese development, and Japanese cultural expressions. This pioneering study influenced subsequent Western understanding of Zen and contributed to broader twentieth-century Western interest in Buddhist meditation, Eastern philosophy, and Japanese culture.

# The Religion of the Samurai: A Study of Zen Philosophy and Discipline in China and Japan

## Overview

Published in 1913, *The Religion of the Samurai* represents one of the first comprehensive English-language studies of Zen Buddhism written by a Japanese Zen practitioner for Western audiences. The author, Kaiten Nukariya (1867-1934), was Sōtō Zen priest, scholar, and professor who taught at Harvard, Heidelberg, and several Japanese universities, bringing unique combination of insider practitioner knowledge, academic training, and cross-cultural communication ability to explaining Zen's complex philosophical, historical, and practical dimensions.

The work's central thesis examines how Zen Buddhism—Japanese development of Chinese Chan, itself rooted in Indian Buddhist meditation traditions—profoundly influenced samurai warrior culture, Japanese aesthetics, and East Asian civilization more broadly. Nukariya demonstrates that Zen wasn't merely philosophical system or religious doctrine but comprehensive way of life integrating spiritual discipline with daily activities including martial arts, governance, arts, and crafts. The samurai class particularly embraced Zen because its teachings addressed warriors' existential situation: confronting death regularly, needing to act decisively without paralyzing deliberation, maintaining mental clarity under extreme pressure, and finding meaning in service and discipline.

Nukariya traces Zen's development from Indian Buddhist origins—particularly meditation practices (dhyana in Sanskrit, chan in Chinese, zen in Japanese) and Mahayana philosophical concepts of emptiness (shunyata), Buddha-nature, and non-duality—through its Chinese elaboration under teachers like Bodhidharma, Huineng, and subsequent Chan patriarchs, to its Japanese flowering during medieval period when Zen profoundly shaped samurai culture, aesthetics, and social institutions. The work explains distinctive Zen characteristics: emphasis on direct experiential realization (satori/kensho) over scriptural study, meditation (zazen) as core practice, paradoxical teaching methods (koans), mind-to-mind transmission from master to disciple, and integration with practical activities.

For Western audiences in 1913, *The Religion of the Samurai* provided accessible yet sophisticated introduction to Zen Buddhism during period of growing Western interest in Asian religions, comparative philosophy, and meditation practices. The work influenced subsequent Western Zen teachers, scholars, and practitioners while contributing to broader twentieth-century engagement with Buddhist thought, meditation, and Eastern philosophy. It remains valuable both as historical document of early Zen studies in English and as substantive introduction to Zen's philosophical foundations, historical development, and cultural influence.

## The Author: Kaiten Nukariya

### Buddhist Scholar and Cultural Ambassador

Kaiten Nukariya (1867-1934) belonged to remarkable generation of Meiji-era Japanese intellectuals who engaged Western scholarship while interpreting Japanese traditions for international audiences during Japan's rapid modernization.

**Religious Background**: Ordained as Sōtō Zen priest, Nukariya practiced within one of Japan's major Zen lineages (alongside Rinzai and Ōbaku schools). This provided insider understanding of Zen meditation, monastic discipline, and teaching methods.

**Academic Training**: Nukariya studied philosophy at Tokyo Imperial University and pursued graduate work in Europe and America, including time at Harvard University. This Western academic training equipped him to present Zen using philosophical and historical methodologies comprehensible to Western readers.

**Cross-Cultural Mission**: Writing in English for Western audiences, Nukariya sought to correct misconceptions about Buddhism generally and Zen particularly, while demonstrating Japanese spiritual traditions' philosophical sophistication. His work contributed to mutual understanding during period of increasing Japanese-Western interaction.

**Historical Moment**: The book appeared during what scholar Thomas Tweed calls American Buddhism's "first wave"—late nineteenth and early twentieth century when Asian immigrants, World Parliament of Religions (1893), and scholars like Paul Carus introduced Buddhist ideas to American audiences. Nukariya's work provided authoritative voice from practicing Zen Buddhist explaining tradition from within.

## Indian Buddhist Foundations of Zen

### The Buddha and Meditation Practice

Nukariya begins by establishing Zen's roots in Indian Buddhism, particularly meditation practices taught by historical Buddha (Siddhartha Gautama, c. 5th century BCE):

**Dhyana/Meditation**: The Sanskrit term *dhyana* (meditation, mental cultivation) became *chan* in Chinese and *zen* in Japanese. Buddha's enlightenment came through meditation, and he taught meditation as essential practice for awakening—not mere intellectual understanding but direct experiential realization.

**Four Noble Truths**: Buddha's core teaching identified suffering (dukkha), its origin in craving/attachment (tanha), the possibility of suffering's cessation (nirvana), and the path to cessation (Eightfold Path including right meditation). Zen emphasizes direct realization of these truths through meditation rather than philosophical analysis.

**No-Self (Anatman)**: Buddha taught that no permanent, unchanging self exists—what we call "self" is conventional designation for constantly changing aggregates (skandhas) of physical form, feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness. Zen meditation aims at directly experiencing this no-self teaching.

**Middle Way**: Buddha rejected both extreme asceticism and sensual indulgence, teaching middle path. Zen similarly avoids both excessive intellectualism and anti-intellectual rejection of study, both attachment to form and formless abstraction.

### Mahayana Buddhism: Philosophical Foundation

Nukariya emphasizes Zen's grounding in Mahayana Buddhism (the "Great Vehicle" tradition dominant in East Asia, Tibet, and Vietnam):

**Emptiness (Shunyata)**: Developed particularly by Nagarjuna (c. 2nd century CE), emptiness teaching holds that all phenomena lack inherent, independent existence—everything exists only relationally, interdependently. This doesn't mean nothing exists but that existence is radically relational rather than substantial. Zen realization involves directly perceiving emptiness—not as philosophical concept but as lived reality.

**Buddha-Nature (Tathagatagarbha)**: Mahayana texts teach that all beings possess Buddha-nature—inherent capacity for awakening. Enlightenment isn't acquiring something external but realizing what already is. Zen emphasizes this teaching strongly—practice reveals rather than creates Buddha-nature.

**Non-Duality**: Mahayana philosophy challenges dualistic thinking—subject/object, self/other, nirvana/samsara, form/emptiness. The Heart Sutra's famous statement "form is emptiness, emptiness is form" expresses this non-dual vision. Zen meditation cultivates non-dual awareness.

**Upaya (Skillful Means)**: Mahayana teaching that enlightened teachers use whatever methods suit students' capacities—no single fixed doctrine or practice. This justifies Zen's unconventional methods (shouting, hitting, paradoxical statements) as skillful means for triggering awakening.

**Bodhisattva Ideal**: Unlike earlier Buddhism's arhat (individual liberation), Mahayana emphasizes bodhisattva—one who vows to achieve enlightenment for all beings' benefit, postponing final nirvana until all are liberated. Zen practitioners take bodhisattva vows, emphasizing compassion alongside wisdom.

These Mahayana concepts, rooted in Indian Buddhist philosophical development, provided theoretical framework for Zen's practical emphasis.

## Chinese Chan Buddhism: Historical Development

### Bodhidharma and Transmission to China

Nukariya traces Zen's Chinese development beginning with semi-legendary figure Bodhidharma (c. 5th-6th century CE), Indian or Central Asian monk who allegedly brought meditation Buddhism to China:

**Direct Pointing**: Bodhidharma reportedly taught "direct pointing to the mind"—bypassing scriptures and intellectual study to directly realize Buddha-nature through meditation. Famous stories depict him meditating facing wall for nine years, cutting off eyelids to prevent drowsiness, and responding to Chinese emperor's questions about merit from religious activities by declaring "No merit!"—emphasizing realization over ritualistic accumulation.

**Mind-to-Mind Transmission**: Zen claims "special transmission outside scriptures, not dependent on words and letters"—awakening transmitted directly from teacher's enlightened mind to student's, verified through demonstration rather than doctrinal conformity.

**Encounter with Daoism**: Chinese Buddhism encountered Daoist philosophy (Laozi, Zhuangzi) emphasizing naturalness, spontaneity, ineffability of Dao, and paradoxical expression. Chan Buddhism absorbed Daoist elements—naturalness, simplicity, paradox, and suspicion of conceptual elaboration—while maintaining Buddhist framework of suffering's cessation through meditation.

### The Platform Sutra and Huineng

Nukariya emphasizes Huineng (638-713), Sixth Patriarch of Chan, whose *Platform Sutra* became foundational text:

**Sudden vs. Gradual Enlightenment**: Huineng's awakening story—illiterate temple worker who composed enlightened verse surpassing learned monks'—established "sudden enlightenment" teaching: awakening can occur instantly rather than requiring gradual cultivation. This doesn't negate practice's importance but emphasizes breakthrough insight's possibility.

**Original Mind**: Huineng taught that mind is originally pure, enlightened—defilements are superficial clouds obscuring sun rather than sun's transformation. Practice involves recognizing original nature rather than gradually purifying defiled substance.

**No-Thought (Wu-Nien)**: Not absence of thinking but non-attachment to thoughts—thoughts arise and pass without clinging or elaboration. This mental stance allows natural wisdom without conceptual mediation.

**Non-Dual Practice**: Huineng rejected meditation conceived as withdrawing from world to cultivate concentration separately from daily life. Instead, enlightened mind manifests in ordinary activities—walking, sitting, working. No sacred/profane split; meditation and daily life interpenetrate.

### Tang Dynasty Flowering

Nukariya describes Chan's golden age during Tang Dynasty (618-907), when great masters developed distinctive teaching styles:

**Mazu Daoyi (709-788)**: Known for unconventional methods—hitting, shouting, unpredictable responses. Taught "ordinary mind is the Way"—enlightenment isn't special altered state but clear recognition of ordinary experience's nature.

**Baizhang Huaihai (720-814)**: Established monastic work practice with rule "a day without work is a day without food"—integrating manual labor into contemplative life, erasing distinction between meditation hall and fields.

**Linji Yixuan (d. 866)**: Founder of Linji (Rinzai in Japanese) lineage, emphasized intense personal encounter between master and student, dramatic techniques for breaking conceptual thinking, and cultivation of "host" rather than "guest"—being subject of one's experience rather than passively observing.

**Yunmen Wenyan (864-949)**: Known for terse, cryptic responses; developed "critical phrase" method—single word or phrase capturing teaching's essence.

These masters developed teaching methods later systematized as koans (paradoxical questions or stories used in meditation).

## Zen in Japan: Cultural Integration

### Transmission to Japan

Nukariya traces Zen's Japanese development:

**Early Introduction**: Chinese Chan teachings reached Japan during Nara (710-794) and Heian (794-1185) periods but initially made limited impact, overshadowed by Tendai and Shingon schools.

**Eisai (1141-1215)**: Founder of Japanese Rinzai Zen, studied in China and brought Linji Chan to Japan. His *Kōzen Gokokuron* (Promotion of Zen for the Protection of the Country) argued that Zen Buddhism could strengthen nation—appealing to samurai class and ruling authorities.

**Dōgen (1200-1253)**: Founder of Japanese Sōtō Zen (Nukariya's tradition), studied in China and brought Caodong Chan to Japan. His *Shōbōgenzō* (Treasury of the True Dharma Eye) presents sophisticated philosophical exposition of Zen realization. Emphasized *shikantaza* (just sitting)—meditation without concentration objects, koans, or goals beyond sitting itself.

**Medieval Flourishing**: During Kamakura (1185-1333) and Muromachi (1336-1573) periods, Zen profoundly influenced Japanese culture through samurai patronage, monastic institutions, and cultural arts.

### The Samurai-Zen Connection

Nukariya's central focus is explaining why samurai warriors embraced Zen:

**Confronting Death**: Samurai faced death regularly—in battle, through ritual suicide (seppuku), and via execution. Zen meditation on impermanence and no-self helped warriors accept mortality without paralyzing fear. Famous saying "Die before you die" meant psychologically accepting death, allowing fearless action.

**Decisive Action**: Battlefield situations require split-second decisions without time for deliberation. Zen training cultivates *mushin* (no-mind)—spontaneous appropriate response without conceptual mediation. Paralysis through overthinking means death; Zen enables direct, immediate action.

**Mental Clarity**: Warriors need clear perception under extreme stress. Zen meditation develops *joriki* (concentration power) and mental clarity undisturbed by emotional turbulence, pain, or chaos.

**Simplicity and Discipline**: Samurai culture valued austerity, self-discipline, and mastery through repetition—values mirrored in Zen's minimalist aesthetics and emphasis on rigorous practice.

**Service Ethic**: Bushido (way of the warrior) emphasized loyalty and service above personal survival. Zen's bodhisattva ideal—acting for others' benefit—resonated with this samurai ethic.

**Status and Power**: Practically, Zen monasteries offered education, cultural sophistication, and political connections valuable to ruling samurai class.

## Zen Practice and Philosophy

### Zazen: Seated Meditation

Nukariya explains Zen meditation's centrality:

**Posture**: Cross-legged sitting position (lotus or half-lotus), straight spine, hands in cosmic mudra, eyes slightly open gazing downward. Physical posture embodies and facilitates mental clarity.

**Breath**: Natural breathing—often counting breaths or following breath's movement without manipulation. Breath serves as anchor preventing mental wandering.

**Approaches**:
- **Shikantaza** (Sōtō emphasis): "Just sitting" without concentration object or koan—allowing mind to settle into natural clarity
- **Koan Practice** (Rinzai emphasis): Concentrating on paradoxical question/story (e.g., "What is the sound of one hand clapping?") until conceptual thinking exhausts itself and insight breaks through

**Mind Training**: Meditation cultivates:
- Concentration (*samadhi*)—mental stability and focus
- Mindfulness—clear awareness of present experience without judgment
- Insight (*prajna*)—direct realization of emptiness, no-self, Buddha-nature

### Koans: Paradoxical Teaching

Nukariya explains koan practice's role:

**Origin**: Developed from Tang Dynasty masters' dialogues and teaching encounters, later systematized into formal study curriculum.

**Famous Examples**:
- Zhaozhou's "Mu" (Does dog have Buddha-nature? Mu!)
- Yunmen's "Shit-stick" (What is Buddha? A dried shit-stick!)
- Linji's "True Person of No Rank"
- Hakuin's "Sound of one hand"

**Purpose**: Koans aren't intellectual puzzles requiring clever answers but meditation objects designed to:
- Exhaust conceptual thinking's limits
- Generate "great doubt" that intensifies seeking
- Trigger breakthrough realization
- Test and verify understanding depth
- Train capacity for paradoxical/non-dual awareness

**Practice**: Students concentrate on koan during meditation and daily life until answer comes from non-conceptual understanding—verified through interview with master (sanzen/dokusan).

### Satori/Kensho: Awakening Experience

The goal is direct experiential realization:

**Satori**: Zen awakening—not permanent state necessarily but breakthrough insight into emptiness, no-self, Buddha-nature. Can be sudden, dramatic experience or subtle shift in perception.

**Characteristics**: Often described as:
- Seeing into one's nature
- Death and rebirth
- Bottom falling out of bucket
- Scales falling from eyes
- Original face before parents' birth

**Verification**: Unlike private mystical experience, satori is tested through interviews with master who can distinguish genuine insight from emotional states or intellectual understanding.

**Post-Satori Practice**: Awakening isn't practice's end but beginning of actualizing realization in daily life—"After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water."

### Integration with Daily Life

Nukariya emphasizes Zen's practical manifestation:

**Work Practice**: Manual labor as meditation—gardening, cleaning, cooking performed with full attention and presence.

**Martial Arts**: Zen influenced archery, swordsmanship, martial arts through cultivating no-mind, spontaneous response, and integration of training with spiritual practice. Eugen Herrigel's later *Zen in the Art of Archery* (1948) popularized this dimension.

**Arts**:
- **Tea Ceremony** (chanoyu): Ritualized simplicity, presence, and aesthetic appreciation
- **Calligraphy** (shodō): Spontaneous expression of mind's state through brush
- **Poetry** (haiku): Capturing moment's immediacy in minimal words
- **Garden Design**: Expressing naturalness, simplicity, and emptiness through rocks, sand, minimal vegetation
- **Ink Painting** (sumi-e): Suggesting essence through minimal brushstrokes

**Aesthetics**: Zen aesthetic values—wabi (rustic simplicity), sabi (elegant simplicity, patina of age), ma (negative space), yugen (profound mystery)—influenced all Japanese arts.

## Zen's Cultural Influence

### Impact on Japanese Civilization

Nukariya demonstrates Zen's pervasive influence:

**Education**: Zen monasteries served as educational institutions, teaching Chinese classics, calligraphy, and cultural arts.

**Governance**: Many samurai rulers practiced Zen, and Zen advisors influenced political decisions.

**Philosophy**: Zen thought influenced Japanese intellectual history—concepts of naturalness, spontaneity, simplicity, and acceptance.

**Architecture**: Temple design, garden layout, tea houses reflected Zen aesthetic principles.

**Ethics**: Zen influenced bushido (samurai code), emphasizing discipline, loyalty, confronting death, and service.

### Contrast with Other Buddhist Schools

Nukariya distinguishes Zen from other Japanese Buddhist traditions:

**Pure Land** (Jōdo): Emphasized faith in Amida Buddha's vow to save all beings who call his name—easier path for ordinary people. Zen instead stressed self-power through meditation.

**Tendai**: Eclectic synthesis including esoteric rituals, Lotus Sutra devotion, meditation. Zen simplified to meditation focus.

**Shingon**: Esoteric Buddhism emphasizing ritual, mantra, mandala. Zen rejected elaborate ritual for direct meditation.

**Nichiren**: Focused exclusively on Lotus Sutra. Zen claimed transmission beyond scriptures.

Zen's appeal to samurai partly reflected its masculine, disciplined, self-reliant character versus other schools' greater emphasis on devotion, ritual, or external salvation.

## Western Reception and Influence

### Early Western Engagement

Nukariya's 1913 work contributed to growing Western interest:

**Transcendentalism**: Earlier, Emerson and Thoreau had encountered Asian texts through translation, but understanding remained limited.

**Theosophy**: Blavatsky and colleagues introduced Buddhist concepts but often inaccurately through Western esoteric lens.

**World Parliament of Religions** (1893): Shaku Sōen, Rinzai Zen master, presented Buddhism—beginning more direct contact.

**D.T. Suzuki**: Shaku Sōen's student Daisetsu Teitaro Suzuki (1870-1966) became most influential interpreter of Zen for West through extensive English writings—though his presentation sometimes emphasized dramatic elements (satori, koans, paradox) while downplaying gradual practice and institutional Buddhism.

Nukariya's work provided more balanced, scholarly introduction than Suzuki's later popularizations.

### Twentieth-Century Impact

Zen profoundly influenced Western culture:

**Beat Generation**: Jack Kerouac, Gary Snyder, Allen Ginsberg embraced Zen (often romanticized version) as alternative to Western materialism and conformity.

**Psychotherapy**: Zen influenced humanistic and transpersonal psychology, mindfulness-based therapies, and Western approaches to meditation.

**Arts**: Zen aesthetics influenced modernist poetry, abstract art, minimalist music (John Cage), and design.

**Philosophy**: Western philosophers (Martin Heidegger, later phenomenologists) engaged Zen thought in cross-cultural dialogue.

**Meditation**: Zen contributed to secularized mindfulness practices now widespread in medicine, education, and psychology.

**Popular Culture**: "Being Zen" entered vernacular meaning calm, present, accepting.

Nukariya's early scholarly work helped establish foundation for this extensive Western engagement.

## Criticism and Contemporary Perspective

### Scholarly Reassessment

Modern Zen scholarship critiques early Western presentations:

**Romanticization**: Early Western interpreters (including Nukariya somewhat) emphasized Zen's exotic, mystical, artistic dimensions while downplaying institutional Buddhism, monastic discipline, and social conservatism.

**Ahistorical Presentation**: Depicting Zen as timeless transmission from Buddha through patriarchs overlooked historical development, Chinese cultural influences, political factors, and doctrinal diversity.

**Samurai Ideology**: The Zen-samurai connection, while real, was more complex than romantic presentations suggested—Zen institutions also served ruling class interests and sometimes justified militarism.

**Modernization**: Meiji-era Japanese presentations of Zen (including Nukariya's) reflected modern reformulations influenced by Western philosophy and Japanese nationalism—not simply traditional Buddhism.

**Practice vs. Philosophy**: Overemphasis on dramatic awakening experiences and philosophical paradox sometimes obscured Zen's equally important gradual cultivation, ethical discipline, and community practice.

### Contemporary Relevance

Despite critiques, Nukariya's work retains value:

**Historical Document**: Illuminates early twentieth-century East-West encounter and Japanese self-presentation during modernization.

**Introduction to Zen**: Provides accessible yet substantive overview of Zen history, philosophy, and practice.

**Indian Buddhist Connections**: Helpfully traces Zen back to Indian Buddhist sources—meditation practices, Mahayana philosophy—showing continuity despite Zen's distinctive character.

**Cultural Context**: Explains Zen's influence on Japanese culture, samurai ethics, and artistic traditions.

**Cross-Cultural Bridge**: Represents Japanese scholar's effort to make Asian spiritual tradition comprehensible to Western audiences.
