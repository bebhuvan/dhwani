  Published simultaneously with Volume 1 in 1888, *The Secret Doctrine, Volume 2: Anthropogenesis* presents Helena Petrovna Blavatsky's elaborate account of human origins and spiritual evolution through successive "Root Races" spanning millions of years. Complementing the first volume's cosmogony, this volume synthesizes evolutionary biology, Hindu and Buddhist concepts of cyclical manifestation, comparative mythology, and Theosophical esoteric doctrine into comprehensive anthropological framework. Blavatsky describes seven Root Races developing through vast ages, from ethereal spiritual beings gradually densifying into physical forms, with humanity currently in the Fifth Root Race. Drawing extensively on Hindu Puranic accounts of Manus and yugas, Buddhist cosmological cycles, and reinterpretations of worldwide flood myths and creation stories, she presents human development as simultaneous physical and spiritual evolution guided by advanced beings. The work extensively discusses karma, reincarnation, and the evolution of consciousness as central to human destiny. Though the "Root Race" theory has been justly criticized for racial hierarchies and pseudoscientific speculation, the volume significantly influenced Western reception of Hindu and Buddhist concepts regarding reincarnation, karma, and spiritual evolution. *Anthropogenesis* shaped Theosophical anthropology and contributed to Western alternative spirituality's characteristic synthesis of evolution, ancient wisdom traditions, and progressive spiritual development.

# The Secret Doctrine, Volume 2: Anthropogenesis

## Overview

*The Secret Doctrine, Volume 2: Anthropogenesis* completes the two-volume masterwork Helena Petrovna Blavatsky published in 1888, shifting focus from cosmic origins to human evolution and spiritual development. Where Volume 1 presented cosmogony—the birth and evolution of universes—Volume 2 presents anthropogeny—the origin and evolution of humanity through successive stages spanning millions of years across multiple continents and dimensional states.

The 798-page volume is structured around twelve additional stanzas from the purported "Book of Dzyan," each receiving extensive commentary synthesizing evolutionary biology, Hindu Puranic mythology, Buddhist cosmological cycles, comparative anthropology, and esoteric tradition. Blavatsky presents human development as occurring through seven "Root Races," each subdivided into seven sub-races, with humanity currently in the Fifth Root Race (Aryan). She describes earlier Root Races as progressively densifying from ethereal spiritual beings into physical forms, inhabiting now-sunken continents including Lemuria and Atlantis.

Central to Volume 2 is Blavatsky's integration of Darwin's evolutionary theory with Hindu and Buddhist concepts of karma, reincarnation, and cyclical spiritual development. She argues that humanity evolves simultaneously on physical and spiritual planes—bodily forms developing through processes resembling Darwinian evolution while consciousness evolves through karmic cycles of rebirth toward eventual spiritual perfection. This synthesis allowed Theosophists to accept evolution's general framework while rejecting materialist reductionism and introducing spiritual teleology absent from scientific accounts.

The volume draws extensively on Hindu concepts including:
- **Manvantaras and Pralayas**: Vast cycles of manifestation and dissolution
- **Manus**: The progenitors of humanity in each cycle, corresponding to her Root Races
- **Yugas**: The four ages of progressive spiritual decline within each cycle
- **Karma and Samsara**: The law of moral causation and the cycle of rebirth
- **Moksha**: Ultimate liberation from the cycle of reincarnation

Buddhist contributions include doctrines of dependent origination, the evolution of consciousness through successive states, and cosmological frameworks describing multiple world-systems and vast time scales. Blavatsky synthesizes these Asian traditions with Kabbalistic, Hermetic, Gnostic, and comparative mythological materials into a comprehensive anthropological system.

The work profoundly influenced Western engagement with Hindu and Buddhist philosophy, popularizing concepts of reincarnation and karma among English-speaking audiences. However, the Root Race theory has been justly criticized for incorporating racial hierarchies reflecting nineteenth-century scientific racism, with Blavatsky presenting evolution as progressing through racial stages, some more "advanced" than others—a problematic legacy that requires critical examination alongside the work's historical influence.

## Structure and Content

### The Stanzas of Dzyan on Anthropogenesis

Volume 2 presents twelve additional stanzas purportedly from the Book of Dzyan, focusing on human origins and evolution. Like Volume 1, scholars question the independent existence of these stanzas, suspecting Blavatsky composed them drawing on diverse sources. The stanzas describe successive stages of human development:

**Stanza I-III**: Describe the primordial state before physical humanity, when beings existed as "self-born" spiritual entities without material form, reproducing through emanation rather than sexual generation.

**Stanza IV-VI**: Detail the gradual densification of humanity into etheric and eventually physical bodies, the development of gender differentiation, and the emergence of sexual reproduction.

**Stanza VII-IX**: Describe the Third Root Race (Lemurians) and their transformation from androgynous beings to sexually differentiated humans, the "fall into generation," and the sinking of the Lemurian continent.

**Stanza X-XII**: Narrate the Fourth Root Race (Atlanteans), their advanced civilization, eventual corruption, and the catastrophic destruction of Atlantis, followed by the emergence of the Fifth Root Race (Aryans).

### The Seven Root Races

Blavatsky's central anthropological framework describes seven Root Races, each representing major evolutionary stage:

**First Root Race - The Self-Born**: Ethereal, insubstantial beings existing in purely spiritual state without material form, inhabiting the "Imperishable Sacred Land" in the Arctic regions. These beings reproduced through emanation, projecting their consciousness into new forms.

**Second Root Race - The Sweat-Born**: Semi-ethereal beings beginning to develop subtle material form, inhabiting Hyperborea (northern polar region). They reproduced through a process Blavatsky terms "budding"—organisms dividing to create offspring, analogous to cell division.

**Third Root Race - The Lemurians**: The crucial transition to physical humanity occurred during this race. Initially androgynous beings reproducing through eggs, the Lemurians gradually developed sexual differentiation, physical bodies, and sexual reproduction. They inhabited the continent of Lemuria, stretching across the Indian Ocean. The "separation of sexes" during this period represents the "fall" of humanity into material generation. Late in this period, the "Lords of Flame" from Venus incarnated to bestow higher mind upon humanity, kindling self-consciousness and rational faculty.

**Fourth Root Race - The Atlanteans**: Inhabiting the great continent of Atlantis in the Atlantic Ocean, the Atlanteans developed advanced civilization with technology, magic, and psychic powers. However, they eventually became corrupted by materialism and misuse of occult powers. Their civilization was destroyed in a series of catastrophes spanning thousands of years, culminating in the final submergence of Atlantis approximately 11,000 years ago, preserved in worldwide flood myths including Plato's account.

**Fifth Root Race - The Aryans**: The current Root Race, emerging from Atlantean survivors and developing primarily in Central Asia before spreading globally. Blavatsky divides Aryans into sub-races including Indian, Persian, Egyptian/Chaldean, Greco-Roman, and Teutonic/Anglo-Saxon. This race focuses on intellectual and technological development, though at the cost of diminished psychic abilities the Atlanteans possessed.

**Sixth and Seventh Root Races**: Future evolutionary stages Blavatsky describes only in outline. The Sixth Root Race will develop higher spiritual capacities and eventually transcend purely physical existence, while the Seventh will complete the evolutionary cycle before humanity ascends to higher planes of existence.

### Hindu Philosophical Elements

Volume 2 extensively employs Hindu Puranic and philosophical concepts:

**The Manus**: Blavatsky correlates her Root Races with the Hindu concept of Manus—progenitors of humanity in successive ages. Hindu tradition describes fourteen Manus governing successive manvantaras (ages of manifestation). She adapts this framework, aligning her seven Root Races with the Manu-based cyclical anthropology.

**The Yugas**: Hindu doctrine of four yugas—Satya (golden age), Treta, Dvapara, and Kali (dark age)—provides temporal framework. She describes humanity as currently in Kali Yuga, the age of spiritual darkness and material focus, though approaching eventual transition to a new ascending cycle.

**Karma and Reincarnation**: Central to her anthropology is the Hindu/Buddhist doctrine of karma (moral causation) and reincarnation. Individual souls incarnate repeatedly through the Root Races, accumulating karma that determines future births, progressively developing spiritual capacities across countless lifetimes. This provides mechanism for individual spiritual evolution within the broader framework of racial evolution.

**The Seven Principles of Man**: Drawing on Vedantic and Tantric enumeration of human constitution, Blavatsky describes seven principles: physical body, etheric double, vital energy (prana), desire nature (kama), mind (manas), spiritual soul (buddhi), and pure spirit (atman). This septenary constitution connects individual human development to cosmic septenary principles described in Volume 1.

**Kundalini and Chakras**: She references the Tantric system of kundalini (coiled serpent energy) and chakras (subtle energy centers) as describing latent spiritual capacities humanity will fully develop in future evolutionary stages.

**Maya and Illusion**: The Vedantic concept of maya informs her epistemology—physical existence represents temporary, illusory manifestation of eternal spiritual reality. Material evolution occurs within the realm of maya, while true spiritual evolution transcends it.

### Buddhist Contributions

Buddhist cosmology and philosophy significantly contribute to Volume 2:

**Dependent Origination**: The Buddhist doctrine of pratityasamutpada (dependent origination)—that all phenomena arise dependently from conditions—provides framework for understanding evolutionary causation beyond both random chance and divine creation.

**The Three Kayas**: She references the Mahayana Buddhist doctrine of three bodies—Dharmakaya (truth body), Sambhogakaya (enjoyment body), and Nirmanakaya (emanation body)—as describing different levels of spiritual development and manifestation.

**Buddhist Cosmological Cycles**: Buddhist calculations of vast temporal cycles—kalpas spanning billions of years—support her claims regarding the immense time scales of Root Race evolution, exceeding even generous geological estimates of her era.

**Bodhisattvas and Advanced Beings**: She describes the "Lords of Flame" and other advanced beings guiding human evolution using Buddhist terminology of Bodhisattvas—enlightened beings who delay final liberation to assist others' spiritual development.

**Evolution of Consciousness**: Buddhist analysis of consciousness and its development through meditation and spiritual practice informs her account of consciousness evolution across Root Races and individual incarnations.

## Engagement with Darwinian Evolution

Blavatsky extensively engages Darwin's evolutionary theory, published in *Origin of Species* (1859) three decades before *The Secret Doctrine*. Her relationship to Darwinism is complex—simultaneously accepting and critiquing it:

### Acceptance of Evolution

She accepts evolution's fundamental premise—that life forms develop and transform over vast time periods through gradual processes. She praises Darwin for challenging biblical literalism and introducing scientific understanding of life's development.

### Critique of Materialist Mechanism

However, she rejects the materialist interpretation that evolution occurs through random variation and natural selection without spiritual purpose. She argues:

**Spiritual Teleology**: Evolution is guided by spiritual intelligences (Dhyan Chohans, Lords of Flame) toward predetermined spiritual ends, not mechanically driven by random mutation.

**Consciousness Precedes Form**: Consciousness evolves first on spiritual planes, then projects into material forms. Physical evolution follows and expresses prior spiritual development, inverting materialist causation.

**Descent from the Spiritual**: Humanity descends from spiritual beings who progressively densify into matter, reversing Darwin's ascent from simple material organisms. True human ancestry is spiritual, not material.

**Simultaneous Rather Than Sequential**: Different life forms manifest simultaneously on different planes rather than sequentially evolving from common ancestors through material processes alone.

### Ancient Evolutionary Knowledge

She claims Hindu Puranas and Buddhist cosmology preserved ancient knowledge of evolution millennia before Darwin, citing Puranic accounts of successive creations and transformations as anticipating evolutionary theory while maintaining spiritual framework Darwin's science rejected.

## Atlantis, Lemuria, and Lost Continents

Significant portions of Volume 2 discuss Lemuria and Atlantis as historical continents inhabited by Third and Fourth Root Races:

### Scientific Context

In the 1880s, some geologists and biologists proposed former land bridges or continents to explain biogeographical distribution patterns and fossil evidence. Philip Sclater suggested "Lemuria" as a hypothetical Indian Ocean continent to explain lemur distribution. Ignatius Donnelly's popular *Atlantis: The Antediluvian World* (1882) argued for historical Atlantis based on Plato's account.

Blavatsky appropriated these speculations, presenting Lemuria and Atlantis not as hypothetical geological phenomena but as historical certainties preserved in esoteric tradition and worldwide flood myths.

### Lemuria (Mu)

She describes Lemuria as vast continent spanning the Indian and Pacific Oceans, inhabited by the Third Root Race. The Lemurians gradually developed physical bodies and sexual differentiation. Their civilization was relatively primitive compared to later Atlantis, though they possessed psychic capacities modern humans lack. The continent was destroyed through volcanic activity and gradually sank, with survivors migrating to other lands and becoming ancestors of certain indigenous populations.

### Atlantis

Drawing on Plato's dialogues *Timaeus* and *Critias*, Blavatsky presents Atlantis as highly advanced civilization of the Fourth Root Race, located in the Atlantic Ocean. The Atlanteans developed sophisticated technology, mastered occult forces, and built a powerful empire. However, they became corrupted by materialism, practiced black magic, and misused their spiritual powers for selfish ends.

Divine retribution came through a series of catastrophic destructions over millennia. The final submergence occurred approximately 11,000 years ago, preserved in worldwide flood traditions including:
- Plato's Greek account
- Biblical flood narrative
- Hindu stories of Manu and the deluge
- Babylonian flood epics
- Native American deluge myths

She argues these universal flood traditions represent racial memory of Atlantis's destruction.

### Problematic Legacy

Contemporary geology has found no evidence supporting former continents in the Atlantic or Indian Oceans where Blavatsky placed them. Plate tectonics explains biogeographical patterns without requiring sunken continents. The Lemuria and Atlantis theories are considered pseudoscience.

Moreover, these narratives incorporated problematic racial hierarchies, with certain contemporary populations presented as "degenerate" remnants of earlier Root Races—claims that fed into scientific racism and were exploited by later racist ideologies, most infamously by Nazi occultists who appropriated Theosophical Aryan mythology.

## The Root Race Theory and Scientific Racism

The most controversial and problematic aspect of Volume 2 is the Root Race theory's incorporation of racial hierarchies:

### Nineteenth-Century Scientific Racism Context

Blavatsky wrote during the height of nineteenth-century scientific racism, when prominent scientists classified human "races" hierarchically, with Europeans presented as most evolved and other groups as inferior or primitive. Though she rejected crude biological racism and argued all humans possess the same spiritual potential, her system nonetheless incorporated evolutionary racial hierarchies.

### Problematic Elements

**Evolutionary Hierarchy**: Presenting human development through sequential racial stages implies some populations are more "advanced" or "evolved" than others, despite Blavatsky's insistence that all individuals can spiritually progress regardless of physical race.

**Contemporary Populations as Remnants**: She described certain indigenous populations as "degenerate remnants" of earlier Root Races, particularly characterizing some African and Australian Aboriginal peoples as survivors of Lemurian stock who failed to progress evolutionarily—deeply offensive characterizations reflecting colonial prejudices.

**Aryan Supremacy**: Naming the Fifth Root Race "Aryan" and placing European peoples among its most advanced sub-races reinforced racial supremacist ideologies, though Blavatsky used "Aryan" more linguistically (Indo-European) than the later Nazi biological interpretation.

**Physiognomic Speculation**: She engaged in problematic speculation about physical characteristics indicating evolutionary development, correlating skull shapes, brain sizes, and facial features with spiritual evolution in ways mirroring racist anthropology.

### Complicated Legacy

Scholars note several complicating factors:

**Anti-Racist Elements**: Blavatsky opposed slavery, colonialism's worst excesses, and crude biological racism. She argued all humans share common spiritual origin and potential, that individual spiritual development transcends physical race, and that wisdom traditions existed worldwide, not exclusively in Europe.

**Exploitation by Racists**: Later racist ideologies, particularly Nazi occultism, selectively appropriated Theosophical Aryan mythology while ignoring Blavatsky's universal brotherhood principles and her Jewish heritage. This appropriation distorted her intentions but drew on problematic elements her system contained.

**Historical Product**: The Root Race theory must be understood as product of Victorian scientific racism, Orientalist appropriation, and colonial power dynamics. Contemporary Theosophists generally reject or significantly reinterpret the racial aspects while maintaining other elements of the teaching.

**Critical Engagement Necessary**: Any serious engagement with Volume 2 requires critical examination of its racial theories, acknowledging both the historical context and the genuine harm these ideas caused, while recognizing the work's influence on other aspects of Western spirituality.

## Reception and Influence

### Contemporary Reception

Like Volume 1, *Anthropogenesis* received mixed reviews. Theosophists embraced it as revealed wisdom, while academic scholars criticized its questionable sources, speculative anthropology, and conflation of distinct mythological traditions. Scientists dismissed the Root Race theory and lost continent claims as unfounded speculation.

The volume proved particularly popular among readers interested in ancient mysteries, alternative history, and challenges to both biblical creationism and purely materialist evolution. It provided framework satisfying desires for:
- Synthesis of science and spirituality
- Ancient wisdom preserved through esoteric channels
- Meaning and purpose in evolution beyond random mechanism
- Connection to legendary lost civilizations
- Spiritual explanation for human diversity and development

### Influence on Alternative Anthropology

*Anthropogenesis* profoundly influenced alternative and esoteric approaches to human origins:

**Lost Civilization Theories**: The work established Atlantis and Lemuria as fixtures in alternative historical speculation, inspiring countless books, theories, and movements claiming ancient advanced civilizations possessed superior wisdom and technology.

**Ancient Astronaut Theories**: Later theorists appropriated the structure—advanced beings (reinterpreted as extraterrestrials) guiding human evolution—replacing Blavatsky's spiritual Masters with alien civilizations.

**Esoteric Anthropology**: Occult and esoteric schools including Anthroposophy, certain branches of Rosicrucianism, and various New Age movements adopted modified versions of Root Race evolution and lost continent narratives.

**Alternative History**: The work contributed to alternative historical approaches challenging academic consensus, arguing for suppressed ancient knowledge, cyclic rather than linear historical progress, and spiritual dimensions to human development.

### Influence on Western Understanding of Karma and Reincarnation

Beyond the problematic racial theories, Volume 2 significantly influenced Western reception of Hindu and Buddhist doctrines:

**Popularizing Reincarnation**: The work made reincarnation intellectually respectable among Western audiences, presenting it as rational alternative to both Christian resurrection doctrine and materialist annihilation at death.

**Karma as Cosmic Justice**: Blavatsky's presentation of karma as impersonal moral law—not divine judgment but natural cause and effect—appealed to Western rationalist sensibilities while providing ethical framework evolution seemed to lack.

**Spiritual Evolution Framework**: The synthesis of biological evolution with spiritual development through reincarnation created framework that contemporary spiritual movements, particularly New Age thought, continue to employ.

**Eastern Concepts in Western Language**: By translating karma, reincarnation, and cyclical cosmology into Victorian English and correlating them with Western philosophical and scientific concepts, she made these ideas accessible to audiences who might never read Hindu or Buddhist texts directly.

## Scholarly Assessment

### Academic Evaluation

Contemporary scholars approach Volume 2 with critical awareness of its problematic elements while recognizing its historical significance:

**Pseudoscience**: The Root Race theory, lost continent claims, and speculative evolutionary anthropology lack empirical foundation and are considered pseudoscientific.

**Problematic Racial Ideology**: The racial hierarchies require critical examination and unequivocal rejection, even while understanding their Victorian context.

**Syncretistic Mythology**: Rather than authentic ancient wisdom, the work represents creative synthesis combining Hindu Puranic mythology, Buddhist cosmology, Platonic Atlantis narrative, Victorian evolutionary theory, and esoteric speculation.

**Historical Influence**: Despite scholarly inadequacies, the work significantly influenced Western spirituality, alternative historical thinking, and popular reception of Asian religious concepts.

**Document of Cultural Exchange**: The work reveals dynamics of cross-cultural appropriation, Orientalist construction, and the complex transmission of religious ideas between colonizer and colonized during the late nineteenth century.

### Contribution to Religious Studies

From religious studies perspective, Volume 2 offers valuable insights into:

**Western Esotericism**: Understanding Theosophical anthropology and its influence on twentieth-century occultism and New Age movements.

**Cultural Appropriation Mechanisms**: Examining how Western esotericists extracted and reinterpreted concepts from Asian religious traditions.

**Popular Religious Innovation**: Analyzing how new religious movements synthesize diverse sources into novel systems appealing to contemporary spiritual seekers.

**Evolution and Religion**: Understanding religious responses to evolutionary theory and attempts to reconcile scientific and spiritual worldviews.

## This Digital Edition

Project Gutenberg, Internet Archive, and Theosophical University Press provide free access to *The Secret Doctrine, Volume 2: Anthropogenesis*, enabling contemporary readers to engage this historically influential and deeply controversial text. The work remains valuable for:

- **History of Western Esotericism**: Understanding Theosophical anthropology and its widespread influence
- **Religious Studies**: Examining Western appropriation and reinterpretation of Hindu and Buddhist concepts
- **Victorian Studies**: Analyzing nineteenth-century responses to evolutionary theory and racial science
- **Critical Race Studies**: Examining how esoteric systems incorporated and perpetuated racial hierarchies
- **Alternative History Studies**: Understanding the origins of lost civilization narratives and ancient wisdom claims
- **New Age Studies**: Tracing the genealogy of contemporary beliefs in spiritual evolution and reincarnation
- **Intellectual History**: Following the popularization of karma and reincarnation in Western thought

Contemporary readers must approach *Anthropogenesis* with critical awareness of its problematic racial theories and pseudoscientific speculation while recognizing its profound historical influence on Western spirituality and the transmission of Asian religious concepts to English-speaking audiences. The work's controversial legacy demonstrates both the possibilities and dangers of cross-cultural spiritual synthesis, the enduring impact of Victorian scientific racism, and the complex dynamics through which Hindu and Buddhist philosophy entered Western consciousness during the colonial era.
