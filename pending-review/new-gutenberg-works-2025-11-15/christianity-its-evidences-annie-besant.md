description: |
  Annie Besant's *Christianity: Its Evidences, Its Origin, Its Morality, Its History*, published in 1876, stands as one of her earliest and most comprehensive critiques of Christianity, written during her initial break from the Anglican faith that had defined her upbringing and early married life. This systematic analysis examines Christian claims to divine revelation, the historical foundations of biblical narratives, the ethical coherence of Christian moral teaching, and the institutional church's role in European history. Besant applies Higher Criticism—the scholarly method examining biblical texts as historical documents rather than divine revelation—alongside philosophical arguments against miracles, prophecy, and supernatural claims. She challenges the historical reliability of gospel accounts, questions the moral character of Old Testament deity portrayals, and critiques Christian ethics as inferior to secular humanist morality. The work demonstrates Besant's transition from devoted Christian to militant atheist, influenced by her reading of Charles Bradlaugh and her involvement with the National Secular Society. Her comprehensive approach—addressing evidential, historical, ethical, and institutional dimensions—made this a significant contribution to Victorian freethought literature. The text is particularly notable as the intellectual foundation for Besant's later activism on behalf of birth control, women's rights, and labor causes, all grounded in her rejection of religious authority in favor of reason and ethical autonomy.
