# Auld lang syne

## Overview

Published in 1898, two years before his death, *Auld lang syne* represents Friedrich Max Müller's reflective autobiographical account of his intellectual journey from provincial German childhood to international scholarly eminence. The Scottish title—"old long since" or "days gone by"—evokes the memoir's nostalgic tone as the seventy-five-year-old scholar revisited formative experiences, relationships, and decisions that shaped his remarkable career. Unlike conventional Victorian autobiography emphasizing public achievement and moral instruction, Müller's narrative focuses on intellectual development, scholarly mentorship, and the personal networks underlying nineteenth-century European academic culture.

The memoir traces Müller's education in German universities during the 1840s, when comparative philology and Sanskrit studies were emerging as distinct scholarly fields. He recounts studying under Hermann Brockhaus in Leipzig, who introduced him to Sanskrit; Eugene Burnouf in Paris, the era's greatest Orientalist; and his decision to undertake a critical edition of the Rig Veda, the oldest Sanskrit text and foundational document of Indo-European studies. The narrative follows his migration to England in 1846, his struggles to secure patronage for the Rig Veda project, his eventual appointment at Oxford, and his establishment as Victorian Britain's leading authority on Sanskrit, comparative philology, and Indian religions.

*Auld lang syne* provides invaluable historical evidence about the intellectual, institutional, and personal dimensions of nineteenth-century Orientalist scholarship—revealing both the genuine scholarly dedication and the complex patronage relationships, national rivalries, and cultural assumptions shaping Victorian academic life.

## Early Life and Education

### Dessau Childhood (1823-1841)

Friedrich Max Müller was born December 6, 1823, in Dessau, the capital of the small German duchy of Anhalt-Dessau. His father, Wilhelm Müller (1794-1827), achieved literary fame as a Romantic poet whose verse cycles inspired Schubert's song cycles *Die schöne Müllerin* and *Winterreise*. Wilhelm Müller's early death when Max was four years old profoundly affected the family's circumstances and the young Müller's consciousness, a loss he references repeatedly in the memoir.

Müller's mother, Adelheid Müller (née Basedow), descended from an intellectually distinguished family—her grandfather was the educational reformer Johann Bernhard Basedow. She provided Müller's early education and cultivated his intellectual interests despite limited financial resources following her husband's death. The ducal court of Dessau, though small, maintained high cultural standards, exposing Müller to music, literature, and classical education.

### University Studies (1841-1846)

Müller's memoir devotes considerable attention to his university education, emphasizing the mentors who shaped his scholarly direction:

**Leipzig (1841-1843)**: Initially studying classics and philology, Müller encountered Hermann Brockhaus, who had recently returned from extended residence in India and held one of Germany's first university positions in Sanskrit. Brockhaus introduced Müller to Sanskrit grammar and Vedic literature, awakening the passion that would define his career. Müller describes the revelation of discovering Sanskrit's systematic grammar and its relationship to Greek and Latin.

**Berlin (1843-1844)**: Müller studied under Friedrich Schelling (philosophy), Franz Bopp (comparative philology), and others, immersing himself in German idealist philosophy and the emerging science of comparative linguistics. He attended Schopenhauer's lectures on philosophy, forming a personal acquaintance with the pessimistic philosopher that appears repeatedly in the memoir.

**Paris (1844-1846)**: The memoir's most extensive educational section describes Müller's studies with Eugene Burnouf, the era's greatest Sanskrit scholar. Burnouf's combination of rigorous philological method, enthusiasm for Indian literature, and personal warmth profoundly influenced Müller. Under Burnouf's guidance, Müller examined Vedic manuscripts in the Bibliothèque nationale and conceived his plan to produce a critical edition of the Rig Veda based on systematic collation of manuscript variants.

## The Rig Veda Project and Migration to England

### Scholarly Motivation

Müller explains his decision to undertake the Rig Veda edition as combining scholarly necessity with romantic dedication. The Rig Veda—the oldest Indo-European text, crucial for understanding Sanskrit, comparative philology, and Indo-European religion—existed only in incomplete or unreliable editions. Producing a critical edition based on manuscript collation represented the foundational task for serious Vedic studies. Yet the project required access to manuscripts scattered across European and Indian collections, substantial financial support, and years of intensive labor without guarantee of academic position or compensation.

Burnouf encouraged the project but warned of practical difficulties. European universities offered few Sanskrit positions; the East India Company controlled access to Indian manuscripts; and scholarly publishing rarely generated income. Nevertheless, Müller committed to the work with youthful idealism the memoir describes both admiringly and self-deprecatingly from aged perspective.

### Baron von Bunsen's Patronage

Müller's migration to England in 1846 resulted from Baron Christian von Bunsen's patronage. Bunsen, Prussian ambassador to Britain and amateur Orientalist, recognized the Rig Veda project's importance and facilitated Müller's access to East India Company manuscripts held in London. The memoir portrays Bunsen as crucial mentor and patron, providing introductions to British scholarly and aristocratic circles, securing financial support, and offering personal encouragement during difficult years when Müller lacked secure position.

This patronage relationship illuminates nineteenth-century academic culture's dependence on individual patrons rather than institutional funding. Müller's career advancement depended less on formal qualifications than on personal connections, demonstrated scholarly ability, and patrons' willingness to advocate with authorities controlling resources and appointments.

### East India Company Support

The East India Company's Court of Directors authorized Müller's access to Sanskrit manuscripts in India House library and eventually funded the Rig Veda edition's publication. The memoir describes negotiations securing this support—Müller presented the project as serving British interests by advancing knowledge of Indian culture and demonstrating British scholarly leadership. The Company's support reflected both genuine intellectual patronage and imperial utility—understanding Vedic literature ostensibly aided colonial governance.

The Rig Veda edition appeared in six volumes between 1849 and 1874, establishing Müller's scholarly reputation. The memoir describes the sustained labor this required—collating manuscript variants, editing Sanskrit text, preparing indexes and annotations—work demanding both technical philological skill and extraordinary persistence.

## Oxford Career and Academic Politics

### Securing Oxford Position

Despite the Rig Veda project's prestige, Müller struggled for years to secure academic appointment. The memoir candidly discusses the difficulties facing a German scholar in mid-Victorian Oxford—xenophobia, suspicion of "foreign" scholarship, competition from British candidates, and Oxford's emphasis on classical languages rather than Oriental studies.

Müller initially lectured privately and served as deputy to the Taylorian Professor of Modern European Languages. His appointment as Professor of Modern Languages in 1854 provided financial security but didn't fully utilize his Sanskrit expertise. Not until 1868 was a Professorship of Comparative Philology created specifically for him, finally recognizing his scholarly contributions formally.

### Boden Professorship Controversy (1860)

The memoir addresses, albeit discretely, Müller's controversial failure to secure the Boden Professorship of Sanskrit in 1860 despite being the obvious scholarly choice. Conservative Oxford elements opposed Müller for being German, for his liberal religious views, and for suspicions that his comparative religious scholarship undermined Christian orthodoxy. Monier Monier-Williams, less distinguished as scholar but politically safer as Anglican clergyman, received the appointment.

Müller's treatment of this painful episode demonstrates Victorian reticence about personal grievances while revealing academic politics' role in scholarly careers. Contemporary readers recognize religious and national prejudices shaping the decision, though Müller presents it diplomatically.

## Intellectual Relationships and Networks

### European Scholarly Community

The memoir provides rich documentation of nineteenth-century European intellectual networks. Müller describes friendships and correspondence with:

**Felix Mendelssohn**: The composer, whom Müller knew in Leipzig during the 1840s. Their relationship exemplifies connections between scholarly and artistic circles in German cultural life.

**Arthur Schopenhauer**: The philosopher, whose pessimistic philosophy and interest in Indian thought created intellectual affinity despite temperamental differences.

**Alexander von Humboldt**: The naturalist-explorer, who encouraged Müller's scholarly work and facilitated introductions.

**Jacob Grimm**: The philologist and folklorist, whose comparative methods influenced Müller's linguistics.

**Thomas Carlyle**: The British historian and essayist, whose philosophical German idealism attracted Müller.

**Alfred Tennyson**: The Poet Laureate, with whom Müller developed friendship based on shared interest in comparative religion.

**Ralph Waldo Emerson**: The American transcendentalist, whose philosophical idealism and interest in Indian thought created trans-Atlantic intellectual connection.

These relationships reveal the dense personal networks connecting European and American intellectual elites—scholars, artists, writers, and thinkers who corresponded extensively, visited each other, and created informal international republic of letters transcending national boundaries.

### Religious Faith and Scholarly Work

Throughout the memoir, Müller addresses the relationship between his scholarly work on comparative religion and his Christian faith. He insists that studying non-Christian religions deepened rather than undermined his Christianity, as comparative analysis revealed universal religious consciousness expressed diversely across cultures. This apologetic dimension reflects Victorian anxieties about whether Orientalist scholarship threatened Christian orthodoxy—a charge Müller repeatedly faced from conservative critics.

His position exemplified liberal Protestant theology accommodating scientific and historical scholarship while maintaining religious faith. Müller argued that truth couldn't contradict truth—genuine scientific findings must harmonize with genuine religious insight, requiring reinterpretation of traditional doctrines but not abandonment of faith.

## Literary and Personal Dimensions

### Autobiographical Style

Müller's narrative adopts intimate, conversational tone, addressing readers directly and reflecting personally on youthful ambitions, mistakes, and lessons learned. Unlike many Victorian memoirs emphasizing public achievement and moral exemplarity, *Auld lang syne* focuses on intellectual formation, scholarly relationships, and cultural contexts rather than external success.

The Scottish title suggests the work's nostalgic mood—an elderly scholar revisiting "old long since" with both affection and critical distance. Müller frequently contrasts youthful idealism with aged perspective, noting how ambitions, anxieties, and conflicts that seemed momentous at the time appear differently from decades' distance.

### Family and Personal Life

While primarily intellectual autobiography, the memoir includes personal dimensions—his marriage to Georgina Grenfell (daughter of a distinguished British family), family life at Oxford, relationships with children, and domestic happiness tempering scholarly labors. These elements humanize the portrait beyond purely professional narrative.

Müller's references to personal loss—his father's early death, Burnouf's premature death from cholera, the deaths of friends and mentors—provide emotional depth. The memoir's autumnal tone reflects an aging man surveying life with awareness that his own "auld lang syne" approaches conclusion.

## Historical Significance

### Victorian Academic Culture

*Auld lang syne* provides invaluable evidence about nineteenth-century academic institutions, career structures, and intellectual practices:

- **Patronage Systems**: How scholarly careers depended on individual patrons rather than formalized institutional structures
- **International Networks**: The cosmopolitan character of European intellectual life, with scholars moving between universities and maintaining extensive correspondence
- **Academic Politics**: Religious tests, national prejudices, and institutional conservatism shaping appointments and careers
- **Publishing Practices**: How major scholarly projects secured funding and publication
- **Disciplinary Formation**: The emergence of Sanskrit studies, comparative philology, and religious studies as academic disciplines

### Orientalism and Empire

The memoir illuminates British Orientalism's institutional and personal dimensions. Müller's scholarly career depended upon imperial power structures—East India Company support, access to colonial manuscripts, British interest in governing India. Yet his personal narrative emphasizes intellectual rather than political motivations, reflecting how Victorian scholars often constructed their work as purely scholarly despite its embededness in colonial systems.

Postcolonial scholarship recognizes both Müller's genuine intellectual dedication and the colonial context enabling his access to Indian materials while excluding most Indian scholars from equivalent resources and recognition.

### Religious Studies History

As founder of the "science of religion" (comparative religious studies), Müller's autobiographical account provides primary source material for understanding how this discipline emerged. His negotiations between scholarly objectivity and personal faith, his arguments for studying non-Christian religions seriously, and his liberal Protestant theological framework all appear in the memoir, documenting the intellectual and personal dimensions of comparative religion's founding.

## This Digital Edition

Project Gutenberg and Internet Archive provide free access to *Auld lang syne*, enabling contemporary readers to engage Müller's autobiographical reflections. The work remains valuable for:

- **Victorian Studies**: Understanding nineteenth-century academic culture and intellectual life
- **History of Orientalism**: Examining how Sanskrit studies and Indology developed institutionally
- **Biography**: Personal insights into a major Victorian intellectual figure
- **Religious Studies History**: Tracing comparative religion's emergence as scholarly discipline
- **Intellectual History**: Documenting European scholarly networks and knowledge production

While readers must approach the text critically, recognizing its Victorian cultural assumptions and colonial context, the memoir endures as rich historical source revealing both individual biography and broader institutional and intellectual transformations shaping modern academic disciplines studying Asian languages, religions, and cultures.
