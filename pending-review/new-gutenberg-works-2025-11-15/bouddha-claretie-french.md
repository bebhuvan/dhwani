# Bouddha

## Description

A French-language biographical work on Buddha by Jules Claretie, *Bouddha* presents a nineteenth-century European interpretation of the Buddha's life and teachings. Published in 1869, this work reflects French intellectual engagement with Buddhism during a period of increasing Western scholarly interest in Asian religions and philosophies. Claretie approaches the Buddha through biographical narrative, presenting the historical and legendary accounts that shaped Western understanding of the Buddha during the Victorian era. The work demonstrates French cultural fascination with Oriental subjects and represents a specific moment in European intellectual history regarding Buddhism's reception. As a French-language work, it reflects European rather than authentic Buddhist scholarship or Indian textual tradition. The biography synthesizes available sources within nineteenth-century European knowledge frameworks, presenting Buddha's life and teachings through Western interpretive lenses. *Bouddha* remains historically significant as evidence of European intellectual engagement with Buddhism and represents the particular approaches European writers employed in accessing and interpreting Asian religious traditions during the nineteenth century.
