  *Buddhist Psalms*, published in 1914, presents English translation of devotional poems (*wasan*) by Shinran Shonin (1173-1263), founder of Jōdo Shinshū (True Pure Land Buddhism), offering Western audiences introduction to devotional Buddhist literature expressing faith in Amida Buddha's compassionate vow to save all beings who entrust themselves to his infinite merit. Translated by S. Yamabe and L. Adams Beck as part of the "Wisdom of the East" series, the collection comprises lyrical verses expressing core Pure Land teachings—radical dependence on Amida Buddha's "Other Power" (*tariki*) rather than "self-power" (*jiriki*) meditation or ethical cultivation, salvation through faith (*shinjin*) and recitation of nembutsu (Namu Amida Butsu—"I take refuge in Amida Buddha"), rebirth in Pure Land where enlightenment becomes accessible to ordinary people unable to achieve liberation through monastic discipline alone, and universal compassion extending to even the most wicked who recognize their spiritual helplessness. The psalms reflect Indian Mahayana Buddhist developments—particularly the Larger and Smaller Pure Land Sutras describing Amida's vows and his Western Paradise, Nagarjuna's concept of "easy path" versus "difficult path" to enlightenment, and the bodhisattva ideal of compassionate assistance—as filtered through Chinese Pure Land traditions (Tanluan, Shandao) and Shinran's radical Japanese reformation emphasizing absolute grace over gradual cultivation. This devotional poetry influenced Japanese spiritual life, providing accessible Buddhist path for laypeople, and introduced Western readers to Buddhist devotionalism's emotional depth, challenging stereotypes of Buddhism as purely philosophical or meditation-focused tradition.

# Buddhist Psalms

## Overview

Published in 1914 as part of the "Wisdom of the East" series, *Buddhist Psalms* presents English translation of devotional poems (*wasan*) composed by Shinran Shonin (1173-1263), founder of Jōdo Shinshū (True Pure Land Buddhism), one of Japan's largest Buddhist denominations. The collection introduced Western audiences to Buddhist devotional literature's lyrical and emotional dimensions, challenging prevailing Western stereotypes of Buddhism as purely philosophical system or meditation discipline lacking devotional fervor comparable to Christian or Hindu bhakti traditions.

The psalms express core Pure Land Buddhist teachings centered on Amida Buddha (Amitabha in Sanskrit)—cosmic Buddha who, according to Mahayana sutras, made forty-eight vows to create Pure Land (Western Paradise, Sukhavati) where beings could easily attain enlightenment, most importantly vowing to save all who call upon him with sincere faith. Pure Land Buddhism offers "easy path" accessible to ordinary laypeople who cannot achieve liberation through monastic meditation or ethical perfection alone—emphasizing faith (*shinjin*), recitation of Amida's name (nembutsu: Namu Amida Butsu), and reliance on "Other Power" (*tariki*—Amida's compassionate merit) rather than "self-power" (*jiriki*—one's own meditation, ethical cultivation, or wisdom).

Shinran radicalized Pure Land teaching by arguing that even single sincere nembutsu suffices for salvation, that faith itself is Amida's gift rather than human achievement, and that Amida's compassion extends especially to evil persons who recognize their spiritual helplessness—positions considered heretical by some Buddhist schools but enormously influential in Japanese religious history. His *wasan* (Japanese devotional verses) express these teachings through accessible poetry suitable for chanting, memorization, and devotional contemplation by ordinary believers.

The work traces lineage to Indian Mahayana Buddhist developments—Pure Land sutras describing Amida's vows, Nagarjuna's distinction between difficult and easy paths, bodhisattva compassion ideals—through Chinese Pure Land patriarchs (Tanluan, Daochuo, Shandao, Genshin) to Japanese reformation by Hōnen (Shinran's teacher) and Shinran's further radicalization. The psalms exemplify how Buddhism adapted across cultures while maintaining connections to Indian philosophical foundations—demonstrating Buddhism's diversity beyond meditation-focused Zen or philosophical Madhyamaka schools.

For Western readers in 1914 (and contemporary readers), *Buddhist Psalms* illuminates Buddhist devotionalism, introduces Pure Land teachings emphasizing grace over works, reveals emotional and poetic dimensions of Buddhist spirituality, and demonstrates Buddhism's successful adaptation to lay practitioners' needs across Asian cultures.

## The Author: Shinran Shonin

### Life and Historical Context

Shinran Shonin (1173-1263) lived during tumultuous Kamakura period (1185-1333) when samurai rule replaced aristocratic court culture, social upheaval devastated Japan, and new Buddhist movements emerged addressing ordinary people's spiritual needs.

**Early Life**: Born to aristocratic family, Shinran entered Buddhist monastic training at age nine on Mount Hiei, headquarters of Tendai school—then Japan's dominant Buddhist tradition combining meditation, esoteric ritual, and comprehensive Buddhist study.

**Mount Hiei Training**: For twenty years, Shinran pursued traditional monastic path—extensive scriptural study, meditation practice, esoteric initiations, ethical discipline. Despite intensive effort, he failed to achieve enlightenment or even confidence in spiritual progress, experiencing what he later described as profound despair over his incapacity for self-powered liberation.

**Crisis and Conversion**: At age twenty-nine, despairing of monastic methods' efficacy, Shinran sought guidance from Hōnen (1133-1212), founder of Jōdo-shū (Pure Land school), who taught radical reliance on Amida Buddha's compassion through nembutsu practice rather than meditation or ethical cultivation. Shinran converted to Hōnen's teaching, abandoning Mount Hiei for Pure Land path.

**Persecution**: Pure Land teaching's popularity threatened established Buddhist schools and aristocratic interests. In 1207, government persecuted Hōnen's movement—Hōnen and Shinran were exiled, disciples executed. Shinran was forcibly defrocked (stripped of monastic status) and exiled to rural Echigo province.

**Married Life**: During exile, Shinran married Eshinni (revolutionary for Buddhist teacher, since monks observed celibacy). This experience shaped his teaching that enlightenment wasn't restricted to celibate monastics but accessible to married laypeople living ordinary lives.

**Teaching Career**: After exile ended, Shinran never returned to monastic life but lived as married teacher in eastern Japan, developing distinctive Pure Land theology and gathering followers. His major work, *Kyōgyōshinshō* (Teaching, Practice, Faith, and Enlightenment), systematically expounded his theology.

**Wasan Composition**: Shinran composed numerous *wasan* (Japanese devotional verses in 7-5 syllable meter)—including *Shōshinge* (Hymn of True Faith), *Jōdo Wasan* (Hymns of the Pure Land), *Kōsō Wasan* (Hymns of the Patriarchs), and *Sanjo Wasan* (Hymns of the Three Periods). These became central to Jōdo Shinshū liturgy, chanted in temples and homes.

### Shinran's Radical Theology

Shinran's teaching diverged significantly from traditional Buddhism and even from his teacher Hōnen:

**Absolute Other-Power**: While Hōnen emphasized Amida's compassion, Shinran radicalized this to absolute dependence—even faith itself is Amida's gift, not human achievement. Humans contribute nothing to salvation; Amida accomplishes everything.

**Evil Persons as Primary Object**: Shinran taught that Amida's compassion aims especially at evil persons (*akunin*)—those who recognize their spiritual helplessness. "Good persons" who think ethical cultivation suffices may miss the point; "evil persons" who despair of self-power become ideal recipients of grace.

**Single Nembutsu Sufficiency**: One sincere nembutsu assured rebirth in Pure Land—repeated recitation expresses gratitude, not attempts to accumulate merit or ensure salvation.

**Already Saved**: True faith means recognizing one is already embraced by Amida's compassion—salvation isn't future reward earned through practice but present reality recognized through faith.

**Rejection of Calculation**: Attempting to earn merit through nembutsu, ethical behavior, or ritual practice misunderstands Amida's unconditional compassion. True faith involves abandoning calculation and self-power, entrusting completely to Other-Power.

These teachings scandalized traditional Buddhism while profoundly influencing Japanese religious culture.

## Indian Buddhist Foundations of Pure Land

### The Pure Land Sutras

Pure Land Buddhism bases itself on Mahayana sutras composed in India (though some scholars suggest Central Asian origin):

**Larger Sukhavativyuha Sutra** (Larger Pure Land Sutra): Describes how Dharmakara Bodhisattva made forty-eight vows to create ideal realm for spiritual practice, most importantly:
- 18th Vow: If beings desire rebirth in my Pure Land and call my name with sincere faith (even ten times), they will be born there (exceptions only for those committing gravest offenses and slandering Dharma)
- Other vows: Pure Land inhabitants won't fall into lower realms, will have perfect bodies free from suffering, will remember past lives, will attain enlightenment

After countless eons perfecting these vows, Dharmakara became Amida (Amitabha—Infinite Light; Amitayus—Infinite Life) Buddha, and his Pure Land (Sukhavati—Land of Bliss) became reality.

**Smaller Sukhavativyuha Sutra** (Smaller Pure Land Sutra): Describes Pure Land's splendors—jeweled trees, lotus ponds, celestial music, absence of suffering—and emphasizes that beings born there quickly attain enlightenment due to ideal conditions.

**Amitayurdhyana Sutra** (Meditation Sutra): Teaches visualization practices for contemplating Amida and Pure Land, describes nine grades of rebirth based on practice level.

### Nagarjuna and the Easy Path

The great Mahayana philosopher Nagarjuna (c. 2nd-3rd century CE), founder of Madhyamaka (Middle Way) philosophy, distinguished:

**Difficult Path** (*nan-gyo-do*): Achieving enlightenment through self-power—meditation, wisdom cultivation, ethical perfection, bodhisattva practices over countless lifetimes. Analogized to traveling by foot—slow, arduous, requiring great strength.

**Easy Path** (*i-gyo-do*): Achieving enlightenment through Other-Power—relying on Buddha's compassion, particularly Amida's vows. Analogized to traveling by boat—swift, accessible even to weak persons who couldn't walk long distances.

This distinction provided theoretical justification for Pure Land Buddhism as legitimate Mahayana path, particularly suited for degenerate age (*mappo*) when self-powered enlightenment became virtually impossible.

### Mahayana Philosophical Context

Pure Land teaching reflects broader Mahayana developments:

**Bodhisattva Ideal**: Unlike earlier Buddhism's emphasis on individual liberation (arhat ideal), Mahayana emphasizes bodhisattva—enlightened being who delays final nirvana to save all suffering beings. Amida exemplifies ultimate bodhisattva compassion.

**Skillful Means** (*upaya*): Mahayana teaching that enlightened beings adapt methods to beings' capacities—no single fixed path. Pure Land represents skillful means for those unable to follow monastic meditation path.

**Multiple Buddha Realms**: Mahayana cosmology describes countless Buddha-fields throughout universe, each created by Buddha's vows. Amida's Pure Land is one such field.

**Faith and Devotion**: While earlier Buddhism emphasized meditation and wisdom, Mahayana developed devotional elements—faith in Buddha's compassion, bodhisattva invocation, transfer of merit. Pure Land intensified this devotional dimension.

## Chinese Pure Land Development

### The Chinese Patriarchs

Pure Land Buddhism flourished in China, where masters developed theology transmitted to Japan:

**Tanluan** (476-542): Systematized Pure Land teaching, emphasizing Other-Power and Amida's vow as foundation. Distinguished self-power and Other-Power paths, arguing that in degenerate age, Other-Power alone suffices.

**Daochuo** (562-645): Further developed degenerate age (*mappo*) theory—arguing that Buddha's teaching progressively loses efficacy after his passing, making self-powered enlightenment virtually impossible in current era. Therefore, Pure Land path becomes essential.

**Shandao** (613-681): Most influential Chinese Pure Land master, emphasized nembutsu practice and Amida's universal compassion. Taught that even one sincere calling of Amida's name ensures rebirth—inspiring Hōnen and Shinran's radical simplification.

**Genshin** (942-1017): Japanese Tendai monk whose *Ōjōyōshū* (Essentials of Salvation) popularized Pure Land teaching in Japan through vivid descriptions of hell's horrors and Pure Land's bliss, motivating faith and nembutsu practice.

### Chinese Context

Pure Land Buddhism appealed broadly in China:

**Accessibility**: Required no monastic training, extensive scriptural study, or meditation mastery—suitable for laypeople, women, illiterate peasants, busy merchants.

**Integration**: Combined easily with other Buddhist practices and Confucian ethics—Pure Land devotion didn't require abandoning family duties or social responsibilities.

**Crisis Appeal**: During periods of warfare, social chaos, and suffering, Pure Land message of Amida's compassionate refuge offered hope and consolation.

## The Psalms: Themes and Content

### Amida's Compassionate Vows

Central theme is Amida's infinite compassion manifested through vows to save all beings:

The psalms celebrate Amida's Light—infinite, unconditional, reaching everywhere:
- Illuminating all worlds without exception
- Dispelling ignorance and suffering
- Grasping beings who would otherwise be lost
- Never abandoning even the most wicked

They emphasize Amida's Life—eternal, imperishable:
- Transcending birth and death
- Providing eternal refuge
- Embracing beings across infinite time

The vows are presented as already accomplished—not future promises but present reality:
- Pure Land exists now
- Amida's compassion operates now
- Rebirth is assured now through faith

### Faith as Gift and Response

The psalms express Pure Land teaching's paradoxical faith:

**Faith as Amida's Gift**: Sincere faith (*shinjin*) isn't human achievement but Amida's gift—when beings recognize their helplessness and entrust to Amida, this recognition itself comes from Amida's working.

**Faith as Response**: Simultaneously, faith involves human response—hearing Amida's call, recognizing one's spiritual poverty, abandoning self-power, entrusting to Other-Power.

**Already Embraced**: True faith means recognizing one is already grasped by Amida's Light—salvation isn't earned through practice but recognized through awakened awareness.

The psalms express joy and gratitude arising from this recognition:
- Wonder at unconditional compassion
- Gratitude for unmerited grace
- Confidence in assured rebirth
- Freedom from anxiety about spiritual progress

### Nembutsu: The Sacred Name

Nembutsu (Namu Amida Butsu—"I take refuge in Amida Buddha") features centrally:

**Not Mantra**: Unlike esoteric Buddhist mantras used for magical efficacy, nembutsu expresses faith and gratitude—calling Amida's name in recognition of his compassion.

**Not Merit-Making**: Unlike practices aimed at accumulating merit, nembutsu doesn't earn salvation (which Amida already accomplished) but expresses thankfulness.

**Spontaneous Expression**: True nembutsu arises naturally from grateful faith—not calculated repetition but spontaneous response to Amida's gift.

The psalms describe nembutsu's effects:
- Purifying karma
- Dispelling evil
- Bringing peace
- Connecting practitioner to Amida's Light
- Ensuring rebirth in Pure Land

### Pure Land: The Western Paradise

The psalms describe Pure Land's splendors drawing on sutra imagery:

**Physical Beauty**:
- Jeweled trees and lotus ponds
- Celestial music and fragrances
- Perfect climate without extremes
- Abundant resources without need

**Spiritual Advantages**:
- Absence of suffering and evil
- Presence of enlightened beings
- Teaching directly from Amida
- Swift progress toward enlightenment
- No backsliding or falling into lower realms

**Ultimate Purpose**: Pure Land isn't final destination but ideal training ground—once reborn there, beings quickly attain full enlightenment, then return to suffering worlds as bodhisattvas to save others.

### Evil Persons and Amida's Compassion

Distinctive Shinran theme emphasized in psalms:

**Akunin Shōki**: "Evil persons are Amida's primary concern"—those who recognize their wickedness and spiritual helplessness are ideally positioned to receive grace, whereas "good persons" who trust self-cultivation may miss the point.

**Spiritual Humility**: True faith requires recognizing one's utter incapacity for self-powered enlightenment—pride in ethical achievement or spiritual progress obstructs grace.

**Universal Scope**: Amida's compassion excludes no one—murderers, thieves, liars, those who break precepts—all are embraced if they entrust to Amida.

**Consolation**: This teaching offered profound consolation to those who felt excluded from traditional Buddhism's demanding monastic path or who despaired of ever achieving ethical or meditative mastery.

### Gratitude and Joy

The psalms' emotional tone is gratitude and joy:

**Wonder**: Amazement at receiving unmerited salvation—"How could such compassion exist?"

**Relief**: Liberation from anxiety about spiritual progress, merit accumulation, or earning salvation through practice.

**Devotion**: Love and loyalty toward Amida who provides refuge.

**Missionary Impulse**: Desire to share good news—telling others about Amida's compassion.

This emotional expressiveness challenged stereotypes of Buddhism as austere, emotionally cool philosophy.

## Literary and Devotional Dimensions

### Wasan Form

*Wasan* (Japanese devotional verses) possess specific characteristics:

**Meter**: 7-5 syllable pattern (shichigochō)—seven syllables, five syllables, alternating—creating rhythmic flow suitable for chanting.

**Accessibility**: Written in Japanese rather than classical Chinese—accessible to common people, women, those without scholarly training.

**Memorability**: Regular meter and simple language facilitate memorization—verses internalized through repeated chanting.

**Musical Quality**: Designed for musical chanting (*goeika*)—melodic delivery enhances devotional impact.

**Liturgical Use**: Incorporated into temple services, home altars, life-cycle ceremonies—functioning as communal and private devotion.

### Psalmic Comparison

The 1914 English translation titled collection "Buddhist Psalms," inviting comparison with biblical Psalms:

**Common Features**:
- Devotional poetry expressing faith
- Praising divine attributes (God's mercy vs. Amida's compassion)
- Seeking refuge and protection
- Gratitude for salvation
- Communal and liturgical use
- Emotional expressiveness

**Differences**:
- Psalms address personal God; wasan celebrate cosmic Buddha
- Psalms often petition for help; wasan express gratitude for already-accomplished salvation
- Psalms include lament and complaint; wasan predominantly joyful
- Psalms emphasize covenant relationship; wasan emphasize unconditional compassion

The comparison helped Western readers understand Buddhist devotional literature through familiar Christian framework while recognizing distinctive Buddhist elements.

## Historical and Cultural Impact

### Jōdo Shinshū Development

Shinran's teaching became one of Japan's largest Buddhist denominations:

**Institutional Growth**: Shinran's descendants and disciples established Honganji temples and institutional structure, eventually splitting into Nishi (West) and Higashi (East) Honganji branches.

**Popular Appeal**: Emphasis on lay practice, married priesthood, and accessibility attracted enormous followings—particularly among farmers, merchants, and lower samurai.

**Political Involvement**: Jōdo Shinshū communities sometimes engaged politically—*ikko-ikki* (single-minded uprisings) challenged warlord authority during medieval period.

**Educational Contributions**: Jōdo Shinshū institutions established schools, published texts, and promoted literacy.

**Contemporary Presence**: Jōdo Shinshū remains major Japanese Buddhist denomination with international presence, particularly among Japanese diaspora.

### Influence on Japanese Culture

Pure Land Buddhism profoundly shaped Japanese religiosity:

**Household Practice**: Home altars (*butsudan*) and daily nembutsu practice became common in Pure Land households.

**Funerary Buddhism**: Pure Land teachings shaped death rituals and attitudes toward afterlife—deceased were thought to attain rebirth in Pure Land.

**Aesthetic Influence**: Images of Amida, Pure Land mandala paintings, and devotional art enriched Japanese visual culture.

**Literary Influence**: *Wasan* influenced Japanese poetry and devotional literature.

**Ethical Framework**: While Shinran emphasized faith over works, Jōdo Shinshū developed ethical teachings about grateful living as response to Amida's gift.

## Western Reception and Comparative Theology

### Early Western Encounter

*Buddhist Psalms* (1914) contributed to Western understanding during early Buddhist studies period:

**Wisdom of the East Series**: Published by John Murray as part of series introducing Asian spiritual texts to Western audiences—other volumes included Confucian classics, Sufi poetry, Hindu scriptures.

**Comparative Interest**: Western scholars and spiritual seekers increasingly interested in comparing world religions, finding common ground while recognizing differences.

**Protestant Parallels**: Protestant Christians (particularly those emphasizing grace and faith) noted similarities between Pure Land Buddhism and Protestant Christianity:
- Salvation through grace not works
- Faith as primary religious response
- Assurance of salvation
- Accessible to ordinary people
- Devotional rather than ascetic emphasis

**Catholic Analogies**: Catholic missionaries in Japan had earlier noted Pure Land similarities to Catholic devotionalism—veneration of saints, prayers for intercession, rosary-like nembutsu beads.

### Theological Dialogues

Comparative theologians explored Pure Land-Christian similarities and differences:

**Grace**: Both emphasize unmerited divine compassion as salvation's source, but Amida is cosmic Buddha rather than personal Creator God.

**Faith**: Both emphasize faith's centrality, but Pure Land faith involves entrusting to Amida's vows rather than belief in historical revelation.

**Works**: Both critique salvation through ethical achievement alone, but Shinran goes further in absolute Other-Power emphasis.

**Afterlife**: Both describe salvific afterlife realm (Pure Land/Heaven), but Pure Land is training ground for enlightenment rather than eternal final state.

**Incarnation**: Christianity emphasizes God's unique incarnation in Jesus; Pure Land emphasizes Buddha's compassionate manifestation through vows but not historical incarnation.

These comparisons enriched both Buddhist and Christian theological understanding while highlighting distinctive features of each tradition.

## Contemporary Significance

### Buddhist Diversity

*Buddhist Psalms* demonstrates Buddhism's internal diversity:

**Beyond Meditation**: Challenges Western stereotype of Buddhism as purely meditation tradition—showing devotional, faith-based expressions.

**Beyond Philosophy**: Reveals emotional, poetic, and liturgical dimensions beyond abstract philosophy.

**Accessible Path**: Illustrates how Buddhism adapted to lay practitioners' needs—not requiring monastic renunciation or meditation mastery.

**Cultural Adaptation**: Shows how Buddhism transformed across cultures (India to China to Japan) while maintaining core teachings about suffering's cessation.

### Spiritual and Ethical Insights

The work offers resources for contemporary spirituality:

**Grace and Acceptance**: Teaching about unconditional compassion and acceptance despite imperfection resonates with those struggling with perfectionism or spiritual inadequacy.

**Faith and Trust**: Emphasis on entrusting to greater power (whether conceived as Buddha, God, or Life itself) addresses control anxiety and self-reliance's limits.

**Gratitude Practice**: Nembutsu as grateful response rather than merit-making provides model for non-instrumental spiritual practice.

**Humility**: Recognition of spiritual poverty and helplessness can paradoxically liberate from ego-driven striving.

**Compassion**: Amida's universal compassion including "evil persons" challenges exclusionary religious attitudes.
