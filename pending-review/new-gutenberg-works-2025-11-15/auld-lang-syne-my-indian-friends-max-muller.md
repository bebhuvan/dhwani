# Auld lang syne: Second Series - My Indian friends

## Overview

Published in 1899, just one year before Max Müller's death, *Auld lang syne: Second Series - My Indian friends* represents the aging scholar's tribute to the Indian pandits, scholars, and intellectual collaborators whose expertise made his life's work possible. Unlike typical Victorian memoirs focusing exclusively on European intellectual circles, Müller devoted this volume to Indian scholars who served as teachers, collaborators, and friends throughout his five-decade career in Sanskrit studies. The work documents Pandit Ishwar Chandra's patient instruction in Sanskrit grammar, Pandit Rama Mishra's assistance with Rig Vedic interpretation, Baboo Rajendralal Mitra's archaeological and epigraphic scholarship, and numerous other Indian intellectuals whose contributions often went unacknowledged in official scholarly publications.

The memoir appeared during the twilight of Victorian Orientalism, as nationalist movements in India increasingly questioned European monopolization of knowledge about Indian traditions. Müller's appreciative portraits of his Indian collaborators challenged crude colonial hierarchies that dismissed Indian scholarship, yet the work also reveals the inherent asymmetries in colonial knowledge production—European scholars gained professional prestige and financial security through work dependent upon Indian expertise, while their collaborators typically received modest compensation and limited recognition.

*Auld lang syne: Second Series* provides unique historical evidence about the social relations underlying nineteenth-century Orientalist scholarship, the persistence of indigenous Sanskrit learning despite colonial education policies favoring English, and the complex negotiations through which Indian scholars both served and resisted colonial knowledge systems.

## Historical Context: Sanskrit Scholarship in Colonial India

### Indigenous Sanskrit Traditions

When Max Müller began Sanskrit studies in the 1840s, indigenous Sanskrit learning in India survived primarily through traditional pathol (schools) maintained by Brahmin communities. These institutions transmitted Vedic recitation, grammatical analysis using Panini's sophisticated system, philosophical texts, ritual knowledge, and literary traditions through guru-shishya (teacher-student) lineages spanning centuries. Colonial education policies promoting English-medium instruction and Western curricula threatened these traditional learning systems, yet many pandits continued preserving Sanskrit knowledge.

British Orientalists like Müller depended absolutely on these indigenous scholars. European students learned Sanskrit from Indian pandits, consulted them about textual interpretation, employed them to copy manuscripts, and relied upon their expertise to navigate complex textual traditions. This created a paradoxical relationship—colonial scholarship simultaneously valued and subordinated Indian knowledge.

### Colonial Knowledge Production

The British East India Company and later the Raj sponsored Sanskrit scholarship for multiple reasons: Orientalist administrators like Warren Hastings believed understanding Indian traditions would facilitate governance; scholars sought prestige through Oriental studies; and philologists pursued comparative linguistics by studying Sanskrit's relationship to European languages. This produced institutions like Fort William College in Calcutta (1800), Hindu College (1817), and later Sanskrit College (1824), which created employment opportunities for Indian scholars while channeling indigenous knowledge into colonial frameworks.

European Orientalists gained academic positions, scholarly reputations, and financial rewards through work dependent on Indian collaborators who typically received only modest salaries or honoraria. Müller's Rig Veda edition, for instance, brought him international scholarly renown and Oxford professorship, while the pandits who provided manuscripts, explained grammar, and clarified meanings remained largely anonymous in official credits.

### Max Müller's Career and Indian Connections

Friedrich Max Müller (1823-1900) never visited India, conducting his entire Sanskrit career from European libraries and universities. He learned Sanskrit initially from German scholars but relied heavily on Indian pandits in Britain and correspondence with scholars in India for advanced textual work. His monumental six-volume critical edition of the Rig Veda (1849-1874), the foundation of his scholarly reputation, required extensive consultation with Indian experts about textual variants, Vedic interpretation, and ritual contexts.

Throughout his career, Müller employed several Indian pandits in Oxford, corresponded extensively with Indian scholars, and cultivated relationships with Indian students and intellectuals visiting Britain. These connections proved indispensable for his editorial projects, including the *Sacred Books of the East* series and various translations and studies of Vedic and Upanishadic literature.

## Contents and Principal Figures

### Pandit Ishwar Chandra

Müller's account of Pandit Ishwar Chandra provides intimate details about their collaborative relationship. Ishwar Chandra served as Müller's Sanskrit teacher and advisor on the Rig Veda project, residing in Oxford for several years. Müller describes the pandit's mastery of Paninian grammar, his expertise in Vedic interpretation, and his patient instruction helping Müller navigate Sanskrit's complexities.

The relationship transcended mere employment—Müller presents Ishwar Chandra as intellectual mentor and friend, describing their daily study sessions, discussions of grammatical niceties, and the pandit's homesickness for India while serving Müller's scholarly ambitions in England. Yet the account also reveals the power imbalance: Ishwar Chandra depended upon Müller's patronage, lived far from home to serve British scholarship, and enabled work that advanced Müller's career while receiving limited recognition himself.

### Pandit Rama Mishra

Rama Mishra collaborated with Müller on interpreting difficult Vedic passages, providing traditional commentarial perspectives that European philology alone couldn't supply. Müller's reminiscence emphasizes Rama Mishra's deep knowledge of Vedic ritual, his familiarity with multiple Sanskrit commentaries, and his ability to explain obscure references through traditional learning.

The account documents how Müller's Sanskrit scholarship depended upon synthesizing European philological methods (comparative linguistics, manuscript criticism, historical analysis) with indigenous interpretive traditions (commentarial literature, ritual knowledge, grammatical expertise). This collaboration produced more sophisticated Vedic scholarship than either European or Indian approaches alone could achieve, yet credit predominantly accrued to European scholars publishing under their own names.

### Baboo Rajendralal Mitra (1822-1891)

Rajendralal Mitra represents a different category of Indian scholar—a Bengali intellectual who combined traditional Sanskrit learning with Western scientific methods. Mitra studied at Hare School and Hindu College in Calcutta, gaining expertise in Sanskrit, archaeology, epigraphy, and natural history. He became one of colonial India's most prominent scholars, publishing extensively on Sanskrit literature, Buddhist archaeology, and Indo-Aryan antiquities.

Müller's treatment of Mitra emphasizes their intellectual exchange as scholarly equals rather than patron-client relationship. Mitra served as Honorary Secretary of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, edited Sanskrit texts, conducted archaeological surveys, and published works cited by European scholars. He corresponded with Müller about textual problems, archaeological discoveries, and scholarly debates.

Mitra exemplified the emerging class of Indian intellectuals who mastered both Sanskrit traditional learning and European scholarly methods, contributing original research to international Oriental studies while remaining in India. His career trajectory differed from pandits like Ishwar Chandra who primarily served European scholars—Mitra established independent scholarly authority recognized internationally.

### Other Indian Collaborators

Müller's memoir includes shorter accounts of additional Indian scholars:

**Pandit Kasinath**: Assisted with manuscript collation and textual criticism for the Rig Veda edition.

**Pandit Gopal Shashtri**: Provided expertise on Vedic ritual and commentarial traditions.

**Pandit Ramakrishna Bhandarkar**: Distinguished Orientalist scholar with whom Müller exchanged scholarly correspondence.

**Various Students and Correspondents**: Indian students studying in Britain who visited Müller, and Indian scholars who wrote to him about textual problems or scholarly questions.

## Themes and Scholarly Significance

### Cross-Cultural Intellectual Collaboration

The memoir illuminates how nineteenth-century Orientalist scholarship required genuine cross-cultural collaboration. European philological methods alone couldn't fully access Sanskrit traditions—European scholars needed Indian experts' knowledge of textual lineages, grammatical intricacies, ritual contexts, and interpretive traditions. Simultaneously, traditional Indian learning benefited from European manuscript cataloging, critical editing, printing technology, and comparative philological insights.

This collaboration was never equal—colonial power structures ensured European scholars retained control over scholarly production, credit, and financial rewards. Yet Müller's accounts reveal genuine intellectual exchange and personal relationships that complicated crude narratives of pure colonial exploitation or indigenous victimization.

### Recognition and Erasure

Müller's decision to dedicate an entire memoir volume to Indian collaborators represents unusual acknowledgment for the period. Most Victorian scholarly works credited only European authors, relegating Indian assistants to footnote acknowledgments if mentioned at all. By providing extended portraits of individual scholars with biographical details and intellectual achievements, Müller granted visibility often denied to indigenous contributors.

Yet even this appreciative recognition participated in asymmetrical relations—Müller wrote from professional security and scholarly eminence, describing Indians who depended upon European patronage. The memoir itself became Müller's property, adding to his literary output while his subjects remained largely unknown to wider audiences.

### Indigenous Knowledge Systems Under Colonialism

The work documents how traditional Sanskrit learning persisted during colonial rule despite British education policies privileging English. Indian pandits maintained textual expertise, grammatical knowledge, and interpretive traditions while adapting to colonial contexts—employment by European scholars, publication through colonial presses, engagement with European philological methods.

These scholars navigated complex positions: preserving indigenous knowledge while serving colonial knowledge production, maintaining traditional learning while engaging Western scholarly frameworks, asserting Indian intellectual authority while dependent upon European patronage.

### Personal Relationships and Structural Inequalities

Müller's reminiscences emphasize personal friendships, mutual respect, and genuine affection for his Indian collaborators. He describes emotional farewells, expressions of gratitude, and continuing correspondence revealing warmth beyond mere professional relationships. These personal dimensions complicate overly schematic accounts of colonial relations as purely exploitative.

Yet personal warmth couldn't eliminate structural inequalities: Müller gained professional prestige and Oxford professorship; his collaborators received modest payments and limited recognition. Müller remained in England with academic security; pandits like Ishwar Chandra left India to serve British scholarship. Publications appeared under Müller's name; Indian contributions were acknowledged in prefaces or omitted entirely.

## Reception and Legacy

### Contemporary Reception

The memoir received favorable notice in scholarly journals and literary reviews, praised for its appreciative treatment of Indian scholars and insights into Orientalist scholarship's collaborative dimensions. Some reviewers noted the work's revelations about European scholars' dependence on Indian expertise.

Indian nationalist intellectuals had mixed responses—some appreciated Müller's recognition of Indian scholarly contributions, while others critiqued the fundamental inequalities revealed in even this sympathetic account. The memoir documented both cross-cultural intellectual exchange and colonial asymmetries.

### Scholarly Significance for Postcolonial Studies

Contemporary scholars studying colonial knowledge production find *Auld lang syne: Second Series* valuable for:

**Collaborative Networks**: Evidence about how Orientalist scholarship required Indian intellectual labor, challenging myths of purely European scholarly achievement.

**Indigenous Agency**: Documentation of how Indian scholars navigated colonial structures while preserving and transmitting Sanskrit knowledge.

**Personal Dimensions**: Insight into human relationships underlying formal scholarly production, complicating purely structural analyses.

**Historiography**: Understanding how nineteenth-century European scholars conceptualized their relationships with Indian collaborators.

### History of Sanskrit Studies

The memoir provides invaluable documentation for histories of Sanskrit scholarship, revealing:

- Traditional Sanskrit learning's persistence during colonial period
- Methods of textual transmission and manuscript circulation
- Relationships between European philology and indigenous commentarial traditions
- Individual contributions of Indian scholars often anonymous in official publications
- Social conditions under which nineteenth-century Vedic and Sanskrit studies proceeded

## Contemporary Significance

Modern readers engage *Auld lang syne: Second Series* not as sentimental memoir but as historical source documenting:

**Colonial Knowledge Production**: How European Orientalism depended upon indigenous expertise while marginalizing contributors.

**Intellectual History**: The human networks, collaborative relationships, and cultural exchanges underlying nineteenth-century scholarship.

**Indian Intellectual Traditions**: Persistence and adaptation of Sanskrit learning during colonial rule.

**Biographical Recovery**: Information about individual Indian scholars whose contributions deserve historical recognition.

The work exemplifies both the possibilities and limitations of cross-cultural intellectual exchange under colonial conditions—genuine collaboration and personal warmth coexisting with structural inequalities and asymmetrical credit.
