# Mystics and Saints of Islam

## Overview

Published in 1910 as part of The Wisdom of the East series, *Mystics and Saints of Islam* by Claud Field offered English-reading audiences accessible introduction to Islamic mysticism during period of increasing Western interest in Eastern spiritual traditions. The work surveys Sufism—Islam's mystical dimension—through biographical sketches of major saints, examination of mystical poetry, and exposition of Sufi philosophical concepts including divine love (ishq), spiritual intoxication (sukr), annihilation of ego (fana), and union with the Divine.

Field's approach combined scholarly exposition with spiritual appreciation, presenting Sufism as profound mystical tradition comparable to Christian mysticism, Hindu bhakti devotion, and Buddhist meditation paths. Writing for general educated readers rather than academic specialists, he emphasized Sufism's universal spiritual themes—transcendence of ego, devotional love, ethical purification, and direct mystical experience of divine reality—that resonated with Western audiences increasingly interested in alternatives to conventional institutionalized religion.

The work's treatment of Indo-Islamic Sufism holds particular significance for understanding religious and cultural synthesis in South Asia. Field discusses the Chishti order, established in India by Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti of Ajmer in the twelfth century, which became one of Indian Islam's most influential mystical movements. He examines how Indian Sufism developed distinctive character through interaction with Hindu devotional traditions, attracting followers across religious boundaries and contributing to syncretic spiritual culture characterizing pre-modern Indian civilization.

By presenting Islamic mysticism sympathetically and emphasizing its spiritual depth and philosophical sophistication, Field challenged prevailing Western stereotypes of Islam as merely legalistic, militant, or fanatical religion. His work participated in early twentieth-century scholarly and popular reassessment of Islamic civilization's contributions to philosophy, literature, and spirituality.

## Author Background: Claud Field

Claud Field (dates uncertain, active late 19th-early 20th century) was British author and translator specializing in Islamic studies and Oriental literature during the late Victorian and Edwardian periods. While biographical details remain limited, his publications reveal sustained engagement with Persian literature, Islamic mysticism, and comparative religion.

### Literary Contributions

Field's published works included:

**The Wisdom of the East Series**: *Mystics and Saints of Islam* appeared in this influential series published by John Murray, which introduced Western readers to Asian philosophical and religious traditions through short accessible volumes by various authors.

**Persian Literature**: Field translated and wrote about Persian poetry, including works on Hafiz and other classical Persian poets, demonstrating competency in Persian language and familiarity with literary traditions.

**Islamic Studies**: His writings on Islam emphasized cultural, literary, and mystical dimensions rather than focusing exclusively on legal or theological aspects, contributing to more nuanced Western understanding of Islamic civilization.

Field represented early twentieth-century British Orientalist tradition at its more sympathetic—scholars who, despite operating within colonial context and sometimes perpetuating Orientalist assumptions, genuinely appreciated and sought to communicate the sophistication and spiritual depth of Islamic traditions to Western audiences.

## Structure and Content

### Organization

*Mystics and Saints of Islam* organizes material thematically and biographically rather than strictly chronologically. Field introduces Sufism's origins and fundamental concepts before presenting biographical sketches of major mystics, examining their teachings, poetry, and spiritual contributions.

The work covers:

**Origins of Sufism**: Early ascetic and mystical movements within Islam
**Major Sufi Figures**: Biographical accounts of influential saints and mystics
**Sufi Philosophy**: Concepts including fana, baqa, divine love, and spiritual stations
**Sufi Poetry**: Selections and analysis from Persian and Arabic mystical verse
**Sufi Orders**: Discussion of major tariqas (Sufi orders) and their practices
**Sufism in Different Regions**: Including significant attention to Indian Sufism

### Geographical and Cultural Scope

While covering Sufism across the Islamic world—Arabia, Persia, Turkey, Central Asia, North Africa—Field pays particular attention to Persian literary tradition and Indian Sufi movements, recognizing their historical importance and accessibility through translated literature.

## Major Sufi Figures and Themes

### Early Mystics and Ascetics

Field traces Sufism's origins to early Islamic ascetics who emphasized spiritual interiority, ethical purification, and devotional practice beyond mere legal observance. Key early figures include:

**Hasan al-Basri** (642-728): Early theologian and ascetic whose teachings emphasized repentance, fear of God, and ethical rigor, establishing foundations for later mystical developments.

**Rabia al-Adawiyya** (717-801): Female saint from Basra celebrated for pure divine love independent of hope for paradise or fear of hell. Her famous prayer, "O God, if I worship You for fear of Hell, burn me in Hell, and if I worship You in hope of Paradise, exclude me from Paradise. But if I worship You for Your Own sake, do not withhold from me Your everlasting beauty," exemplifies disinterested devotional love that became central to Sufi spirituality.

Rabia's emphasis on divine love (ishq) as spiritual path's highest expression profoundly influenced subsequent Sufi thought, shifting emphasis from ascetic renunciation toward ecstatic devotion and mystical union.

### Al-Ghazali (1058-1111)

Abu Hamid al-Ghazali represents pivotal figure who reconciled Sufi mysticism with orthodox Islamic theology and law. Field presents al-Ghazali's spiritual crisis—his abandonment of prestigious academic position and subsequent mystical awakening—as exemplifying intellectual limitations and experiential spiritual realization's necessity.

Al-Ghazali's major work *Ihya Ulum al-Din* (The Revival of Religious Sciences) systematically integrated Sufi spirituality with Islamic law (Sharia) and theology (Kalam), legitimizing mysticism within mainstream Islamic intellectual tradition. His argument that direct mystical experience (dhawq) complements rational knowledge established Sufism's respectability among scholars who previously viewed it with suspicion.

Field emphasizes al-Ghazali's teaching that external religious observance must accompany internal spiritual transformation—that ritual prayer, fasting, and pilgrimage possess both exoteric (zahir) dimensions of physical practice and esoteric (batin) dimensions of spiritual meaning accessible through mystical understanding.

### Persian Sufi Poets

Field devotes substantial attention to Persian mystical poetry, which expressed Sufi philosophy through sophisticated literary art accessible to both specialists and general audiences:

**Farid al-Din Attar** (c. 1145-1221): Persian poet whose allegorical masterpiece *The Conference of the Birds* (Mantiq al-Tayr) narrates thirty birds' quest for their king, the Simorgh, discovering finally that they themselves—purified through spiritual trials—are the divine presence they sought. Attar's work exemplifies Sufi teaching that the seeker and sought are ultimately one, that divine reality resides within purified consciousness.

**Jalal al-Din Rumi** (1207-1273): Perhaps most famous Sufi poet, Rumi (Mevlana) founded the Mevlevi order (whirling dervishes) and composed vast poetic corpus including the *Masnavi*, often called "the Quran in Persian." Field emphasizes Rumi's teachings on divine love as transformative force, the beloved's simultaneous transcendence and immanence, and the soul's yearning for reunion with its divine source.

Rumi's poetry employs rich symbolism—wine representing spiritual intoxication, the beloved symbolizing God, separation expressing the soul's exile from divine presence—creating multivalent verses functioning as both devotional literature and philosophical exposition.

**Hafiz** (1315-1390): Persian lyric poet from Shiraz whose ghazals (lyric poems) achieve remarkable synthesis of earthly and divine love, celebrating wine, beauty, and mystical intoxication in verses operating simultaneously on literal and metaphorical levels. Field discusses interpretive debates regarding whether Hafiz's poetry should be read literally or mystically—do his wine songs celebrate actual wine or spiritual ecstasy? Does the beloved represent human or divine beauty?

This interpretive ambiguity represents sophisticated poetic technique allowing multiple valid readings and reflecting Sufi teaching that divine beauty manifests through earthly forms.

### Mansur al-Hallaj (858-922)

Field presents the controversial martyr-mystic al-Hallaj, executed for his ecstatic utterance "Ana al-Haqq" (I am the Truth/Reality), which orthodox authorities condemned as blasphemous claim to divinity. Sufis interpret al-Hallaj's statement differently—not as individual ego claiming to be God, but as recognition that when ego is annihilated (fana), only divine reality remains, speaking through purified consciousness.

Al-Hallaj's martyrdom raised fundamental questions about mystical experience's relationship to religious law and authority. His execution exemplified ongoing tension within Islamic tradition between mystical claims of direct divine experience and legal-theological concern for maintaining orthodox boundaries.

## Sufi Philosophical Concepts

### Fana and Baqa

Field explains central Sufi concepts of fana (annihilation) and baqa (subsistence):

**Fana**: The annihilation or dissolution of individual ego-consciousness in mystical union with God. This doesn't mean physical destruction but transcendence of separate self-identity. The mystic realizes that individual existence is illusory—only God truly exists (wahdat al-wujud, unity of being). Fana represents death before death, the ego's voluntary dissolution allowing divine reality to manifest through purified consciousness.

**Baqa**: Subsistence in God following fana. Having transcended limited ego-identity, the mystic subsists in God, their actions becoming divine actions, their consciousness transparent to divine awareness. This represents highest mystical realization—the saint lives in world while consciousness remains united with divine reality.

These concepts parallel Hindu Vedantic teaching on transcending individual self (jiva) to realize identity with Brahman, and Buddhist teaching on anatta (non-self) and nirvana, suggesting universal mystical patterns across traditions.

### Divine Love (Ishq)

Sufi tradition emphasizes divine love as both means and goal of spiritual path. Field discusses how Sufis distinguished types of love:

**Muhabbat**: Initial love drawing seeker toward God
**Ishq**: Intense passionate love consuming ordinary consciousness
**Uns**: Intimate companionship with the Divine
**Wajd**: Ecstatic state produced by overwhelming divine presence

This progression mirrors stages of human romantic love—initial attraction, passionate intensity, intimate familiarity—applied to relationship between soul and God. Persian mystical poetry extensively employs romantic imagery—lover and beloved, separation and union, longing and fulfillment—as vehicles for expressing mystical experience.

### Spiritual Stations and States

Field explains Sufi psychology distinguishing between:

**Maqamat** (stations): Permanent spiritual attainments acquired through disciplined practice—repentance (tawba), patience (sabr), gratitude (shukr), trust (tawakkul), poverty (faqr), etc. Each station represents stable spiritual achievement marking progress along the path.

**Ahwal** (states): Temporary spiritual conditions granted by divine grace rather than earned through effort—joy, expansion, contraction, intimacy, awe, longing. States come and go, representing momentary divine gifts.

This psychological framework provided sophisticated map of spiritual development, guiding practitioners and enabling teachers to assess students' progress.

### Unity of Being (Wahdat al-Wujud)

Some Sufis, particularly Ibn Arabi (1165-1240), developed philosophical teaching of wahdat al-wujud—unity of being or existential monism. This doctrine holds that only God truly exists; apparent multiplicity and independent existence are illusory. All creation represents divine self-manifestation, differing only in degree of consciousness of its essential divine nature.

Field discusses how this philosophical position, while intellectually sophisticated, generated controversy among orthodox scholars who considered it potentially undermining religious law's significance and individual moral responsibility. If only God exists, what meaning do human actions and ethical choices possess?

## Sufism in India

### Historical Development

Field's treatment of Indian Sufism recognizes its distinctive character and historical importance. Islam reached India through multiple channels—Arab traders in coastal regions from seventh century, military conquests beginning in eighth century, and most significantly for Sufism's spread, through Sufi missionaries and saints from twelfth century onward.

Sufi orders established themselves across India, adapting to subcontinental religious and cultural context. The major orders included:

**Chishti**: Founded in India by Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti (1141-1236), who settled in Ajmer, Rajasthan. The Chishti order emphasized love, tolerance, humanitarian service, and sama (spiritual music and poetry). Chishti saints often maintained relationships with Hindu yogis and attracted devotees across religious boundaries.

**Suhrawardi**: Established by Shihabuddin Suhrawardi, this order maintained closer relations with political authorities while emphasizing orthodox practice alongside mystical realization.

**Qadiri**: Founded by Abdul Qadir Gilani of Baghdad, this order spread to India and emphasized adherence to Sharia alongside mystical practice.

**Naqshbandi**: Later arrival emphasizing silent dhikr (remembrance of God) and orthodox practice, sometimes taking more exclusivist stance than other orders.

### Syncretic Tendencies and Hindu-Muslim Interaction

Field discusses how Indian Sufism developed syncretic characteristics through interaction with Hindu devotional traditions:

**Shared Sacred Spaces**: Sufi shrines (dargahs) attracted both Muslim and Hindu devotees. The dargah of Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer became pilgrimage site for people of all religions, and this pattern repeated at numerous Sufi shrines across India.

**Conceptual Parallels**: Sufi concepts resonated with Hindu philosophical traditions—fana paralleled Vedantic realization of Brahman-Atman identity; divine love (ishq) resembled bhakti devotion; Sufi emphasis on guru-disciple relationship mirrored Hindu tradition. These parallels facilitated mutual understanding and exchange.

**Bhakti-Sufi Synthesis**: Devotional bhakti movements in Hinduism and Sufi traditions mutually influenced each other. Poet-saints like Kabir (1440-1518) drew on both Islamic and Hindu traditions, criticizing religious formalism while celebrating devotional love and direct spiritual experience. Though not strictly Sufi, Kabir exemplified syncretic spirituality flourishing where Sufi and bhakti traditions interacted.

**Persian Influence**: Sufism introduced Persian literary culture, poetry, and mystical concepts to India, enriching Indian Islamic culture. The Mughal courts patronized Persian literature, and mystical poetry by Rumi, Hafiz, and others circulated widely, influencing both Muslim and Hindu literary traditions.

### Notable Indian Sufi Saints

Field discusses several Indian Sufi saints:

**Moinuddin Chishti** (1141-1236): Founder of Chishti order in India, emphasized love, service to humanity, and religious tolerance. His shrine in Ajmer remains major pilgrimage destination.

**Nizamuddin Auliya** (1238-1325): Delhi-based Chishti master known for humanitarian service, devotional music, and famous disciples including Amir Khusrau, poet who pioneered Indo-Persian literary forms and popularized qawwali devotional music.

**Amir Khusrau** (1253-1325): Poet, musician, scholar who synthesized Persian, Arabic, and Indian cultural elements, composing poetry in Persian and creating musical forms that became foundational to North Indian classical music and devotional qawwali.

**Bulleh Shah** (1680-1757): Punjabi Sufi poet whose verses criticized religious orthodoxy, caste discrimination, and ritual formalism while celebrating mystical love and direct spiritual experience. His poetry, still widely sung, exemplifies Sufi universalism and social criticism.

## Comparative Perspectives

### Sufism and Christian Mysticism

Field, writing for Christian-majority British audience, draws parallels between Islamic and Christian mysticism to make Sufism comprehensible and respectable:

**Divine Love**: Sufi emphasis on divine love parallels Christian mystics including St. Teresa of Avila, St. John of the Cross, and medieval German mystics like Meister Eckhart.

**Union with God**: Sufi fana resembles Christian mystical union, though theological frameworks differ (Christian emphasis on participation in divine nature versus Sufi existential monism).

**Via Negativa**: Sufi apophatic theology—describing God through negation, emphasizing divine transcendence beyond attributes—parallels Christian negative theology in Pseudo-Dionysius and other mystical theologians.

**Asceticism and Renunciation**: Early Sufi asceticism resembles Christian monastic traditions emphasizing poverty, celibacy (for some Sufis), and renunciation of worldly attachments.

These comparisons positioned Sufism as legitimate mystical tradition comparable to respected Christian mysticism, challenging dismissive Western attitudes toward Islam.

### Universal Mystical Patterns

Field's approach suggests perennialist perspective—that genuine mystical experience across traditions shares common characteristics despite differing theological interpretations. This universalist view resonated with early twentieth-century interest in comparative religion and religious pluralism but has been criticized by scholars emphasizing how theological context fundamentally shapes mystical experience and interpretation.

## Reception and Influence

### Contemporary Reception

*Mystics and Saints of Islam* appeared during period of growing Western interest in Eastern spirituality, when works including Edwin Arnold's *Light of Asia* (on Buddhism) and translations of Hindu texts were introducing Asian religious traditions to popular audiences.

The work received generally positive reception for making Sufism accessible while maintaining scholarly respectability. It contributed to reassessment of Islamic civilization beyond political and military history, emphasizing cultural and spiritual contributions.

### Influence on Western Understanding

Field's work, along with others in The Wisdom of the East series and similar publications, contributed to:

**Humanizing Islam**: Presenting Islam as rich spiritual tradition, not merely legalistic or militant religion
**Introducing Sufi Poetry**: Making Persian mystical poetry accessible, contributing to later popularity of Rumi in Western culture
**Comparative Religion**: Encouraging framework viewing different religious traditions as valid spiritual paths
**Challenging Orientalist Stereotypes**: Though operating within Orientalist context, sympathetic treatments challenged most reductive stereotypes

### Academic Developments

Early twentieth-century popular works like Field's preceded more rigorous academic study of Sufism by scholars including Reynold Nicholson, Louis Massignon, Annemarie Schimmel, and others who established Islamic mysticism as legitimate scholarly field.

## Historical Significance

### Documenting Indo-Islamic Civilization

Field's attention to Indian Sufism documents important dimension of South Asian religious and cultural history—the role of Sufi movements in spreading Islam, facilitating Hindu-Muslim cultural exchange, and contributing to syncretic traditions characterizing pre-modern Indian civilization.

Understanding Indo-Islamic Sufism remains crucial for comprehending:
- How Islam established itself in predominantly Hindu context
- Cultural synthesis in Mughal and pre-Mughal periods
- Religious pluralism and interfaith relations in traditional India
- Development of Urdu language and Indo-Persian literature
- Qawwali music and devotional traditions
- Continuing role of Sufi shrines in South Asian religious life

### Contribution to Religious Studies

The work contributed to emerging field of comparative religion, demonstrating that serious study of non-Christian traditions could yield philosophical and spiritual insights relevant to universal human concerns.
