description: "Sir Jadunath Sarkar's monumental five-volume History of Aurangzib, published between 1912-1924, stands as the most authoritative and comprehensive account of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's reign (1658-1707), revolutionizing Indian historiography through unprecedented use of original Persian and Marathi sources and rigorous critical methodology. Sarkar (1870-1958), who began learning Persian from scratch to access primary chronicles and collaborated with Maharashtrian historian G.S. Sardesai to utilize Marathi documents, spent over a decade producing this magnum opus that transformed understanding of late Mughal history. The work's subtitle—'Mainly Based on Persian Sources'—signals its methodological innovation: whereas earlier histories relied on secondary accounts or limited sources, Sarkar systematically examined Persian chronicles in manuscript form, Marathi correspondence documenting Aurangzeb's attempts to suppress Marathas, and administrative records, creating history grounded in documentary evidence rather than legend or colonial interpretation. The five volumes progress chronologically: Volume I (1912) covers Aurangzeb's early years and accession war; Volume II (1912) addresses the first phase of his reign; Volume III (1916) examines the middle period; Volume IV (1919) treats the Deccan campaigns; Volume V (1924) concludes with Aurangzeb's final years and the empire's decline. Sarkar's methodology, influenced by European critical historiography (Ranke, Niebuhr, Mommsen) while maintaining literary sophistication, emphasized military tactics, sieges, and administrative details alongside political intrigue and religious policy. His approach concentrated on Aurangzeb's conflicts with Marathas under Shivaji—a subject Sarkar explored separately in Shivaji and His Times (1919)—demonstrating how Maratha resistance foreshadowed Mughal decline. The work's balanced treatment of Aurangzeb remains influential: neither hagiography nor demonization but complex portrait of a capable yet ultimately unsuccessful ruler whose religious orthodoxy and military overextension undermined imperial stability. Sarkar's achievement established standards for Indian historical scholarship: primary source utilization, linguistic competence in relevant languages, critical source evaluation, and narrative clarity. The History of Aurangzib demonstrated that rigorous, source-based Indian history could match European historiographical standards, countering colonial dismissals of Indian historical traditions while enabling Indians to reclaim their own past through scholarly investigation. The work remains essential for understanding late Mughal India, Aurangzeb's complex legacy, and the development of modern Indian historiography."
