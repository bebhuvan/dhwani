# The Life of Shivaji Maharaj

## Overview

"The Life of Shivaji Maharaj: Founder of the Maratha Empire" represents a seminal work in English-language biographical literature on Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, published in Bombay in 1921 by the Manoranjan Press. This 643-page comprehensive biography was adapted by N.S. Takakhav, a professor at Wilson College, Mumbai, from the original Marathi work by K.A. Keluskar, first published in 1907. The 1921 English edition incorporated fourteen years of accumulated research and new historical discoveries, transforming the work into what the authors themselves described as "a new and independent work" that subsequently served as the basis for a revised and enlarged second Marathi edition published early in 1921. The biography emerged during a critical period in Indian nationalist historiography, when colonial-era scholarship was being challenged by indigenous interpretations of pre-colonial Indian history.

Published at the height of the Indian independence movement, this work contributed to the nationalist project of recovering and reinterpreting indigenous heroes who resisted imperial domination. The biography appeared two decades after Bal Gangadhar Tilak's revival of Shivaji festivals in 1895, which had transformed the seventeenth-century Maratha leader into a symbol of anti-colonial resistance and Hindu self-assertion. The 1921 publication thus participated in the broader cultural and political movement that sought to demonstrate India's historical capacity for self-governance and military resistance against imperial powers, drawing explicit parallels between Shivaji's establishment of Hindavi Swarajya (self-rule of Hindu people) and contemporary demands for Home Rule under British colonialism.

The work's significance extends beyond its biographical content to its role in shaping nationalist consciousness during the 1920s, when the Indian National Congress was transitioning from constitutional methods to mass mobilization under Gandhi's leadership. Non-Brahman leaders from Gwalior and Baroda supported the book's publication and distribution, indicating its appeal across different social groups within the nationalist movement. The authors presented Shivaji not merely as a regional warrior but as the architect of a momentous national revival that changed the destinies of India, breathing new life into a people that for centuries had resigned itself to subjugation under successive Muslim sultanates and the Mughal Empire.

## About the Authors

Krishnarao Arjun Keluskar (1860-1934), known as K.A. Keluskar, was a pioneering Marathi biographer and historian from Kelus village in Vengurlya who established himself as the first major biographer of Shivaji in Marathi literature. Keluskar began writing "Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj" in 1903, with the first Marathi edition released in 1907 by the Maratha Provident Fund. His biographical approach combined rigorous research into historical sources with a narrative style accessible to general readers, distinguishing his work from purely academic histories. Beyond Shivaji, Keluskar authored biographies of Gautam Buddha and Sant Tukaram, demonstrating his versatility as a biographical writer committed to popularizing Indian historical and religious figures. His deep engagement with social reform movements and nationalist politics informed his interpretation of Shivaji as both a military genius and an administrative innovator who embodied ideals of good governance, religious tolerance, and indigenous sovereignty.

Nilakant Sadashiv Takakhav (N.S. Takakhav), born in 1879, was a distinguished scholar and professor at Wilson College in Bombay when he undertook the task of adapting Keluskar's Marathi biography into English. Takakhav's role transcended mere translation; he restructured the narrative for an English-reading audience, incorporated new historical materials discovered since 1907, and refined the scholarly apparatus to meet the standards of academic historical writing while maintaining the work's accessibility. His position at Wilson College, one of Bombay's premier institutions, provided him with access to both British colonial scholarship on Mughal and Maratha history and indigenous Marathi sources, enabling him to bridge these historiographical traditions. The collaborative nature of the 1921 edition reflected a productive tension between popular nationalist biography and scholarly historical research, with Takakhav's academic credentials lending authority to Keluskar's fundamentally nationalist interpretation of Shivaji's life and legacy.

The partnership between Keluskar and Takakhav exemplified the dual imperatives facing Indian intellectuals in the early twentieth century: to produce work that could meet colonial standards of evidence and argumentation while simultaneously serving the nationalist project of historical recovery and reinterpretation. Their biography navigated between hagiography and critical history, acknowledging Shivaji's military genius and administrative innovations while also addressing controversies and criticisms from both contemporary sources and modern historians. The authors' approach reflected the broader methodological challenges of nationalist historiography, which sought to establish indigenous frameworks for understanding Indian history while engaging with European historical methods and standards of evidence that dominated academic discourse during the colonial period.

## About Shivaji Maharaj

Chhatrapati Shivaji Bhonsle (1630-1680) was born on 19 February 1630 at Shivneri Fort near Junnar in present-day Pune district, to Shahaji Bhonsle, a Maratha general serving various Deccan Sultanates, and Jijabai, daughter of Lakhuji Jadhavrao of Sindhkhed. Shivaji's mother Jijabai played a formative role in his early education, instilling values of patriotism, courage, and justice that would define his later career as a state-builder and military commander. Growing up in Pune during a period when the Deccan was divided among three Islamic sultanates—Bijapur, Ahmednagar, and Golkonda—and increasingly threatened by Mughal expansion under Shah Jahan and later Aurangzeb, Shivaji witnessed firsthand the political instability and military conflicts that characterized seventeenth-century western India.

In 1645, at the age of fifteen, Shivaji launched his military career by capturing Torna Fort from the Bijapur Sultanate, initiating a decades-long campaign of territorial expansion that would establish Maratha dominance throughout the Deccan and western India. Over the next three decades, he captured approximately 300 forts through a combination of military conquest, diplomatic negotiation, and strategic alliances, creating a formidable defensive network that protected the Maratha heartland from both Mughal and Adilshahi invasions. His military innovations included the development of guerrilla warfare tactics known as Ganimi Kava, which utilized the rugged terrain of the Western Ghats for lightning-fast raids, ambushes, and tactical retreats that frustrated larger, better-equipped Mughal armies. Aurangzeb himself referred to Shivaji as a "Mountain Rat" in recognition of these tactics, which represented a significant departure from the conventional set-piece battles favored by Mughal commanders.

Shivaji's vision extended beyond military conquest to the establishment of a well-administered kingdom based on principles of religious tolerance, merit-based appointments, and protection of agricultural populations from excessive taxation and military depredation. On 6 June 1674, he was formally crowned as Chhatrapati (sovereign) of the Maratha Kingdom at Raigad Fort, a coronation that marked the formal establishment of an independent Maratha polity and asserted Hindu sovereignty in a region long dominated by Muslim sultanates. The coronation ceremony, conducted according to Vedic rituals by the Brahmin scholar Gaga Bhatt from Varanasi, provided religious and cultural legitimation for Shivaji's rule and established precedents for Maratha kingship that would be followed by his successors.

To administer his expanding kingdom, Shivaji instituted the Ashtapradhan (Council of Eight Ministers), an administrative innovation that distributed executive functions among specialized ministers including the Peshwa (Prime Minister), Amatya (Finance Minister), Sacheev (Secretary), Waqia-Navis (Interior and Intelligence), Senapati (Commander-in-Chief), Sumant (Foreign Minister), Nyayadhish (Chief Justice), and Panditrao (High Priest). This council system enabled efficient governance while preventing excessive concentration of power in any single office, demonstrating Shivaji's sophisticated understanding of administrative structures. Beyond territorial administration, he also pioneered the development of a Maratha navy, becoming the first Indian ruler of his era to recognize maritime power as essential for both trade and defense, establishing naval bases along the Konkan coast that challenged Portuguese and British maritime dominance.

Shivaji's conflicts with the Mughal Empire under Aurangzeb defined the latter portion of his reign and established the template for Maratha-Mughal relations that would continue until Aurangzeb's death in 1707. His most famous confrontation with Mughal power occurred in 1666 when, summoned to Agra by Aurangzeb, he was placed under house arrest but executed a daring escape by hiding in fruit baskets being sent out of the city. This episode, along with his successful raids on wealthy Mughal port cities like Surat in 1664 and 1670, demonstrated that Mughal military superiority was not absolute and that determined regional powers could successfully resist imperial expansion. His establishment of Hindavi Swarajya represented not merely territorial independence but also the assertion of cultural and religious autonomy, as he patronized Marathi language and literature, protected Hindu temples and Brahmin communities, while simultaneously maintaining policies of religious tolerance toward Muslims, Christians, and other religious minorities within his domain.

Shivaji died on 3 April 1680 at Raigad Fort after a brief illness, leaving behind a kingdom that controlled substantial portions of western and central India, defended by approximately 40,000 cavalry, 50,000 infantry, and a network of 300 fortified positions. His death precipitated a succession crisis between his elder son Sambhaji and younger son Rajaram, which temporarily weakened Maratha power and enabled Aurangzeb to launch a sustained Deccan campaign beginning in 1681. However, Shivaji's military and administrative legacy enabled the Marathas to resist Mughal conquest even after the execution of Sambhaji in 1689, ultimately fighting Aurangzeb to a stalemate that exhausted Mughal resources and contributed to the empire's subsequent decline in the eighteenth century.

## The Work

Keluskar and Takakhav's biography adopts a comprehensive chronological approach that traces Shivaji's life from his birth in 1630 through his military campaigns, administrative innovations, and death in 1680, while also examining the immediate succession crisis and its implications for Maratha power. The work draws extensively on Marathi bakhars—historical narratives written in Marathi prose that constitute the primary indigenous sources for seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Maratha history. More than 200 bakhars were written between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, with the Sabhasad Bakhar and 91 Kalami Bakhar considered the most reliable by scholars for their detailed accounts of Shivaji's administrative structures and military campaigns. The authors' use of these sources represented a significant methodological choice, privileging indigenous Marathi historiographical traditions over Persian chronicles written by Mughal court historians, which typically presented Shivaji as a rebel or bandit rather than a legitimate state-builder.

The biography presents Shivaji explicitly as a national hero whose significance transcends his role as founder of the Maratha Kingdom to encompass his status as a symbol of Hindu revival and resistance to Muslim domination. This interpretive framework, while reflecting the nationalist political context of the 1920s, also drew on earlier representations in the bakhars, which depicted Shivaji as an almost divine figure and an ideal Hindu king who overthrew Muslim dominion. The authors navigate between hagiographical elements inherited from bakhar traditions and critical historical analysis that acknowledges complexities and contradictions in Shivaji's career. Their treatment of controversial episodes—including Shivaji's assassination of Afzal Khan, his raids on wealthy cities, and his shifting alliances with various Deccan sultanates—attempts to contextualize these actions within the brutal military and political realities of seventeenth-century India.

The work's structure reflects the tension between popular accessibility and scholarly rigor, with extensive narrative passages describing military campaigns, diplomatic negotiations, and administrative reforms supplemented by critical annotations, source citations, and discussion of historiographical controversies. The authors examine Shivaji's guerrilla warfare tactics in detail, analyzing how his use of the Sahyadri mountains' terrain enabled successful resistance against numerically and technologically superior Mughal forces. They also devote considerable attention to his administrative innovations, particularly the Ashtapradhan council system and his revenue administration, which attempted to protect peasant cultivators from excessive taxation while extracting sufficient resources to maintain military forces. The biography emphasizes Shivaji's religious tolerance despite the work's broader framework of Hindu revival, noting his protection of Muslim religious sites, his employment of Muslims in administrative and military positions, and his prohibition against desecration of religious buildings during military campaigns.

Keluskar and Takakhav's treatment of sources demonstrates awareness of methodological challenges in reconstructing seventeenth-century history from materials written decades after events, often by authors with partisan perspectives. They acknowledge debates among historians regarding dating of specific events, the reliability of various accounts, and interpretations of Shivaji's motivations and objectives. The 1921 edition's incorporation of fourteen years of new research since Keluskar's original 1907 Marathi edition reflects the authors' commitment to historical accuracy alongside their nationalist interpretive framework. However, the biography ultimately serves nationalist objectives by presenting Shivaji as proof that Indians possessed both the military capacity and administrative sophistication necessary for self-governance, directly challenging colonial justifications for British rule based on alleged Indian political incapacity.

## Historical Significance

The biography's publication in 1921 positioned it within a crucial decade for Indian nationalism, occurring between the Rowlatt Act protests and Jallianwala Bagh massacre of 1919 and Gandhi's launch of the Civil Disobedience Movement in 1930. The work contributed to the nationalist movement's historical dimension, which sought to identify indigenous traditions of resistance and self-governance that could legitimate contemporary demands for independence. By presenting Shivaji as the architect of a successful military and administrative challenge to Mughal imperial expansion, the biography provided historical precedent for contemporary resistance to British imperialism. The explicit connections drawn between Shivaji's Hindavi Swarajya and Tilak's Swaraj slogan, adopted by the broader nationalist movement, made the biography politically significant beyond its scholarly or literary merits.

The transformation of Shivaji from a regional Maratha hero to a pan-Indian national figure began with Bal Gangadhar Tilak's organization of annual Shivaji festivals starting in 1895, which used the warrior king as a symbol to mobilize anti-colonial sentiment while avoiding direct criticism of British rule that might provoke sedition charges. Tilak's 1897 conviction for sedition, following his speeches invoking Shivaji's resistance to Mughal authority, demonstrated both the power and danger of this historical symbolism. Keluskar and Takakhav's 1921 biography participated in this ongoing project of Shivaji veneration, but attempted to ground it in scholarly historical research rather than purely political symbolism. The work's production by respected scholars with academic credentials rather than explicit political activists represented an attempt to move Shivaji's nationalist significance from the realm of festival oratory into established historical discourse.

However, the biography's nationalist framing also generated historiographical controversies that continue to shape scholarly debates about seventeenth-century Indian history. Critics have argued that imposing twentieth-century nationalist frameworks onto seventeenth-century political conflicts anachronistically attributes modern conceptions of nation, religious community, and anti-colonial resistance to historical actors operating within fundamentally different political and cultural contexts. Shivaji's conflicts with the Bijapur Sultanate and Mughal Empire reflected complex motivations including territorial expansion, revenue extraction, dynastic ambition, and regional power competition rather than articulated ideologies of Hindu nationalism or Indian independence. His alliances with Muslim commanders, his father Shahaji's service to various Deccan sultanates, and the multi-religious composition of Maratha military and administrative structures complicate simplistic narratives of Hindu-Muslim conflict or proto-nationalist resistance.

The biography's influence extended beyond scholarly circles to shape popular understanding of Shivaji and the Maratha Empire throughout the twentieth century, particularly in Maharashtra where he remains a potent symbol of regional and cultural identity. The work's accessibility in English enabled it to reach audiences beyond Marathi-speaking regions, contributing to Shivaji's elevation as a pan-Indian rather than exclusively Maharashtrian hero. However, this popularization also generated political controversies, as different groups appropriated Shivaji's legacy for competing political projects: progressive nationalists emphasized his administrative innovations and religious tolerance; Hindu nationalist movements highlighted his resistance to Muslim rule; and lower-caste movements debated his relationship to Brahmanical social hierarchies. These contested interpretations reflect broader tensions in Indian historiography between recovering indigenous historical perspectives marginalized by colonial scholarship and imposing contemporary political frameworks onto historical materials.

Subsequent historical scholarship has complicated Keluskar and Takakhav's nationalist interpretation while acknowledging the importance of their work in recovering Marathi sources and challenging colonial historiographical frameworks. Modern historians have emphasized the need to understand Shivaji within the specific context of seventeenth-century Deccan politics, characterized by unstable sultanates, expanding Mughal power, and complex multi-religious political coalitions that resist simple religious or proto-nationalist categorizations. The extensive administrative records from Shivaji's kingdom, many of which Keluskar and Takakhav utilized, have enabled more nuanced understanding of Maratha state formation, revenue administration, and military organization beyond hagiographical traditions. Nevertheless, the 1921 biography remains significant as both a primary source reflecting early twentieth-century nationalist historiography and as a scholarly work that helped establish Marathi bakhars as legitimate historical sources deserving serious academic attention.
