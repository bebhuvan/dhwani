# Indian Speeches (1907–1909)

## Overview

Published in 1910, *Indian Speeches (1907–1909)* collects the parliamentary addresses and policy statements delivered by John Morley, 1st Viscount Morley of Blackburn, during his tenure as Secretary of State for India from 1905 to 1910. The volume documents the legislative and administrative debates surrounding the Indian Councils Act of 1909, commonly known as the Morley-Minto Reforms, which Morley developed in collaboration with Viceroy Lord Minto. These speeches articulate the British Liberal government's response to escalating nationalist agitation following the 1905 partition of Bengal, the rise of the Swadeshi movement, and incidents of revolutionary violence that Morley characterized as "alarming symptoms of sedition."

The collection captures Morley's attempts to balance gradualist constitutional reform with the maintenance of imperial authority. Speaking before Parliament, Morley defended the expansion of legislative councils, the introduction of limited electoral representation, and the controversial provision for separate Muslim electorates—a demand successfully pressed by the newly formed All-India Muslim League (established December 1906). The speeches reflect the contradictions inherent in liberal imperialism: Morley simultaneously appointed "two distinguished native Indians to the Council of India" while sanctioning repressive measures against political extremists, including the 1907 deportation of Lala Lajpat Rai.

These addresses provide primary source documentation of British policy deliberations during a period when the Indian National Congress fractured at the December 1907 Surat session into moderate and extremist factions. Moderates like Gopal Krishna Gokhale anticipated that Morley's intellectual liberalism would yield sympathetic reforms, while extremists led by Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Lala Lajpat Rai, and Bipin Chandra Pal rejected constitutional petitioning in favor of mass mobilization and assertive nationalism.

## About the Author — John Morley (Viscount Morley)

John Morley (1838–1923) was a prominent Liberal politician, intellectual, and man of letters who served twice as Secretary of State for India (1905–1910 and briefly in 1911). Born in Blackburn, Lancashire, Morley left Oxford without an honors degree following a religious dispute with his father, an experience that shaped his 1874 work *On Compromise*. After abandoning legal practice—later described as "my long enduring regret"—he established himself in journalism, serving as editor of the *Pall Mall Gazette* (1880–1883) and becoming a leading voice in Radical-Liberal circles.

Morley's intellectual credentials were formidable. He authored biographical and philosophical studies of major Enlightenment and political figures, including *Voltaire* (1872), *Rousseau* (1873), *Diderot and the Encyclopaedists* (1878), *Burke* (1879), *Life of Richard Cobden* (1881), and *Life of Oliver Cromwell* (1900). His three-volume *Life of William Ewart Gladstone* (1903), written about his political hero, sold over 25,000 copies in its first year and was recognized as a masterly synthesis of sympathy and historical judgment. Contemporaries regarded him as "the last of the great nineteenth-century Liberals," embodying classical liberal principles of individual liberty, free trade, and opposition to state intervention.

Elected Liberal MP for Newcastle upon Tyne in February 1883, Morley served as Chief Secretary for Ireland (1886, 1892–1895) before assuming the India Office portfolio. His political philosophy evolved from early acknowledgment that "a certain protection [should be] thrown over classes of men and women who are unable to protect themselves" to a more doctrinaire opposition to statutory labor regulation by the 1890s, when he argued against "thrusting an Act of Parliament like a ramrod into all the delicate and complex machinery of British industry." He consistently opposed imperialism, delivering a famous 1899 Manchester speech against the Second Boer War warning that military action would be "wrong," regardless of tactical success.

Created Viscount Morley of Blackburn in 1908, he served as Lord President of the Council (1910–1914) before resigning from the cabinet in August 1914 in opposition to British entry into World War I as an ally of Russia. He was one of only four cabinet members to resign over the war, a decision reflecting his lifelong anti-imperialism. Historian Stanley Wolpert speculated that "but for the socially unpardonable circumstances surrounding his marriage," Morley might have become Foreign Secretary or Prime Minister. He died on September 23, 1923, at Wimbledon Park, London.

## The Work

**Scope and Methodology:**

The speeches address three interconnected policy domains. First, they document the constitutional mechanics of the Indian Councils Act 1909, which received royal assent on May 25, 1909. Morley explains the expansion of both central and provincial legislative councils, the introduction of a three-tier electoral system (local bodies elected an electoral college, which selected provincial legislature members, who then chose central legislature representatives), and the retention of an official majority in the central council while removing it from provincial councils. Elected Indian members gained parliamentary powers previously denied them: the right to table resolutions, debate budgetary matters, and ask supplementary questions. However, Morley articulates clear limitations—Indians could not discuss foreign policy or relations with princely states, and the British executive retained absolute veto power over all legislation.

Second, the speeches justify the most contentious provision of the reforms: separate electorates for Muslims. Following lobbying by the All-India Muslim League, which achieved its "first victory" when the government announced in February 1909 that it "accepted" Muslim demands for separate representation, the Act divided the electorate along religious lines. Muslim voters could vote only for Muslim candidates in reserved constituencies. Morley defends this communal principle in parliamentary debate, though he frames it as a temporary concession rather than a permanent constitutional feature. The Indian National Congress denounced separate electorates as "an imperial attempt at control through an elective policy of divide-and-rule," a criticism that would intensify in subsequent decades.

Third, the speeches address administrative responses to political unrest. Morley discusses measures taken against what he terms seditious activity, including deportations without trial under emergency regulations. He defends the May 1907 deportation of Lala Lajpat Rai to Burma (later reversed) and surveillance of extremist publications. Simultaneously, he emphasizes reformist gestures: the appointment of Indians to the Council of India in London and to the executive councils of Bombay and Madras Presidencies, and policies of administrative decentralization intended to demonstrate British good faith to moderate Indian opinion.

**Historical Context:**

The speeches engage with a moment of acute political crisis in British India. The October 16, 1905 partition of Bengal by Lord Curzon, which separated predominantly Muslim eastern districts from largely Hindu western areas, triggered the mass Swadeshi movement promoting indigenous goods and boycotting British manufactures. Leaders like Surendranath Banerjee organized protests that shut schools and shops on the partition date. The agitation radicalized Indian nationalism and accelerated the institutional split within the Indian National Congress.

At the December 1907 Surat session, the Congress formally divided into moderate and extremist factions with incompatible strategies. Moderates including Dadabhai Naoroji and Gopal Krishna Gokhale advocated "a peaceful and constitutional approach to achieving reforms" through petitions and dialogue with British authorities. Extremists known collectively as "Lal, Bal, Pal"—Lala Lajpat Rai, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and Bipin Chandra Pal—pursued aggressive mass mobilization, "building mass support by instilling a sense of self-respect, self-reliance, pride in their ancient heritage." Tilak's educational initiatives and publications spread nationalist consciousness beyond the English-educated elite that had dominated early Congress activity.

The formation of the All-India Muslim League on December 30, 1906, in Dacca added a communal dimension to constitutional negotiations. Founded during the annual All-India Muhammadan Educational Conference with support from approximately 3,000 delegates including Khwaja Salimullah (Nawab of Dacca), Hakim Ajmal Khan, and Mohammad Ali Jauhar, the League insisted that "separate electorates and reserved seats in the Imperial Council" be granted to protect Muslim political interests. British acceptance of this demand fundamentally altered the trajectory of Indian constitutional development.

## Significance

**Contemporary Reception:**

Moderate Indian nationalists initially welcomed Morley's appointment, anticipating that his intellectual liberalism and biographical study of Gladstone would translate into sympathetic reforms. Gokhale and other moderates engaged in sustained correspondence and negotiation with Morley, believing constitutional dialogue could achieve substantive gains. However, the limited scope of the 1909 Act disappointed those expecting responsible government or dominion status. Extremists dismissed the reforms as inadequate tokenism designed to co-opt moderates while preserving imperial control.

British parliamentary opinion divided along party lines. Liberals defended the reforms as prudent incremental progress, while Conservative critics questioned both the wisdom of admitting Indians to legislative deliberation and the security implications of tolerating nationalist agitation. Morley's speeches thus functioned as political justification aimed at multiple audiences: skeptical MPs, anxious British India officials, moderate Indian leaders whose cooperation was essential, and extremist critics whose influence he sought to marginalize.

**Later Assessment:**

Historians have evaluated the Morley-Minto Reforms as a transitional stage in constitutional development between the Indian Councils Act 1892 and the Government of India Act 1919, which introduced dyarchy (division of provincial subjects between reserved and transferred categories). The 1909 Act's expansion of legislative councils and introduction of electoral representation established institutional precedents that subsequent reforms built upon, though falling far short of self-governance.

The separate electorate provision generated sustained criticism. Congress leaders from the 1910s onward condemned communal electorates as a deliberate British strategy to fragment Indian nationalism along religious lines, accusations that intensified during constitutional negotiations in the 1930s and 1940s. Scholars have debated whether Morley genuinely believed separate representation would protect Muslim interests or cynically employed divide-and-rule tactics. The communal principle embedded in 1909 contributed to the political polarization that culminated in the 1947 partition.

Morley's speeches reveal the contradictions of liberal imperialism: professed commitment to Indian advancement coexisted with assertions of indefinite British supremacy. He appointed Indians to advisory bodies while deporting political dissenters without trial, expanded legislative participation while retaining absolute executive veto, and spoke of gradual progress toward self-government while rejecting any timeline for its achievement. These tensions reflect broader ambiguities in British liberal thought about empire, where theoretical commitments to liberty and representative government accommodated indefinite colonial subordination.

**Value for Researchers:**

The collection provides primary source evidence for multiple research domains. Constitutional historians examine the speeches for documentation of legislative intent behind the 1909 Act's provisions and the policy rationales articulated during parliamentary debate. Scholars of British liberalism analyze Morley's rhetoric for insights into how liberal political philosophy reconciled imperial governance with proclaimed principles of individual rights and self-determination. Historians of Indian nationalism study the speeches to reconstruct British perceptions of Indian political movements and the strategic calculations behind divide-and-rule accusations.

The texts also illuminate the institutional dynamics between the India Office in London and the Viceregal government in Calcutta. Morley's public statements sometimes diverged from internal memoranda and correspondence with Minto, revealing tensions between political imperatives in Westminster and administrative priorities in India. Researchers investigating Muslim League origins and the development of communal politics find in these speeches documentation of British official responses to Muslim separate electorate demands. The volume remains a crucial source for understanding how British policymakers conceptualized Indian political capacity during a formative period in the transition from crown rule to eventual independence.
