description: |
  G.A. Henty's "Through the Sikh War" (1893) dramatizes the Anglo-Sikh Wars (1845-1846, 1848-1849) that culminated in British annexation of the Punjab, following characteristic Henty formula of embedding fictional boy protagonist within historical military campaigns. The narrative presents British conquest of the Sikh Empire—then South Asia's most powerful indigenous military state, with modernized army, effective artillery, and formidable cavalry—as inevitable triumph of British military superiority and civilizational advancement over brave but ultimately inferior oriental forces. Henty's account oversimplifies complex political dynamics: internal Sikh factionalism following Maharaja Ranjit Singh's death, British diplomatic manipulation exacerbating succession crises, and deliberate British provocation that manufactured casus belli for wars explicitly aimed at territorial expansion. The novel celebrates battles at Mudki, Ferozeshah, and Sobraon as British military achievements while minimizing the wars' costs, bitter fighting, and narrow British victories that often resulted from Sikh commanders' treachery rather than British tactical superiority. Historical scholarship now recognizes the Anglo-Sikh Wars as naked imperial aggression against militarily capable opponent, with annexation of Punjab representing neither liberation nor civilizational progress but rather East India Company's elimination of last major obstacle to total subcontinental dominance. Henty's fiction performed crucial ideological work for late Victorian empire, transforming morally ambiguous conquest into adventure narrative celebrating British courage, discipline, and natural right to rule. The book's intended audience—British boys being prepared for imperial careers in military, civil service, or commerce—absorbed lessons about racial hierarchy, martial masculinity, and imperial mission through exciting battle scenes and heroic protagonists. As historical source, "Through the Sikh War" reveals less about actual Anglo-Sikh Wars than about how Victorian Britain represented its imperial expansion to itself and future generations, constructing mythologies of conquest that legitimized ongoing imperial projects while obscuring the violence, deception, and exploitation that characterized British rule in India.
