The Sushruta Samhita stands as one of the foundational texts of Ayurveda, alongside the Charaka Samhita, the Bhela Samhita, and the medical portions of the Bower Manuscript. This Sanskrit medical treatise represents one of the most important surgical texts to survive from the ancient world. Attributed to Sushruta, the name likely refers to the work of multiple authors spanning several centuries, similar to the attribution of texts to Hippocrates.

The dating of Sushruta and his compendium remains contested among scholars, with proposed dates ranging from 2000 BCE to the 6th century CE. Rudolf Hoernle proposed in 1907 that the text dates to the 6th century BCE based on connections to the Shatapatha Brahmana. However, the Chronology Committee of the National Institute of Sciences of India concluded in 1952 that the 3rd to 4th centuries CE represents the date of Nagarjuna's recension of the Sushruta Samhita, which remains the academic consensus. The text exhibits multiple historical layers, with composition possibly beginning in the last centuries BCE and reaching its present form through subsequent redactions. The oldest surviving manuscript is MS Kathmandu KL 699, a palm-leaf manuscript preserved at the Kaiser Library in Nepal, dated to 878 CE.

The Sushruta Samhita consists of 184 chapters (186 in its extant form) divided into six sections (Sthanas). The text documents 1,120 illnesses, 700 medicinal plants, 64 preparations from mineral sources, and 57 preparations based on animal sources. It describes over 300 surgical procedures and classifies human surgery into eight categories: Chedana (incising), Bhedya (excising), Lekhya (scraping), Vyadana (puncturing), Eshana (probing), Ahasrana (extracting), Visravya (draining), and Seevya (suturing).

The text meticulously catalogs 121 surgical instruments, divided into Yantras (blunt instruments) and Shastras (sharp instruments). These instruments were designed after the shapes of beasts and birds, resulting in names such as crocodile forceps and hawk's bill forceps. The Yantras were further classified into six types based on shape and utility. This systematic classification and documentation of surgical instruments represents an unprecedented achievement in ancient medical literature.

Sushruta's text is among the first medical treatises to recommend that students of surgery learn about the human body by systematically examining cadavers. This empirical approach to anatomical education distinguished Sushruta's methodology from contemporaneous medical traditions that relied primarily on theoretical knowledge.

The Sushruta Samhita provides detailed descriptions of plastic surgery techniques, particularly rhinoplasty. The text presents the first written record of the forehead flap rhinoplasty, a technique still employed in modern reconstructive surgery. This procedure was developed in response to rhinotomy, the amputation of the nose as punishment for crimes, which was a common practice in ancient India. The rhinoplastic techniques described by Sushruta involve nasal reconstruction using skin grafts from the patient's forehead or cheek. These methods became known as the "Indian flap" and established Sushruta as the originator of plastic surgery.

The text documents advanced ophthalmic procedures, including a sophisticated technique for cataract surgery known as "couching." This procedure involves displacing the clouded lens from the line of sight using a sharp instrument called the Jabamukhi Salaka. The Sushruta Samhita describes 76 eye diseases and provides detailed instructions for various ophthalmic surgeries, demonstrating remarkable specialization in this field.

Beyond surgical procedures, the Sushruta Samhita addresses multiple medical disciplines including toxicology, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, and the treatment of ulcers and fractures. The text emphasizes wound management, describing techniques for cleaning, suturing, and preventing infection. It documents the use of ants' heads to clamp wounds, wine for cleaning surgical sites, and various herbal preparations for postoperative care.

The Sushruta Samhita's influence extended far beyond the Indian subcontinent. In the early 8th century, the text was translated into Arabic as "Kitab Shah Shun al-Hindi" (also known as Kitab-e-Susrud) in Baghdad at the instruction of Yahya ibn Barmak. This translation contributed significantly to the foundation of medieval Islamic medicine, influencing renowned physicians such as Ibn Sina (Avicenna) and Al-Razi.

The transmission of Sushruta's knowledge through Arabic translations eventually reached medieval Europe. Latin translations of the Arabic versions served as foundational texts for European medical education through the medieval period. Passages from the Sushruta Samhita stimulated the development of modern plastic surgery in 19th-century Europe. There is evidence suggesting that Renaissance surgeons in Italy, including the Branca family of Sicily and Gasparo Tagliacozzi of Bologna, may have been familiar with the rhinoplastic techniques described in the text.

The translation by Kaviraj Kunja Lal Bhishagratna, completed in 1907, represents the first comprehensive English rendering of the Sushruta Samhita. Published in three volumes, Bhishagratna's work includes extensive commentary, comparative analysis with Western medical practices, detailed indices, glossaries, and medical illustrations. This translation made the ancient surgical knowledge accessible to English-speaking medical professionals and scholars, facilitating comparative studies between Ayurvedic and modern surgical techniques.

Bhishagratna's translation preserves the systematic structure of the original Sanskrit text while providing explanatory notes that contextualize Sushruta's procedures within the broader framework of medical history. The work demonstrates the sophistication of ancient Indian surgical practice and its contributions to the global development of medical science.

The Sushruta Samhita's emphasis on empirical observation, systematic classification, and detailed procedural documentation established methodological standards that presaged modern surgical practice. Its description of preoperative procedures, including patient preparation and instrument sterilization, reflects an understanding of surgical hygiene centuries before the development of germ theory.

The text's comprehensive approach to surgical education, including the recommendation for anatomical dissection and hands-on training with practice materials, established pedagogical principles that remain relevant in contemporary medical education. Sushruta advocated practicing surgical techniques on natural objects such as gourds, leather bags filled with water, and dead animals before operating on human patients.

The Sushruta Samhita represents a remarkable synthesis of theoretical medical knowledge and practical surgical expertise. Its influence on the development of surgery across multiple civilizations demonstrates the text's enduring significance in medical history. The sophisticated procedures, systematic classifications, and empirical methodology documented in the Sushruta Samhita established foundational principles that continue to inform surgical practice in both Ayurvedic and modern Western medicine.
