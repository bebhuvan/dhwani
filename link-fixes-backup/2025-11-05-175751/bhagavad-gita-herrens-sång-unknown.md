# Bhagavad-Gita: Herrens Sång

## Description

This Swedish translation renders the Bhagavad-Gita—the famous philosophical poem embedded in the Mahabharata epic—into accessible Nordic verse, preserving the spiritual teachings between Prince Arjuna and Lord Krishna. The text addresses core Hindu philosophical concepts including dharma (duty), detachment, and the eternal nature of the soul. Translated into Swedish, it makes Indian philosophical wisdom available to Scandinavian audiences.

## Central Philosophical Dialogue

The work opens on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, where Arjuna confronts devastating doubt about the morality of warfare against his own relatives. Krishna's teachings unfold as a comprehensive philosophical response, addressing action, renunciation, devotion, and knowledge—the multiple paths to spiritual realization. The dialogue format allows exploration of competing perspectives on ethics and spirituality.

## Religious and Philosophical Significance

The Gita presents systematic approaches to spiritual liberation through different temperamental types and paths. Krishna's teachings reconcile action with detachment, arguing that righteous duty performed without attachment to results constitutes spiritually valid practice. The text remains central to Hindu spiritual philosophy and has influenced global religious thought.
