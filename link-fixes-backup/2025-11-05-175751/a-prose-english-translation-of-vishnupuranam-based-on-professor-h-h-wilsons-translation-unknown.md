# A Prose English Translation of Vishnupuranam

## Description

This translation renders the Vishnu Purana, one of Hinduism's eighteen Mahapuranas, into accessible English prose, presenting Hindu cosmology, creation mythology, and the divine role of Vishnu. The text synthesizes philosophical teachings with devotional narratives, bridging sacred scripture and literary interpretation. Based on Professor H.H. Wilson's foundational scholarship, it serves scholars and religious practitioners seeking deeper understanding of Hindu metaphysics.

## Cosmological Framework

The Purana opens with dialogue between the sage Parashara and his pupil Maitreya, establishing Hindu temporal philosophy through descriptions of the four Yugas (ages) and cyclical processes of creation, maintenance, and destruction. Vishnu functions as the ultimate principle sustaining cosmic order and all manifest existence.

## Religious and Philosophical Significance

Core themes address dharma (righteous duty), the interconnection between divine principle and manifest reality, and paths to spiritual liberation. The text presents Hindu perspectives on human nature, cosmic law, and the relationship between the eternal and temporal through mythological narratives and philosophical discourse.
