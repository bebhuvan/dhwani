## Hazrat Inayat Khan: Musician, Mystic, and Pioneer of Universal Sufism

Hazrat Inayat Khan (1882-1927) stands as one of the most significant figures in the transmission of Sufi mysticism to the Western world. Born into a distinguished family of musicians in Baroda, India, Khan inherited both musical virtuosity and spiritual wisdom from his lineage. His grandfather, Maula Bakhsh, founded what would become the music faculty of the University of Baroda, and Khan himself became a full professor of musicology at the Gayanshala before the age of twenty. Yet his destiny extended far beyond the concert hall. Under the tutelage of his Sufi master, Sayyid Abu Hashim Madani of Hyderabad, Khan received a four-fold training in the mystical tradition, and upon completion, his teacher blessed him with prophetic words: "Fare forth into the world, my child, and harmonize the East and West with the harmony of thy music. Spread the wisdom of Sufism abroad."

In September 1910, Khan sailed for America, accompanied by his brothers Maheboob Khan and cousin Mohammed Ali Khan. Together, they toured as the Royal Hindustani Musicians, introducing Indian classical music to Western audiences for the first time. However, Khan's mission transcended musical performance. He sought to adapt the ancient wisdom of Sufism for a new audience, one steeped in Christian and secular traditions rather than Islamic ones. This was a bold and controversial undertaking. Though Khan remained a devout Muslim who followed the Sharia throughout his life, he made the strategic decision to present Sufism without emphasizing its intrinsic connection to Islam, acutely aware of the Euro-American prejudice against Islamic traditions in his era. By 1914, he had established the Sufi Order in London, and by the time of his death in 1927, centers had been established throughout Europe and North America.

Khan's philosophy of "Universal Sufism" emphasized the oneness of God (tawhid) and the underlying harmony of revelations communicated by prophets of all the world's great religions. His teachings ranged across religion, art, music, ethics, philosophy, psychology, and healing, but remained grounded in the Sufi concept of wahdat-al-wajood (unity of being). While primarily inspired by Muslim Sufi traditions, Khan developed a universalist system that sought consistencies with all religious paths, believing that when face to face with ultimate truth, the perspectives of Krishna, Buddha, Christ, and other prophets converge. His works, including "The Mysticism of Sound and Music" and "The Heart of Sufism," became modern classics, beloved not only by Sufi practitioners but by musicians and spiritual seekers of all traditions.

## The Sufi Poetry Tradition: Divine Love and the Metaphor of the Beloved

"Hindustani Lyrics" emerges from a rich tradition of Sufi poetry that stretches back centuries, deeply rooted in the ghazal form and the Persian-Urdu literary tradition. The ghazal, which traces its origins to 7th-century Arabic poetry, spread into the Indian subcontinent in the 12th century through the influence of Sufi mystics. Amir Khusrau (1253-1325), disciple of the great Sufi master Nizamuddin Auliya, is revered as the "father of the ghazal" in the subcontinent. Khusrau introduced the Persian ghazal to Indian soil and brilliantly combined it with local vernaculars such as Hindavi, laying the groundwork for what would become Urdu poetry. His ghazals frequently examine the soul's yearning for its celestial Beloved, expressing intense spiritual devotion and mystical experiences through the language of earthly love.

At the heart of Sufi poetry lies the theme of ishq-e-haqiqi (divine love), where the Sufi poet envisions God as the Beloved, a presence so alluring and overwhelming that it consumes the seeker's soul entirely. Most ghazals can be read on multiple levels: on the surface as expressions of romantic longing, yet simultaneously as spiritual allegories in which the Beloved represents God or the poet's spiritual master. This dual nature reflects the Sufi understanding that the intense longing of human love serves as both metaphor and pathway to Divine Love. The lover in these verses experiences separation (hijr), yearning (talab), intoxication (masti), and ultimately, the annihilation of the self (fana) in union with the Beloved. This spiritual framework profoundly shaped Urdu love poetry, creating a tradition where erotic and mystical vocabularies became inseparable.

The 19th century witnessed the flowering of this tradition in the works of masters such as Mirza Ghalib (1797-1869), whose ghazals explored love, loss, betrayal, and Sufi mysticism with unparalleled sophistication. Ghalib's verses reconciled with the metaphysical concept of wahdat-al-wajood, maintaining the paradox that our non-existence proves superior to existence, that in losing ourselves we find ultimate truth. Other poets whose works appear in "Hindustani Lyrics," including verses attributed to Amir (likely Amir Khusrau) and Zafar (Bahadur Shah Zafar II, the last Mughal emperor and accomplished poet), continued this tradition of using the imagery of earthly love to express spiritual realities. The collection thus represents a great wealth of love poetry, both secular and mystical, celebrating the union of the human soul with the Divine under various allegories and metaphors.

## Jessie Duncan Westbrook and the Art of Translation

Jessie Duncan Westbrook (1873-1927) emerged as a significant figure in the early 20th-century movement to translate Oriental literature for Western audiences. Born Jessie Ewing Duncan in Scotland, she married in 1894 and became known as Westbrook. She specialized in translating poetry from Persian, Urdu, and Hindi, contributing to the growing Western fascination with Eastern wisdom and literature. Her translation work positioned her within a broader cultural moment: the height of British imperial engagement with India and the simultaneous scholarly interest in Oriental studies that had been building since the late 18th century.

Westbrook's collaboration with Inayat Khan produced multiple works, including "Hindustani Lyrics" (published by The Sufi Publishing Society in London, 1919) and "Songs of India" (1915). Earlier, she had worked with Magan Lal to translate "The Diwan of Zeb-un-Nissa: The First Fifty Ghazals" (London: John Murray, 1913), published in the prestigious "Wisdom of the East" series. This series, which spanned nearly a century and produced at least 128 titles under various publishers, was edited by L. Cranmer-Byng and S.A. Kapadia during its first two decades. The series aimed to bring together West and East in a spirit of mutual sympathy, goodwill, and understanding, gathering wisdom, philosophy, poetry, and ideals from India, China, Japan, Persia, Arabia, Palestine, and Egypt. Each volume sold for five shillings, making Eastern literature accessible to a broad educated readership.

Westbrook's translation style in "Hindustani Lyrics" reflects what one contemporary source describes as "typical of the outgoing Victorian age." This characterization is revealing: her renderings employ the elevated diction, formal syntax, and romantic sensibility that marked late Victorian and Edwardian poetry. The translations prioritize lyrical beauty and emotional resonance over literal accuracy, seeking to convey the spiritual essence and emotional intensity of the original Urdu verses in a form that would appeal to English readers familiar with Romantic and Victorian poetic conventions. This approach was common in the era, following the precedent set by Edward Fitzgerald's phenomenally successful translation of Omar Khayyam's "Rubaiyat" (1859) and Richard F. Burton's translation of "The Arabian Nights" (1884). Like these earlier translators, Westbrook sought to create English poems that could stand as literature in their own right, even as they mediated between two distinct poetic traditions.

## Early 20th-Century Context: Orientalism, Empire, and Cultural Exchange

"Hindustani Lyrics" appeared during a complex historical moment characterized by the intersection of colonialism, Orientalist scholarship, and genuine cross-cultural exchange. The late 18th century through the early 20th century saw European, particularly British, scholars develop extensive linguistic and cultural expertise in Eastern traditions. Pioneering figures such as Sir William Jones, who founded the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1784, and William Carey, the linguist and missionary, published extensive studies of Indian laws, culture, and languages. This scholarship, while often serving imperial aims, also generated genuine appreciation for Eastern literary and philosophical traditions.

By the Edwardian period, British engagement with Indian culture had become deeply ambivalent. On one hand, the British Empire maintained political and economic domination over India, justified through narratives of civilizational superiority. On the other hand, educated British and American audiences increasingly sought Eastern spirituality and literature as alternatives to what they perceived as the materialism and spiritual emptiness of Western modernity. The translations of the "Wisdom of the East" series, including Westbrook's work, served this hunger for Eastern wisdom while simultaneously making that wisdom palatable to Western sensibilities through familiar literary conventions.

Inayat Khan's mission to the West occurred at the cusp of profound global changes. The expansion of the British Empire had created networks of travel and communication that enabled unprecedented cultural exchange. Educated Indians increasingly traveled to Europe and America, bringing not just performances and scholarship but lived traditions of spirituality and art. Khan's decision to present Sufism in universal rather than specifically Islamic terms reflected both strategic necessity and genuine philosophical conviction. The early 20th century witnessed significant anti-Islamic prejudice in Europe and America, rooted in centuries of religious conflict and more recent colonial anxieties. By framing Sufism as a universal mystical tradition compatible with Christianity, Buddhism, and other faiths, Khan made it accessible to Western seekers while remaining true to Sufism's own understanding of divine unity transcending all particular forms.

The publication of "Hindustani Lyrics" thus represents multiple convergent currents: the continuation of 19th-century Orientalist interest in Eastern literature; the emergence of new modes of cultural exchange enabled by colonial networks but transcending colonial power dynamics; the adaptation of traditional forms to modern audiences; and the beginning of a significant transfer of Eastern spiritual teachings to the West that would accelerate throughout the 20th century. The collection offered Western readers access to the sophisticated tradition of Urdu Sufi poetry, mediated through Victorian literary conventions yet carrying the authentic spiritual intensity of the mystical tradition. Reading these poems today, we encounter both the beauty of the original tradition and the fascinating historical moment of their translation—a moment when East and West engaged in imperfect but genuine dialogue through the universal language of poetry and spiritual longing.

The collaboration between Inayat Khan and Jessie Duncan Westbrook stands as an example of cross-cultural partnership at a time when such collaborations were rare but increasingly necessary. Khan brought deep knowledge of the mystical tradition, musical training, and philosophical sophistication; Westbrook contributed linguistic skill, poetic sensibility, and understanding of English literary taste. Together, they created a bridge between traditions, rendering the Divine Love celebrated by Sufi poets accessible to readers who might never encounter the original Urdu or Persian texts. While contemporary readers may find the Victorian-inflected translations somewhat dated in style, the spiritual essence remains luminous: the soul's passionate yearning for union with the Beloved, whether that Beloved be understood as God, Truth, Beauty, or the deepest reality underlying all existence.
