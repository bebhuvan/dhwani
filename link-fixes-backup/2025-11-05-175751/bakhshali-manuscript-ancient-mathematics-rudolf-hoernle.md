# The Bakhshali Manuscript: Ancient Indian Mathematics

## Overview

The Bakhshali Manuscript was unearthed in 1881 by a peasant in a field near the village of Bakhshali, close to Mardan in present-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. This collection of 70 incomplete leaves written on birch bark in Sharada script represents perhaps the oldest extant manuscript in Indian mathematics, containing sophisticated mathematical content that demonstrates advanced knowledge of arithmetic, algebra, and computational methods. The manuscript's dating has been the subject of intense scholarly controversy, with radiocarbon analysis conducted in 2017 initially suggesting wildly divergent dates across different folios—ranging from AD 224-383 for folio 16, to 680-779 for folio 17, and 885-993 for folio 33.

The 2024 revised findings from Oxford University corrected these dates, establishing that the manuscript dates to 799-1102 AD (9th-11th century), with folio 16 redated to AD 931-1032. The earlier 2017 date for folio 16 was officially labeled "inaccurate," resolving some of the chronological confusion. This dating controversy drew public criticism from mathematicians including Kim Plofker, who objected to the Bodleian Library's announcement strategy that employed a "newspaper press-release" approach bypassing peer review processes. The manuscript's fragmented nature and the divergent dates across folios suggest it may be a compilation of materials from different periods rather than a single unified text.

The mathematical significance of the Bakhshali Manuscript lies in its use of a dot symbol (shunya-bindu) as a placeholder for zero within a place-value numerical system, predating the 9th-century Gwalior temple inscription previously considered the earliest Indian zero symbol. Written in Sanskrit with local dialect influences, the manuscript demonstrates computational sophistication and pedagogical clarity that influenced the development of mathematical notation and methods across Asia.

## About the Manuscript

The manuscript consists of 70 incomplete birch bark leaves preserved in the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford (catalogued as MS. Sansk. d. 14), where it remains too fragile for direct handling. Following its discovery in 1881, the fragments remained undeciphered for several years until they were sent to August Friedrich Rudolf Hoernle, a distinguished philologist and Indologist who had earned recognition for his 1878 comparative grammar of north Indian languages, which won him the Volney Prize from the Institut de France. Hoernle successfully decoded the fragments and identified them as "a portion of a lost ancient Indian arithmetical treatise," publishing his analysis and illustrations of Bakhshali numerals in 1887.

Hoernle's decipherment revealed a text written in an earlier form of Sharada script, demonstrating his expertise in tracing the chronological evolution of Brahmi script, early Gupta script, and related writing systems. His work established the manuscript as a crucial document for understanding the development of mathematical notation in the Indian subcontinent. Following Hoernle's initial studies, G.R. Kaye undertook further editorial work, publishing a complete edition in 1927 that provided additional scholarly analysis of the mathematical content and historical context.

The physical condition of the manuscript reflects both its considerable age and the circumstances of its burial and recovery. The birch bark medium, commonly used in northern India and Central Asia for manuscript production, has deteriorated significantly, leaving gaps in the text and making comprehensive reconstruction challenging. Despite these preservation issues, the surviving folios contain sufficient material to demonstrate the scope and sophistication of the mathematical knowledge they encode.

## The Work

The mathematical content of the Bakhshali Manuscript encompasses rules and illustrative examples covering arithmetic, algebra, and geometry, including operations with fractions, methods for extracting square roots, arithmetic and geometric progressions, linear and quadratic equations, indeterminate equations, and practical measurement problems. Each mathematical example follows a consistent pedagogical pattern: a problem statement, the solution procedure, and verification of the result—a teaching method similar to that employed in Bhaskara I's later commentary on the Aryabhatiya.

The manuscript's treatment of practical problems addresses mercantile calculations, mixture problems, and other applications relevant to commercial and administrative contexts. These examples demonstrate the application of abstract mathematical principles to concrete situations involving trade, currency exchange, and resource allocation. The text employs specialized terminology for mathematical operations and quantities, revealing a well-developed technical vocabulary for mathematical discourse in Sanskrit.

The notation system represents a crucial innovation in mathematical writing. The manuscript uses a dot symbol (shunya-bindu) as a placeholder within a place-value numerical system, enabling the representation of numbers with positional significance for each digit. This notational advance allowed for more compact and systematic representation of numbers and facilitated computational procedures. The manuscript also employs specific symbols and abbreviations for mathematical operations and unknown quantities, demonstrating a movement toward symbolic algebra beyond purely verbal problem descriptions.

The computational methods include approximation techniques for square roots that achieve considerable accuracy through iterative refinement. The treatment of indeterminate equations shows sophisticated algebraic reasoning, while the geometric content addresses area and volume calculations relevant to land measurement and construction. The mathematical rigor varies across different sections, with some passages providing detailed proofs or justifications while others present rules without explicit derivation.

## Historical Significance

The Bakhshali Manuscript occupies a critical position in the history of mathematical notation and the development of the decimal place-value system that became foundational to global mathematics. The manuscript's use of the zero symbol as a placeholder predates other known Indian examples, contributing to scholarly understanding of how this crucial mathematical concept emerged and evolved. The zero concept, already implicit in earlier Indian mathematical astronomy through the use of place-value notation, receives explicit symbolic representation in this text, marking a significant stage in the abstraction and formalization of mathematical thought.

The manuscript provides evidence for the transmission of mathematical knowledge across the Indian subcontinent and potentially beyond, as mathematical methods and notational systems developed in India influenced Islamic mathematics during the medieval period. Arab scholars who encountered Indian mathematical texts, including works employing similar notational systems and computational methods, translated and adapted these materials, facilitating their eventual transmission to Europe where they transformed European mathematics during the Renaissance.

The pedagogical approach evident in the manuscript's structure—presenting problems, solutions, and verifications—reflects a teaching tradition that prioritized understanding through worked examples rather than purely abstract exposition. This educational methodology influenced subsequent mathematical texts in the Sanskrit tradition and parallels teaching approaches found in other mathematical cultures. The manuscript's practical orientation, addressing problems relevant to commerce and administration, demonstrates the integration of mathematical knowledge with economic and social activities.

Scholarly debates concerning the manuscript's dating have implications for understanding the chronology of mathematical development in South Asia. The corrected 9th-11th century dating places the manuscript within a period of significant mathematical activity in India, contemporary with the works of mathematicians such as Mahavira (9th century) and preceding Bhaskara II (12th century). This chronological placement situates the Bakhshali Manuscript within a broader mathematical tradition while raising questions about its relationship to known mathematical texts and authors from the same period. The manuscript's anonymous authorship and fragmentary preservation make definitive conclusions about its origins and influences difficult, but its survival provides direct material evidence for mathematical practices that might otherwise be known only through later copies or references.
