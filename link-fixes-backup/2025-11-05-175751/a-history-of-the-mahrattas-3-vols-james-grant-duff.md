  Captain James Grant Duff's three-volume history of Marathas published 1826, first comprehensive colonial historiographical account following Third Anglo-Maratha War, based on unprecedented access to state papers and temple archives during his tenure as Resident of Satara. Written during the early phase of British colonial consolidation in Western India, this work emerged at a critical juncture when the Maratha political power was rapidly declining after their decisive defeat in 1818, and British colonial administrators were systematically documenting and interpreting regional histories to establish administrative and intellectual hegemony. Duff, a Scottish military officer and East India Company administrator who served in the Bombay Presidency between 1809 and 1828, represented a generation of scholar-administrators who combined military experience, bureaucratic access, and emerging colonial ethnographic methodologies to produce foundational texts that would significantly shape European understandings of Indian historical trajectories.

# A History of the Mahrattas (3 Volumes)

Captain James Grant Duff's three-volume *History of the Mahrattas*, published in 1826 by Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown, and Green, stands as "the first serious attempt to write a comprehensive history of the Mahrattas" within the colonial historiographical tradition. Emerging from the immediate aftermath of the Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817-1818), which dismantled Maratha power and consolidated British supremacy, this monumental work served simultaneously as scholarly achievement, administrative manual, and imperial apologia, embodying the contradictions of colonial knowledge production.

## Author Background and Administrative Context

James Grant Duff (1789-1858), a Scottish soldier-administrator, exemplified the Company officer who combined military service with scholarly pursuits in service of empire. Born in Scotland, Duff arrived in India as a young officer in the East India Company's military establishment, quickly distinguishing himself through linguistic ability and cultural engagement. He "quickly mastered the Marathi, Urdu, and Persian languages and became well known for his ability to cut through the cultural divide"—skills that positioned him as valuable intermediary between British administration and Maratha political elites.

Duff's appointment in 1818 as Resident of Satara State proved decisive for his historical project. This position, established following the British defeat of the Maratha Confederacy, made him supervisor of the restored Satara ruling house under Company suzerainty. The Residency system—whereby British political agents monitored and controlled ostensibly independent princely states—represented colonial governance's indirect rule face. As Resident, Duff wielded immense power over Satara's internal affairs while cultivating relationships with Maratha nobility whose political independence had just been crushed.

This administrative role granted Duff "peculiarly favorable opportunities to collect materials for his history," including "unrestricted access to state papers, documents and temple archives" and "personal acquaintance with the Mahratta chiefs." His position allowed systematic extraction of historical materials from families, temples, and state repositories—a colonial archival practice that transferred indigenous documentary heritage into British custody and interpretative frameworks. Duff's connections to Mountstuart Elphinstone, Governor of Bombay and himself a historian of India, further embedded his work within elite colonial administrative-scholarly networks.

After retiring to Scotland around 1822 due to health concerns, Duff devoted himself to composing his history from accumulated materials. He inherited estates in Scotland and Fife, securing the financial independence that enabled sustained scholarly work. His eldest son, Mountstuart Elphinstone Grant Duff (named for his father's patron), later became Under-Secretary for India and Governor of Madras Presidency, illustrating how colonial administrative dynasties perpetuated themselves across generations.

## Scholarly Methodology and Sources

Duff's history rested on exceptionally rich source materials accessed through his political position. He consulted "state papers, family and temple archives," Persian-language court chronicles (bakhars), Marathi documentary records, and oral testimonies from Maratha participants in recent events. His linguistic competence in Marathi and Persian enabled direct engagement with indigenous sources rather than relying on translators—relatively unusual among British historians of this period. This access produced what contemporaries and later scholars acknowledged as "comprehensive and thorough," constituting "the best history of its kind for decades."

The work's geographical scope reflected Maratha power's territorial extent, covering "the south as far as Tanjore, including Mysore, and extends to the north which includes Gujarat, Malwa, and Bundelkhand." Duff traced Maratha expansion from seventeenth-century origins under Shivaji through the Peshwa period's imperial zenith to final collapse before British arms. His narrative emphasized military campaigns, political intrigues, and dynastic successions—the conventional political history privileged by nineteenth-century historiography.

However, Duff's access to indigenous sources coexisted with interpretative frameworks shaped by colonial ideology and British strategic interests. His research occurred in context of recent military conquest; his informants included defeated elites dependent on British favor for survival. This power asymmetry fundamentally structured the historical knowledge produced. Maratha sources were filtered through questions and categories derived from British administrative concerns, while alternative narratives threatening colonial legitimacy could be excluded or dismissed.

The history's organization and narrative arc reflected British imperial perspectives. Duff presented Maratha expansion as predatory and destabilizing, Maratha governance as inefficient and corrupt, and British conquest as inevitable restoration of order. His detailed military narratives demonstrated professional soldier's interest in campaign strategy while portraying Maratha forces as brave but ultimately primitive compared to British military science.

## Contemporary Reception and Enduring Influence

Upon publication in 1826, Duff's history received immediate recognition within British imperial and scholarly circles as the definitive English-language account of Maratha history. Its detailed documentation, comprehensive scope, and apparent firsthand authority made it required reading for East India Company officers serving in former Maratha territories. The work provided historical justification for British rule, explaining Company ascendancy as culmination of Maratha political fragmentation and internal weakness.

The history's influence proved particularly profound in colonial education. "Duff's history was translated into the major languages of Western India, becoming required reading for Indian students during the British Raj." These translations—into Marathi, Gujarati, and other vernaculars—shaped how educated Indians understood their own past, internalizing colonial narratives and periodizations. Multiple generations of Indian students learned Maratha history through Duff's interpretations, which emphasized British military superiority and administrative efficiency while portraying Maratha governance as anarchic.

British administrators used Duff's work as practical manual for governing former Maratha territories. His detailed accounts of Maratha administrative systems, revenue practices, and political relationships informed colonial policy-making. The history's genealogical information about Maratha families helped officials navigate complex networks of kinship and obligation. In this sense, the text functioned as imperial intelligence, turning historical knowledge into governmental technique.

Within historical scholarship, Duff's work remained authoritative for decades, particularly in Anglophone contexts. His status as eyewitness to the final Maratha period and access to now-dispersed archival materials made the history an essential source even for scholars critical of its interpretations. The text's detailed factual information—dates, genealogies, campaign narratives—became standard reference points, shaping subsequent historiography even as interpretative frameworks evolved.

## Colonial Bias and Historical Distortion

Modern scholarship recognizes that "as is to be expected, his history is laced with considerable colonial prejudice," manifesting in stereotypical portrayals, causal explanations that justified British conquest, and systematic erasure of perspectives challenging colonial legitimacy. Duff's text exemplified colonial historiography's ideological functions: delegitimizing indigenous governance, naturalizing British supremacy, and constructing historical narratives that made empire appear inevitable and beneficial.

Specific distortions became embedded in historical understanding through Duff's influence. The pioneering Indian historian Jadunath Sarkar, working with Persian and Marathi sources in the early twentieth century, "established, based on Persian and Marathi sources, different interpretations of key events, and Duff's portrayal resulted in impressions persisting for a long time among Indians." Sarkar's meticulous archival research revealed how Duff had misrepresented crucial episodes, omitted inconvenient evidence, and imposed interpretations serving British interests. "Public indignation against Grant Duff was later somewhat allayed, and the Marathas rejoiced at Jadunath's irrefutable logic in clearing certain historical controversies."

These distortions included portraying Maratha expansion as purely predatory while ignoring revenue administration's sophistication, depicting Maratha military prowess as barbaric rather than strategically innovative, and presenting the Peshwa period's political complexity as chaos requiring British intervention. Duff systematically excluded or minimized evidence of Maratha administrative achievements, cultural patronage, and diplomatic sophistication that contradicted colonial narratives of Indian incapacity for self-governance.

The history's treatment of individual leaders reflected colonial racial hierarchies and character typologies. Figures who cooperated with British interests received sympathetic treatment; those who resisted appeared as fanatic or irrational. Shivaji, safely historical and useful as contrast to later "degeneracy," received qualified praise; contemporary Maratha leaders were depicted as corrupt and incompetent. These characterizations served to delegitimize resistance to colonial rule.

## Postcolonial Reassessment and Critical Scholarship

Contemporary historians approach Duff's work as valuable but deeply compromised source requiring critical distance and contextual analysis. Postcolonial scholarship recognizes how the text's apparent documentary richness conceals epistemological violence—the appropriation of indigenous historical materials into frameworks that denied Indian historical agency and complexity. The history exemplifies colonial knowledge production's extractive character: utilizing Indian sources, informants, and archival resources while excluding Indian interpretative authority.

Modern Maratha historiography, particularly Marathi-language scholarship, has systematically recovered alternative narratives and indigenous historical frameworks that Duff marginalized or excluded. Research in Marathi bakhars, family archives, and temple records reveals sophisticated historical consciousness within Maratha tradition that Duff accessed but fundamentally misunderstood or deliberately misrepresented. These indigenous sources present Maratha expansion not as predatory anarchy but as state-building project with complex administrative structures, ideological legitimation, and cultural patronage networks.

Critical reassessment also examines how Duff's administrative position shaped his historical perspective. As Resident of Satara, charged with maintaining British supremacy while managing Maratha elite, Duff had vested interest in portraying pre-colonial Maratha governance as chaotic and British rule as stabilizing. His informants—defeated nobles dependent on Company favor—could not safely articulate alternative narratives. The history thus reflects power relations of post-conquest moment when British domination was militarily secure but ideologically contested.

Scholars now recognize how Duff's influential work established enduring distortions in Maratha historiography that subsequent scholarship has struggled to overcome. His periodization schemes, causal explanations, and character assessments became naturalized assumptions replicated in later works. Even scholars critical of colonial interpretations often worked within frameworks Duff established, testament to colonial historiography's lasting epistemological power.

However, postcolonial reassessment also acknowledges Duff's relative sophistication compared to cruder forms of colonial historical writing. His genuine engagement with indigenous sources, linguistic competence, and detailed documentation preserved materials and information valuable for contemporary historians, even as his interpretations require rejection. The history's factual substrate, carefully extracted from ideological framing, remains useful research resource.

Contemporary approaches emphasize reading Duff against himself—using evidence he preserved against conclusions he drew, recovering subaltern perspectives from gaps and contradictions in his narrative, and contextualizing his interpretations within colonial ideology and British strategic interests. This critical recuperation treats Duff's history not as objective account but as historical artifact revealing both Maratha past and colonial knowledge production's operations.

Decolonizing Maratha historiography requires not merely correcting Duff's errors but fundamentally questioning the categories, periodizations, and narrative structures colonial scholarship imposed. This involves centering Marathi-language sources and indigenous scholarly traditions, recovering non-elite perspectives marginalized in political histories, and examining how colonial conquest's violence shaped historical memory and documentation. Duff's monumental work, once authoritative, now serves primarily as object of historiographical analysis—testament to how imperial power shapes historical knowledge and the ongoing project of recovering colonized peoples' own historical consciousness.
