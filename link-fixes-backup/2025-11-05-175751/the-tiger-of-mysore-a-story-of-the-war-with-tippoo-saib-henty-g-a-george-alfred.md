description: |
  G.A. Henty's "The Tiger of Mysore" (1895) exemplifies Victorian boys' adventure fiction set against the backdrop of the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1798-1799), culminating in the British East India Company's defeat and death of Tipu Sultan at Seringapatam. Henty, prolific author of over 140 historical adventure novels for young readers, constructed formulaic narratives combining historical events with fictional protagonists who witness and participate in pivotal moments, serving both as entertainment and as vehicles for inculcating imperial values, martial virtue, and racial hierarchies in British youth. The novel follows a British boy's adventures through Tipu Sultan's Mysore, presenting the Mysorean ruler as simultaneously noble savage and oriental despot, brave but cruel, worthy opponent but ultimate threat requiring British intervention. Henty's fiction operated as pedagogy, teaching generations of British boys their place in imperial hierarchy while naturalizing conquest through adventure narrative's pleasures. The work portrays the Anglo-Mysore Wars through explicitly partisan lens: British expansion appears as civilizing mission, Tipu's resistance as fanatical tyranny, and the final siege of Seringapatam as triumph of superior British character and military skill. Historical scholarship now recognizes Tipu Sultan as sophisticated ruler who modernized Mysore's administration, economy, and military while resisting East India Company expansion, making Henty's caricature both politically motivated and historically reductive. The novel's significance lies less in historical accuracy than in its function as imperial propaganda for juvenile readers, exemplifying how adventure fiction served British imperialism by constructing heroic narratives of conquest that obscured violence, exploitation, and resistance. As cultural artifact, "The Tiger of Mysore" reveals Victorian imperial ideology at its most accessible and insidious—entertaining stories that shaped boyhood imaginaries, normalizing empire as natural theater for British masculine achievement while rendering colonized peoples as either loyal subordinates or savage antagonists requiring subjugation.
