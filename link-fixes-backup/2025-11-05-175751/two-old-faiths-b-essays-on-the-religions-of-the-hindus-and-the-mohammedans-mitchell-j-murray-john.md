  J. Murray Mitchell's "Two Old Faiths: Essays on the Religions of the Hindus and the Mohammedans" exemplifies nineteenth-century Christian missionary scholarship that combined genuine study of Indian religious traditions with explicit apologetic aims of demonstrating Christianity's superiority and facilitating conversion. Mitchell, Scottish Presbyterian missionary who spent decades in India, approached Hinduism and Islam as theological systems to be understood, respected as ancient wisdom traditions, yet ultimately refuted through comparative analysis that would reveal Christianity's unique claims and universal truth. The work represents comparative religion's complicated genealogy: the discipline emerged partially from missionary encounters with non-Christian traditions, requiring serious study to enable effective evangelization, yet this very study sometimes generated respect and appreciation that complicated simple triumphalist narratives. Mitchell's essays demonstrate extensive knowledge of Hindu philosophy, Islamic theology, Sanskrit and Arabic texts, and contemporary Indian religious practice, reflecting his immersion in Indian intellectual culture and genuine engagement with Indian religious thought. Yet his hermeneutic remained fundamentally Christian and supersessionist, reading Hindu and Islamic traditions as partial revelations awaiting fulfillment in Christian truth, noble but limited human attempts to grasp divine reality fully revealed only in Christ. The comparative approach—examining Hinduism and Islam together—reflected missionary strategic thinking: understanding both India's major non-Christian traditions as variants of natural religion or human spiritual seeking, distinguished from Christianity as supernatural revelation. The work provides valuable documentation of nineteenth-century Hindu and Islamic thought, practice, and reform movements as observed by educated, intellectually serious Christian outsider, offering perspectives shaped by extended residence and study but ultimately subordinated to theological commitments. As historical source, "Two Old Faiths" illuminates both the religious traditions it examines and the Christian missionary worldview that framed that examination, revealing how colonial encounter generated new forms of religious knowledge production characterized by simultaneous learning and assertion of religious hierarchy.
