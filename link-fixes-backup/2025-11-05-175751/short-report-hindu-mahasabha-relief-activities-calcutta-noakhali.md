## Historical Context and Partition Background

This document represents a critical primary source from one of the most turbulent periods in South Asian history, produced during the final year before the 1947 Partition of India. The report chronicles humanitarian relief efforts undertaken in response to two catastrophic episodes of communal violence that would fundamentally reshape the political geography of the subcontinent and crystallize the religious divide between Hindu and Muslim communities in Bengal.

The genesis of these riots lies in the complex interplay of colonial politics, economic grievances, and religious mobilization that characterized late colonial India. By 1946, the demand for Pakistan by the All-India Muslim League under Muhammad Ali Jinnah had gained considerable momentum, while the Indian National Congress remained committed to a united India. The Bengal province, with its delicate demographic balance and history of Hindu-Muslim tensions exacerbated by the 1943 Bengal Famine, became a crucial battleground for these competing visions of post-colonial South Asia.

## The Great Calcutta Killings: Direct Action Day, August 1946

On 16 August 1946, the Muslim League declared Direct Action Day to demand a separate Muslim homeland after British withdrawal from India. What began as a call for general strikes and economic shutdown in Calcutta rapidly descended into four days of unprecedented communal carnage that would become known as the Great Calcutta Killings. The violence claimed between 5,000 to 10,000 lives, with approximately 15,000 wounded, though independent sources suggest the death toll may have reached 8,000. The worst killing occurred on 17 August, when the city witnessed indiscriminate murder, widespread arson, looting of shops, and the ransacking of arms and ammunition stores whose weapons were subsequently deployed in further rioting.

The violence exhibited a terrifying pattern of targeted killings and retaliatory attacks. Initial assaults on Hindu-majority areas were followed by Hindu reprisals against Muslim neighborhoods, creating a cycle of violence that overwhelmed civil authority. The colonial administration's response proved inadequate until 21 August, when Bengal was placed under direct Viceregal rule and five battalions of British troops, supported by four battalions of Indian and Gurkha soldiers, were deployed to restore order. The Great Calcutta Killings stand as probably the most notorious single massacre of the 1946-47 period, setting a catastrophic precedent that would reverberate across the subcontinent.

## The Noakhali Riots: October-November 1946

The news of Calcutta's carnage triggered a wave of retaliatory violence in the eastern districts of Bengal. The Noakhali riots began on 10 October 1946, deliberately timed to coincide with Kojagari Lakshmi Puja, and continued unabated for approximately one week. This was not spontaneous mob violence but rather semi-organized massacres, systematic rape and abduction of Hindu women, and coordinated looting and arson of Hindu properties perpetrated across more than 2,000 square miles of territory. The affected areas included Ramganj, Begumganj, Raipur, Lakshmipur, Chhagalnaiya, and Sandwip police stations in Noakhali district, and Hajiganj, Faridganj, Chandpur, Laksham, and Chauddagram police stations in Tipperah district.

The Noakhali violence must be understood within the context of longstanding economic tensions in eastern Bengal. The Muslim majority in these districts, predominantly agricultural and economically disadvantaged, had long depended on Hindu moneylenders for agricultural credit and basic financial needs. The Great Depression of the 1930s, which caused jute prices to plummet, had severely strained relations between Hindu creditors and Muslim debtors. This economic resentment, combined with political mobilization around religious identity and the inflammatory news from Calcutta, created a volatile mixture that exploded into coordinated violence targeting the Hindu minority.

## Hindu Mahasabha Relief Operations

The Hindu Mahasabha's response to these crises represents a significant, though controversial, chapter in the history of humanitarian relief during the partition period. Upon receiving news of the Noakhali atrocities, the organization mobilized rapidly under the leadership of prominent figures including Ashutosh Lahiry, who immediately departed for Chandpur, and Syama Prasad Mookerjee, Nirmal Chandra Chatterjee, and other leaders who flew to Comilla with military escorts. The relief operation demonstrated considerable organizational capacity: the Mahasabha requisitioned aircraft to dispatch supplies including rice, bread, milk, and medicines, while additional relief materials were transported by train to affected areas.

The relief infrastructure established by the Hindu Mahasabha was extensive and systematic. Officials including M.L. Biswas, P. Bardhan, and J.N. Banerjee were deployed to affected areas to establish relief centers equipped with mobile medical units. A well-equipped 25-bed hospital was inaugurated in Lakshmipur to provide medical care to riot victims. This rapid mobilization built upon the organizational experience the Hindu Mahasabha had gained during the Bengal Famine of 1943-44, when it had conducted large-scale relief operations for Hindu victims.

However, the political dimensions of this humanitarian work cannot be ignored. The Hindu Mahasabha's relief efforts were intrinsically connected to its communal political agenda and its advocacy for the partition of Bengal along religious lines. The organization's selective focus on Hindu victims and its framing of the violence reflected and reinforced communal identities at a critical historical juncture. Recent scholarship, particularly Adhijit Sarkar's research on the Bengal Famine relief, has demonstrated how the Hindu Mahasabha instrumentalized humanitarian crises to advance its political objectives and consolidate Hindu communal consciousness.

## Gandhi's Contrasting Peace Mission

The Noakhali riots prompted a dramatically different response from Mahatma Gandhi, whose peace mission to the region stands in sharp contrast to the Hindu Mahasabha's communally-oriented relief work. Gandhi arrived in Noakhali and Tipperah districts on 6 November 1946 and remained until the end of February 1947. Over nearly three months, he walked barefoot across 116 miles, visiting 47 villages devastated by violence. His mission focused not merely on material relief but on spiritual and communal reconciliation. Gandhi conducted prayer meetings that brought together members of both communities, encouraged interfaith dialogue, prayed with survivors, engaged with Muslim villagers, and sought to rebuild trust between communities torn apart by bloodshed. His approach emphasized non-violence, mutual understanding, and the reconstruction of the moral fabric of society rather than the consolidation of communal identities.

## Historiographical Significance

This document holds considerable value for understanding the complex historiography of partition violence. A new wave of scholarship emerged in India during the 1990s that reconsidered partition violence that had previously been regarded as better forgotten, though the Calcutta riots and Noakhali violence remain somewhat marginal in the dominant nationalist narrative. Current scholarly literature reveals two main interpretive frameworks: one emphasizing continuity with the growing pattern of inter-communal violence in Bengal throughout the 1940s, and another situating the violence within the specific context of partition politics and emphasizing its instrumentality to various political actors' goals.

The Hindu Mahasabha's relief report constitutes a significant primary source that illuminates several critical aspects of this period. First, it provides detailed documentation of the scale and nature of relief operations undertaken by a Hindu communal organization during a humanitarian crisis. Second, it reveals the organizational capacity and political motivations of the Hindu right during the crucial pre-partition period. Third, it serves as evidence for understanding how humanitarian relief became entangled with communal politics and the consolidation of religious identities that would facilitate partition.

Recent historiographical work, including research by scholars such as Joya Chatterji and Adhijit Sarkar, has focused attention on the role of Hindu organized groups, particularly those linked to the Hindu Mahasabha, in shaping the discourse around partition and communal violence. Chatterji's work emphasizes the activities of organizations such as Bharat Sevashram Sangha, which was closely aligned with the Mahasabha. Sarkar's 2020 study of the Bengal Famine reveals how the Hindu Mahasabha exploited that earlier crisis to advance its communal agenda, providing important context for understanding its relief activities in 1946.

The document also contributes to understanding the complex political landscape of 1946 Bengal, where the Hindu Mahasabha cooperated with the Muslim League in forming short-lived coalition governments while simultaneously engaging in relief work that reinforced communal divisions. This apparent contradiction reflects the intricate maneuvering of various political actors during the partition period, when humanitarian concerns, political ambitions, and communal identities intersected in complicated ways.

## Scholarly Implications and Contemporary Relevance

From a historiographical perspective, this report must be read critically, recognizing both its documentary value and its propagandistic dimensions. It provides invaluable data about the scale of violence, the logistics of relief operations, and the immediate responses to humanitarian crisis. Simultaneously, its selective framing, emphasis on Hindu victimhood, and communal interpretation of events reflect the political agenda of its authors. This dual character makes it an ideal text for teaching students about the complexities of using politically-motivated primary sources to reconstruct historical events.

The document contributes to ongoing scholarly debates about the nature and causes of partition violence. Was this violence primarily spontaneous eruptions of communal hatred, carefully orchestrated political strategy, or some combination of both? The Hindu Mahasabha's organized relief response, documented in this report, suggests significant organizational capacity and political coordination on the part of communal organizations. This evidence supports interpretations that emphasize the instrumental use of violence and relief work to consolidate communal identities and political constituencies.

Furthermore, this report illuminates the gendered dimensions of partition violence, though often through silence and euphemism. References to abductions and the systematic targeting of women reflect the particular vulnerabilities faced by women during communal riots and the ways in which women's bodies became sites of communal conflict. Subsequent scholarship on partition violence has paid increasing attention to these gendered aspects, drawing on testimonies and documents like this report.

The report also raises important questions about the ethics and politics of humanitarian relief in contexts of communal conflict. When does relief work cross the line from humanitarian assistance to political mobilization? How do we evaluate relief efforts that undoubtedly saved lives but also reinforced communal divisions? These questions remain relevant in contemporary contexts of ethnic and religious conflict worldwide, making this document not merely of historical interest but of continuing ethical and political significance.

## Archival Context and Preservation

The preservation and digitization of this document through repositories such as the Internet Archive and Google Books represents an important development in the democratization of historical knowledge. Previously, such documents were accessible only to researchers who could visit specific archives, often in India or other South Asian locations. Digital access enables a global community of scholars, students, and interested readers to engage with primary sources from this crucial period. This accessibility facilitates comparative research, enables verification of scholarly claims, and allows diverse interpretive communities to engage with the historical record.

However, the digital availability of such politically-charged documents also raises questions about contextualization and interpretation. Without adequate historical framing, readers may misunderstand or misuse these materials. The importance of scholarly mediation, critical analysis, and ethical engagement with difficult historical materials becomes even more crucial in the digital age.

## Conclusion

The "Short Report of Hindu Mahasabha Relief Activities During 'Calcutta Killing' and 'Noakhali Carnage'" stands as a vital historical document that captures a pivotal moment in South Asian history. It records not only the humanitarian crisis created by partition-era violence but also the complex interplay of relief work and political mobilization that characterized this period. The report provides essential evidence for understanding how communal organizations responded to humanitarian disasters, how relief efforts intersected with political agendas, and how the events of 1946 set the stage for the massive violence and displacement that would accompany the 1947 partition.

For contemporary scholars and students, this document offers a window into the lived experience of communal violence and its aftermath, the organizational structures of Hindu communal politics, and the ways in which humanitarian crises became opportunities for political mobilization. It reminds us that historical events are always experienced and recorded through particular perspectives, and that our understanding of the past must account for the political and ideological contexts in which historical documents were produced. The Noakhali riots and the Great Calcutta Killings were not isolated incidents but integral parts of the broader process through which British India was violently partitioned into India and Pakistan, a process whose consequences continue to shape South Asian politics and society to the present day.
