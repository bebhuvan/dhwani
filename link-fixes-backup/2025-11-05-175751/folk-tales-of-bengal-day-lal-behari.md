description: 'The Reverend Lal Behari Day''s ''Folk-Tales of Bengal'' represents a
  pioneering effort in the preservation and literary transmission of Bengali oral
  traditions, published with a preface dated February 27, 1883. As one of the earliest
  substantial collections of Bengali folk narratives rendered into English by an Indian
  author, the work holds a unique position in the history of folklore studies and
  vernacular literature. Day (1824-1894), a Bengali Christian convert, educator, and
  author who bridged indigenous storytelling traditions and colonial literary culture,
  undertook this project at the suggestion of Sir Richard Carnac Temple, a British
  India administrator with scholarly interests in Indian folklore. Temple encouraged
  Day to create ''an amalgamation of those unwritten stories that old women in India
  recited to little children in the evenings,'' recognizing the value of documenting
  oral traditions that were already beginning to fade. The resulting collection preserves
  twenty tales featuring the characteristic elements of Bengali folklore: magical
  transformations, virtuous princes and princesses, clever animals, wicked stepmothers,
  tests of loyalty, and the interweaving of everyday village life with supernatural
  intervention.

  Day''s preface establishes both the personal and cultural significance of this undertaking.
  He recalls with nostalgic affection the hundreds—perhaps thousands—of folk tales
  he heard as a child from an old woman known as ''Shambhu''s Mother,'' who served
  as his household''s storyteller. Years later, when he set out to compile these narratives,
  Day discovered that storytellers like the long-dead Shambhu''s Mother had become
  rare, their oral repertoires dying with them as social changes disrupted traditional
  village life. After searching in vain for storytellers who could recreate the tales
  of his childhood, Day eventually found a Bengali Christian woman who shared some
  narratives from her own memory. This frame establishes the collection''s dual character:
  it is simultaneously an act of cultural preservation, rescuing vanishing oral traditions
  from oblivion, and a work of literary translation, transforming oral performances
  into written texts for both Bengali and English-speaking audiences. The opening
  tale, ''Life''s Secret,'' exemplifies the collection''s themes—a story of two queens,
  jealousy, magical protection (Prince Dalim Kumar''s life is bound to a boal fish),
  and the triumph of virtue over wickedness—while demonstrating the intricate plot
  structures and symbolic richness of Bengali narrative tradition.

  The significance of Day''s work extends beyond its content to its cultural politics
  and its place in the emergence of vernacular literary consciousness during the colonial
  period. By collecting, translating, and publishing these tales, Day participated
  in the broader nineteenth-century project of documenting folk traditions, a movement
  that encompassed the Brothers Grimm in Germany, the collectors of Norse sagas, and
  numerous colonial ethnographers recording indigenous narratives worldwide. However,
  Day''s position as an Indian Christian collecting Hindu folk traditions complicates
  simple narratives about cultural preservation. His work bridges multiple worlds:
  he was educated in missionary schools and deeply influenced by Western literary
  forms, yet he maintained strong connections to Bengali cultural traditions; he wrote
  in English for a partially British audience, yet he aimed to validate Bengali storytelling
  as worthy of serious literary attention. The folk tales he collected often feature
  Hindu deities, festivals, and cultural practices, demonstrating that his Christian
  conversion did not erase his cultural heritage or his appreciation for the narrative
  traditions in which he was raised.

  The collection''s lasting value lies in its preservation of narrative patterns,
  character types, and cultural details that illuminate Bengali social life and imaginative
  worlds in the mid-nineteenth century. The tales reflect village society''s structure,
  gender relations, family dynamics, religious practices, and moral frameworks. They
  document belief in magic, the importance of fate and destiny, the power of curses
  and blessings, the significance of performing proper rituals, and the conviction
  that virtue will ultimately be rewarded and wickedness punished. Day''s relatively
  straightforward prose style, while perhaps losing some of the oral performance''s
  vitality and the specific textures of the original Bengali, makes the tales accessible
  to English readers while preserving essential plot structures and cultural elements.
  The tales have been illustrated in various editions, notably by the acclaimed artist
  Warwick Goble in a beautiful 1912 edition, further securing their place in the international
  folklore canon.

  Modern readers should approach this collection with awareness of both its achievements
  and its limitations. Day''s Christian perspective and his address to a partially
  British audience may have influenced his selection and presentation of tales, perhaps
  emphasizing moral lessons or downplaying elements that might seem too pagan or foreign.
  His position as cultural intermediary—explaining Bengali traditions to outsiders—inevitably
  involves simplification and translation losses. The move from oral performance to
  fixed text transforms fluid narratives that varied with each telling into stable
  literary objects, potentially losing the interactive dimensions of traditional storytelling.
  Nevertheless, ''Folk-Tales of Bengal'' remains an invaluable record of nineteenth-century
  Bengali narrative tradition, offering insights into a rich storytelling culture
  while documenting the early stages of Indian vernacular literature''s emergence
  into print and international circulation. The collection should be read alongside
  other folklore compilations, contemporary scholarship on oral traditions, and critical
  analyses of how folklore collection served various cultural and political purposes
  during the colonial period. When so contextualized, Day''s work reveals much about
  cultural transmission, the negotiation of tradition and modernity, and the complex
  processes by which oral traditions enter written culture and global literary circulation.'

## Overview

The Reverend Lal Behari Day's 'Folk-Tales of Bengal' represents a pioneering effort in the preservation and literary transmission of Bengali oral traditions, published with a preface dated February 27, 1883. As one of the earliest substantial collections of Bengali folk narratives rendered into English by an Indian author, the work holds a unique position in the history of folklore studies and vernacular literature. Day (1824-1894), a Bengali Christian convert, educator, and author who bridged indigenous storytelling traditions and colonial literary culture, undertook this project at the suggestion of Sir Richard Carnac Temple, a British India administrator with scholarly interests in Indian folklore. Temple encouraged Day to create 'an amalgamation of those unwritten stories that old women in India recited to little children in the evenings,' recognizing the value of documenting oral traditions that were already beginning to fade. The resulting collection preserves twenty tales featuring the characteristic elements of Bengali folklore: magical transformations, virtuous princes and princesses, clever animals, wicked stepmothers, tests of loyalty, and the interweaving of everyday village life with supernatural intervention.
