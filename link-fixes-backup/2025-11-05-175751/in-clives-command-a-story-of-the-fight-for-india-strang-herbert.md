# In Clive's Command: A Story of the Fight for India

## Overview

Herbert Strang's "In Clive's Command: A Story of the Fight for India" (1900) offers a compelling historical adventure that intertwines personal narrative with the monumental events of British colonial expansion in India. The novel follows Desmond Burke, a restless young man whose desire to escape the constraints of provincial English life collides with the grand historical moment of General Robert Clive's military campaigns. Through Burke's journey, Strang explores themes of ambition, heroism, and the formative experiences that shape individual character against the backdrop of imperial conquest.

## Character and Setting

The narrative opens in the autumn of 1754 in Market Drayton, where the return of local hero Colonel Clive creates a fervor of excitement. Desmond Burke, energized by Clive's exploits and oppressed by his domineering older brother Richard at home, dreams of adventure and freedom. His yearning for escape and self-determination provides the emotional core of the narrative. Strang effectively uses Burke's character development to explore both personal maturation and the larger historical forces reshaping the Indian subcontinent. The provincial English setting provides sharp contrast to the exotic and perilous landscape of India that Burke eventually reaches.

## Historical Context and Adventure

As Burke pursues his ambitions in India, the novel situates him within the historical reality of Clive's campaigns and the consolidation of British power. Strang constructs an action-driven narrative that captures the excitement and danger of military adventure while maintaining connection to the historical record. The novel presents the military campaigns, political intrigue, and cultural encounters of the period through an engaging adventure narrative format. Burke's experiences allow readers to witness both the grand historical movements and the intimate human experiences of those involved in colonial conquest.

## Literary Approach and Themes

Strang's approach to historical fiction emphasizes the excitement and moral justification of imperial expansion while depicting the challenges and dangers faced by those pursuing such ambitions. The work reflects the heroic narrative tradition popular in early twentieth-century adventure literature. Themes of loyalty, courage, determination, and self-improvement animate Burke's character arc. While employing the conventions of imperial adventure fiction, Strang creates a compelling portrait of youth seeking identity and purpose within larger historical transformations.
