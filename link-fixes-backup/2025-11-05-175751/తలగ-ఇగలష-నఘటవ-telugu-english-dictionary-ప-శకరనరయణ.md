## Overview

P. Sankaranarayana's Telugu-English Dictionary, first published in 1900, represents a pivotal moment in the evolution of modern Telugu lexicography. This comprehensive reference work emerged during a critical period when Telugu linguistic scholarship was transitioning from traditional synonymic compilations to scientific, alphabetically-organized dictionaries based on European lexicographic principles. As both a scholarly resource and a practical tool for language learning, the dictionary has maintained its relevance for over a century, undergoing multiple editions and adaptations, including digital formats for contemporary word processing applications.

## The Telugu Lexicographic Tradition

The history of Telugu lexicography reveals a rich but initially non-alphabetic tradition. Traditional Telugu dictionaries, known as nighantuvu, were essentially collections of synonyms rather than comprehensive lexicons in the modern sense. These early works followed the philosophical frameworks of various religious schools and were arranged thematically rather than alphabetically, making them encyclopedic in character but less practical for quick reference when seeking precise word meanings. This approach reflected ancient Indian lexicographic practices that prioritized systematic cataloging of semantically related words over the alphabetical organization that would later become standard.

The watershed moment in Telugu lexicography arrived with the colonial encounter and the work of European scholars who brought scientific methodologies to Indian language study. The recognition of Dravidian languages as a distinct phylogenetic family separate from Indo-European languages dates to 1816, when F.W. Ellis, Collector of Madras, presented his findings at the College of Fort St. George. This linguistic classification provided the intellectual foundation for more systematic study of Telugu and its sister languages.

Among early Indian lexicographers, Mamidi Venkataraya's Andhra Deepika, completed in 1816, was the first Telugu dictionary produced by an Indian author to make a favorable impression on Western scholars. However, it was Charles Philip Brown who truly revolutionized Telugu lexicography and may be aptly described as the Father of the Renaissance in Telugu letters.

## C.P. Brown and the Modern Lexicographic Foundation

Charles Philip Brown (1798-1884), a British administrative officer working in Telugu-speaking regions, devoted his personal fortune and energy to Telugu linguistic scholarship. In 1820, Governor Thomas Munro of Madras had ordered that every official should learn a local language; Brown chose Telugu under the guidance of Velagapudi Kodandarama Panthulu. His commitment extended far beyond administrative necessity.

Brown's monumental contribution consisted of three dictionaries that marked the entry into the modern age in Telugu lexicography: the Telugu-English Dictionary (1852), the English-Telugu Dictionary (1853), and the Dictionary of Mixed Dialects and Foreign Words Used in Telugu (1854). These works represented a watershed between traditional rote learning and a scientific attitude toward language study. Brown collected thousands of palm-leaf manuscripts from remote corners of Telugu-speaking areas and employed approximately twenty pundits at his own expense to transcribe, index, and provide commentaries on these texts.

Brown's methodology proceeded on the scientific basis of European lexicography, shifting emphasis from mechanical listing of synonyms to lucid explanations that included literal meanings, etymology, usage patterns, grammatical information, syntax, and pronunciation where possible. His service to Telugu extended across multiple domains including grammar, prosody, and critical studies of classical Telugu literature, making his work epoch-making in its comprehensive scope.

## Sankaranarayana's Contribution and Methodology

P. Sankaranarayana (Paluri Sankaranarayana) built upon this foundation established by Brown and other pioneers. While Brown's Telugu-English Dictionary was re-edited in 1903 but not substantially revised thereafter, Sankaranarayana's work represented a new generation of Indian scholars continuing the lexicographic project. His English-Telugu dictionary was published in 1891 by K.R. Press, followed by the Telugu-English Dictionary in 1900, issued in Madras.

Sankaranarayana's medium-sized dictionary was published by Venkatarama & Co. in 1963, indicating the work's continued commercial viability. The dictionary's methodology reflected the scientific principles introduced by Brown while being compiled by a native Telugu scholar with intimate knowledge of the language's nuances, idiomatic expressions, and evolving usage patterns. This combination of scientific rigor and native linguistic intuition gave Sankaranarayana's work particular authority.

The dictionary provided comprehensive coverage of Telugu vocabulary with English equivalents, facilitating both language learning and translation work. It served the needs of European officers working under the Government of Madras, students of Telugu, and native speakers seeking to understand English terminology. The work's organization followed alphabetical principles using the Telugu script, making it accessible to those literate in Telugu while providing romanized transliterations for English readers.

## Language Preservation and Cultural Significance

Sankaranarayana's dictionary played a crucial role in language preservation during a period of significant linguistic change. The late 19th and early 20th centuries witnessed substantial English language influence on Telugu, particularly in areas under the Madras Presidency. Modern communication technologies and the printing press, introduced as effects of British rule, were transforming how Telugu was written, disseminated, and standardized.

Dictionaries serve as more than mere word lists; they function as authoritative arbiters of correct usage, spelling, and meaning. By documenting Telugu vocabulary comprehensively, Sankaranarayana's work helped stabilize the language during a period of rapid social and technological change. The dictionary preserved traditional vocabulary that might otherwise have been lost while also incorporating new terminology necessitated by modern administration, education, and technology.

The work also facilitated the continued literary production in Telugu by providing writers, translators, and scholars with a reliable reference tool. This was particularly important for the renaissance in Telugu literature that was occurring during this period, as authors sought to create works that drew on classical Telugu traditions while engaging with contemporary themes and modern literary forms.

## Colonial-Era Linguistic Work and Power Dynamics

The production of dictionaries during the colonial era cannot be separated from the broader political and cultural context of British rule in India. Language documentation was intimately connected to administrative control, missionary activity, and the colonial project of cataloging and governing diverse populations. Governor Munro's 1820 order requiring officials to learn local languages reflected the practical necessity of governance, not merely academic curiosity.

However, the lexicographic work produced during this era had contradictory effects. While serving colonial administrative needs, dictionaries also empowered indigenous scholars and facilitated the preservation and modernization of Indian languages. Brown's massive investment in collecting manuscripts and employing Telugu pundits created employment and elevated the status of Telugu scholarship. His publication of classical texts with commentaries made Telugu literature more accessible and helped spark renewed interest in the classical tradition.

Indian lexicographers like Sankaranarayana occupied a complex position, working within frameworks established by colonial scholars while asserting indigenous linguistic authority. The shift from European-dominated lexicography to Indian-authored dictionaries represented a form of intellectual decolonization, even as the methodologies employed remained influenced by European scientific approaches.

Later works continued this tradition: C. Ranganayakulu Chetti published the Andhra Deepika in 1895, and the Lakshmi Narayaneeyam appeared in 1907, later expanded into the comprehensive four-volume Andhra Vachaspatyam. This proliferation of dictionaries by Indian scholars demonstrated the vitality of Telugu linguistic scholarship and the community's commitment to language preservation and development.

## Modern Usage and Contemporary Relevance

Sankaranarayana's dictionary has demonstrated remarkable longevity, remaining in print and use well into the 21st century. The seventh edition was published in 2021 by S.R. Book Links, containing 1,704 pages and marketed through online retailers, demonstrating continued commercial demand. This sustained publication history, spanning over 120 years, testifies to the work's fundamental soundness and ongoing utility.

The dictionary has also been adapted for the digital age. Electronic texts of both Sankaranarayana's Telugu-English and English-Telugu dictionaries were prepared for use in word processing software, enabling contemporary users to access this historical resource through modern technologies. This digitization ensures the dictionary remains relevant for new generations who expect instant digital access to reference materials.

However, scholars have noted that while later editions have appeared, the dictionary has not been effectively modernized to incorporate contemporary vocabulary, technological terminology, and evolving usage patterns. This presents both a limitation and an opportunity: the dictionary preserves historical usage patterns and traditional vocabulary that might be lost in more aggressively updated works, while simultaneously showing its age when consulted for contemporary terminology.

The dictionary continues to serve multiple audiences: students learning Telugu, scholars researching historical Telugu usage, translators working between Telugu and English, and native Telugu speakers seeking to understand the evolution of their language. It functions as both a practical reference tool and a historical document, capturing Telugu vocabulary and usage patterns from the turn of the 20th century.

## Lexicographic Legacy and Scholarly Assessment

Sankaranarayana's Telugu-English Dictionary occupies an important but not preeminent position in the history of Telugu lexicography. While lacking the revolutionary impact of C.P. Brown's pioneering works or the comprehensive scope of later multi-volume projects like the Andhra Vachaspatyam, it represents solid, sustained lexicographic work by an Indian scholar during a critical period in Telugu language development.

The dictionary's methodology, drawing on European scientific principles while compiled by a native speaker, exemplifies the productive synthesis of colonial-era linguistic scholarship. It demonstrates how Indian scholars adopted and adapted Western lexicographic techniques to serve the needs of their own linguistic communities, creating reference works that outlasted the colonial administration that partly inspired them.

In the broader context of Dravidian linguistics, Telugu dictionaries like Sankaranarayana's contributed to the scholarly understanding of the Dravidian language family's structure, vocabulary, and relationships. They provided essential data for comparative linguistic research and helped establish Telugu's position as a major literary language with a sophisticated lexical tradition.

The work also illustrates the crucial role of commercial publishing houses in sustaining linguistic scholarship. The involvement of publishers like K.R. Press, Venkatarama & Co., and later S.R. Book Links ensured that the dictionary remained available across multiple generations, demonstrating that scholarly lexicography could also be economically viable.

## Conclusion

P. Sankaranarayana's Telugu-English Dictionary, first published in 1900, represents a significant achievement in Indian lexicography and an important contribution to Telugu language preservation. Emerging from the rich tradition of Telugu linguistic scholarship that was transformed by colonial-era contact with European scientific methodologies, the dictionary synthesizes traditional knowledge with modern organizational principles. Its sustained publication over more than a century, adaptation to digital formats, and continued use by diverse audiences testify to its fundamental soundness and enduring value. While scholarly attention has focused more on pioneering works by C.P. Brown and later comprehensive projects, Sankaranarayana's dictionary deserves recognition as a reliable, accessible reference work that has served multiple generations of Telugu speakers, learners, and scholars. It stands as both a practical tool and a historical document, preserving a snapshot of Telugu vocabulary and usage at the turn of the 20th century while continuing to facilitate language learning and cross-linguistic understanding in the contemporary era.
