# The Viṣṇudharmottara Purāṇa (Part III)

## Overview

Part III of the Viṣṇudharmottara Purāṇa, translated by renowned art historian Stella Kramrisch (1928), is one of ancient India's earliest and most authoritative technical treatises on painting (chitra-vidya) and image-making (pratima-lakshana). This section contains detailed chitrasutras (aphorisms on painting) that established foundational principles for Indian pictorial arts.

The text systematically covers pramana (proportional measurement systems for figures), techniques of brush work and line drawing, preparation and application of colors (including mineral and vegetable pigments), composition principles governing spatial arrangement, and detailed iconographic lakshanas specifying how deities should be depicted (postures, attributes, colors, ornaments). These technical specifications influenced subsequent painting traditions across India, from manuscript illumination to temple murals to miniature painting schools. Stella Kramrisch's translation made this foundational text accessible to modern scholars. Essential for understanding the theoretical and technical basis of Indian painting beyond stylistic analysis. Available through Archive.org, public domain.

## Composition and Dating

The Viṣṇudharmottara Purāṇa emerged during a pivotal period in Indian aesthetic theory. While scholarly opinions vary regarding precise dating, the consensus places the text's compilation between the 5th and 7th centuries CE, with the third khaṇḍa (book) most likely complete by the 6th century CE. Stella Kramrisch argued that while the earlier Viṣṇu Purāṇa cannot be earlier than the latter half of the 4th century CE, the chapters specifically addressing painting theory in the Viṣṇudharmottara were compiled during the 7th century. David Pingree suggests the surviving recension dates to the 5th or 6th century. This chronology situates the text during or shortly after the Gupta period (c. 320-550 CE), an era renowned as the classical age of Indian art, when aesthetic principles attained systematic codification.

The text presents itself as dialogue between the sage Mārkaṇḍeya and King Vajra, who seeks instruction in image-making. Significantly, Mārkaṇḍeya establishes a pedagogical hierarchy, asserting that one must first master dance before sculpture, music before dance, and painting before music. This progression reveals the Viṣṇudharmottara's understanding of painting as foundational to all visual and performing arts. The Citrasutra proper comprises chapters 35-43 of the third khaṇḍa, followed by chapters 44-85 on Pratimālakṣaṇa (iconographic specifications for sculpture). This structure reflects the text's comprehensive approach to visual representation, treating painting and sculpture as interconnected disciplines governed by unified aesthetic principles.

## Painting Theory and the Ṣaḍaṅga (Six Limbs)

The Viṣṇudharmottara's most enduring contribution to art theory is its articulation of the Ṣaḍaṅga or Six Limbs of Painting, principles that became canonical for Indian pictorial arts. The famous Sanskrit śloka enumerates these limbs: "Rūpabhedaḥ pramāṇāni bhāva-lāvanya-yojanam / Sadṛśyaṃ varṇikābhaṅgam iti citraṃ ṣaḍaṅgakam." These six elements are:

**Rūpabheda** (Form and Differentiation): Knowledge of distinctive forms, enabling the artist to differentiate types and variations within categories of beings and objects. This involves understanding anatomical structures, characteristic features of various classes of subjects, and the principles governing formal distinctions.

**Pramāṇa** (Proportion and Measurement): The systematic science of proportions governing the human figure and other subjects. The text elaborates the tālamāna system, where one tāla equals twelve aṅgulas (finger-breadths), providing mathematical ratios for rendering figures of different types—deities, humans of various classes, animals, and architectural elements. This iconometric system ensured consistency and appropriateness in representation.

**Bhāva** (Emotional Disposition): The capacity to infuse painted figures with psychological states and emotional expressions. Bhāva brings artwork to life, enabling viewers to perceive the inner states of depicted subjects. This principle connects the Citrasutra to rasā theory from the Nāṭyaśāstra, extending aesthetic emotionalism from drama to visual arts.

**Lāvanya-yojana** (Infusion of Grace and Beauty): The aesthetic quality that transcends mere technical accuracy, imparting harmony, elegance, and refined beauty to composition. This principle addresses the ineffable qualities that distinguish accomplished art from mechanical rendering.

**Sadṛśya** (Verisimilitude): The requirement that paintings bear credible resemblance to their subjects, reflecting observable reality while accommodating idealization appropriate to the subject's nature. This concept balances naturalism with conventional representation.

**Varṇikābhaṅga** (Color Differentiation and Application): Technical knowledge of pigments, their preparation, appropriate color choices for different subjects and contexts, and methods of application including layering and shading. The text provides extensive instructions on mineral and vegetable pigments, binding agents, and techniques for achieving depth and three-dimensionality through color modulation.

The Viṣṇudharmottara is the earliest extant text to elaborate rasa theory specifically for visual arts. While the Nāṭyaśāstra identified eight rasas (aesthetic emotions), the Viṣṁudharmottara accepts and introduces śānta (tranquility) as a ninth rasa, prefiguring later developments in aesthetic philosophy. The text thus establishes painting as a rasa-producing art capable of evoking complex aesthetic experiences comparable to those produced by poetry and drama.

Beyond these theoretical principles, the Citrasutra provides practical instruction on technical processes: preparing surfaces (walls, cloth, wood) for painting; manufacturing brushes; grinding and preparing mineral pigments (including ochres, lapis lazuli, malachite) and organic colorants; binding agents; techniques of line drawing (rekhā); methods of shading (vartanā) to create three-dimensional effects; and principles governing compositional arrangement. The text addresses both religious and secular subject matter, detailing appropriate treatments for depicting deities, kings, ascetics, women of various classes, animals, landscapes, and architectural settings.

## Iconography and Pratimālakṣaṇa

Following the Citrasutra, chapters 44-85 constitute an extensive manual of Pratimālakṣaṇa—the iconographic specifications governing image-making for religious sculpture. These chapters provide precise prescriptions for depicting deities: appropriate postures (āsanas), hand gestures (mudrās), attributes and implements, ornaments and garments, vehicle animals (vāhanas), attendant figures, and iconographic details that distinguish each deity. The text specifies proper colors, complexions, numbers of arms, and symbolic elements that must be incorporated to render images suitable for worship.

The iconometric system (tālamāna) described for painting extends to sculpture with even greater elaboration. The text prescribes proportional systems for images of different types: uttama (superior/divine figures measuring 124 aṅgulas or more), madhyama (intermediate figures of 120 aṅgulas), and adhama (lesser figures of 116 aṅgulas or fewer). Within each category, precise measurements govern the relationships between head, torso, limbs, and features, ensuring that sculptural images conform to theological and aesthetic requirements.

This integration of painting theory with sculptural iconography reveals the Viṣṇudharmottara's comprehensive vision of the visual arts. The text treats painting, sculpture, architecture, music, and dance as interconnected disciplines governed by analogous principles of proportion, formal differentiation, emotional expression, and adherence to scriptural authority. This systematic approach established a theoretical foundation that would inform Indian art production for centuries.

## Stella Kramrisch and the 1928 Edition

Stella Kramrisch (1896-1993) was a pioneering art historian whose scholarship fundamentally shaped 20th-century understanding of Indian art. Born in Austria, she completed her doctorate at the University of Vienna in 1919 before traveling to India in 1922. In 1923, she joined the University of Calcutta as its first professor of Indian art, a position she held until 1950. During this period, she produced groundbreaking publications including Principles of Indian Art (1924), Indian Sculpture (1933), A Survey of Painting in the Deccan (1937), and her monumental two-volume study The Hindu Temple (1946), which remains a foundational text in the field.

Kramrisch's translation of the Viṣṇudharmottara Part III, published by Calcutta University Press in 1928, was the first English rendering of the Citrasutra, making this crucial text accessible to international scholarship. Her edition includes the Sanskrit text, English translation, and an extensive introduction situating the work within the broader context of Indian aesthetic theory and surviving artistic evidence, particularly the Ajanta murals, which she understood as exemplifying the principles enumerated in the text.

As an act of pioneering scholarship, Kramrisch's translation opened the Citrasutra to art historical research at a formative moment in the discipline. However, subsequent scholars have noted limitations in her edition. Her Sanskrit text was based on a problematic manuscript tradition, and scholars acknowledge that Kramrisch, whose primary training was in art history rather than Indology, relied on assistance from others for philological aspects of the translation. Consequently, certain passages are inaccurately rendered or inadequately explained. Despite these limitations, Kramrisch's introduction remains valuable for its perceptive observations on the text's dating, its relationship to contemporary artistic production (especially Ajanta), and its general characteristics as an aesthetic treatise.

Kramrisch's broader scholarly legacy established methodologies for studying Indian art that integrated textual sources with visual evidence, theological context with formal analysis, and historical development with enduring aesthetic principles. Her work on the Viṣṇudharmottara exemplifies this approach, reading the Citrasutra alongside surviving paintings and sculptures to illuminate both text and artifacts. Though more recent translations by scholars including C. Sivaramamurti, Priyabala Shah, and others have superseded Kramrisch's rendering philologically, her edition retains historical significance as the work that introduced the Citrasutra to global art historical discourse.

## Significance for Indian Art History

The Viṣṇudharmottara Purāṇa occupies a position of singular importance in the study of Indian art history. As the earliest surviving comprehensive treatise on painting theory, it provides documentary evidence for aesthetic principles and technical practices that might otherwise be inferred only from visual artifacts. The text demonstrates that by the 6th century CE, Indian artists and theorists had developed sophisticated conceptual frameworks for understanding pictorial art—frameworks that recognized painting as an intellectually rigorous discipline requiring mastery of proportion, anatomy, color theory, emotional expression, and philosophical principles.

The Ṣaḍaṅga principles articulated in the Citrasutra became canonical, referenced and elaborated in subsequent texts and transmitted across regional and temporal boundaries. The emphasis on bhāva and the application of rasa theory to visual arts established a distinctly Indian approach to painting, one that prioritized emotional and spiritual content alongside formal considerations. This aesthetic philosophy distinguishes Indian painting traditions from those governed primarily by naturalistic representation or decorative concerns.

The text's influence on actual artistic practice is evidenced across the spectrum of Indian painting traditions. The Ajanta cave murals (5th-6th centuries CE), roughly contemporary with the Viṣṇudharmottara, demonstrate the principles the text codifies: sophisticated use of line, shading techniques that create volumetric effects, attention to emotional expression, and adherence to iconographic conventions. Later traditions—including manuscript illuminations, Pāla-Sena paintings, Jain book illustrations, Deccani murals, and the Rājput and Mughal miniature schools—all reflect the fundamental principles established in the Citrasutra, even as they develop distinctive regional styles and respond to new cultural contexts.

The integration of painting theory with iconographic prescription reveals the religious and social functions of visual arts in ancient India. The Viṣṇudharmottara was not merely an artists' manual but a śāstric text, endowing image-making with scriptural authority and integrating artistic practice into the broader system of dharmic knowledge. This elevated status helps explain the sophisticated development of Indian painting traditions and the continuity of their fundamental principles across centuries.

For contemporary art history, the Viṣṇudharmottara provides an essential corrective to approaches that analyze Indian art solely through formal or stylistic lenses. The text reveals the conceptual, philosophical, and technical considerations that informed artistic production, enabling scholars to interpret paintings and sculptures within the aesthetic frameworks their creators employed. It demonstrates that Indian artists worked within elaborate theoretical systems comparable in sophistication to the aesthetic philosophies developed for literature, music, and drama.

The Viṣṇudharmottara also illuminates the relationship between textual prescription and artistic innovation. While the text establishes normative principles, surviving artworks demonstrate that artists exercised creative agency within these frameworks, adapting canonical principles to specific contexts, patronage demands, regional aesthetics, and individual vision. Understanding this dynamic relationship between śāstric authority and artistic practice remains crucial for nuanced interpretation of Indian visual culture.

Kramrisch's translation, despite its limitations, catalyzed this interpretive project by making the Citrasutra accessible to international scholarship. Her work enabled generations of scholars to approach Indian painting with awareness of its indigenous theoretical foundations, moving beyond purely formal analysis or comparisons with Western art historical paradigms. The ongoing engagement with the Viṣṇudharmottara in contemporary scholarship—through improved translations, detailed commentaries, and comparative studies with visual evidence—testifies to the text's enduring relevance for understanding one of the world's great painting traditions.
