  This regimental history traces the 3rd Battalion, 1st Punjab Regiment's lineage from its origins as the 16th Madras Native Infantry (1759) through its redesignation as 76th Punjabis and eventual incorporation into the reorganized Punjab Regiment following the Kitchener reforms (1903). Regimental histories constitute a distinctive genre of military historiography, combining official chronology of campaigns and reorganizations with narratives designed to instill esprit de corps, commemorate fallen soldiers, and establish institutional identity across generational change. This work documents the unit's transformation from Madras Presidency army sepoy battalion to Punjabi-recruited infantry regiment, reflecting broader shifts in British Indian Army recruitment policy following the 1857 Rebellion, when British authorities systematically privileged northern "martial races" while reducing reliance on Bengal and Madras Presidency troops. The history chronicles the battalion's service across the expanding frontiers of British India—Burma campaigns, Afghan Wars, frontier expeditions—providing detailed accounts of battles, commanders, and regimental traditions that constituted corporate memory and military culture. Such histories served crucial ideological functions: they naturalized British command while celebrating Indian soldiers' loyalty, transforming coerced imperial military service into narratives of martial honor and regimental tradition. The text documents the complex processes through which diverse recruits—drawn from specific communities through targeted recruitment in particular villages and kin networks—were forged into military units with corporate identities transcending ethnic and religious affiliations through shared experience, ritual, and regimental ceremony. As historical source, regimental histories require critical reading that recognizes their function as institutional mythology while mining them for valuable data on recruitment patterns, caste and community composition, campaign details, and the symbolic systems through which colonial armies constructed loyalty and discipline. This particular work illuminates the Punjab Regiment's central role in British Indian military power while documenting the human experiences of soldiers whose service sustained empire.
