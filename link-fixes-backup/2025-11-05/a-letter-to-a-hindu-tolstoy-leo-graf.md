# A Letter to a Hindu

## Overview

*A Letter to a Hindu* (1908) represents Leo Tolstoy's direct intervention in the discourse surrounding Indian resistance to British colonial rule. Written as an open letter to Tarak Nath Das, editor of the revolutionary journal *Free Hindustan*, the essay articulates Tolstoy's philosophy of nonviolent resistance and critiques both violent revolutionary methods and passive acceptance of oppression. The letter synthesizes Tolstoy's Christian anarchist convictions with his interpretation of Hindu religious texts, particularly the Vedas and the teachings of Krishna, to argue that spiritual-moral transformation rather than political violence offers the authentic path to liberation.

The historical significance of this brief work far exceeds its length. Upon reading Tolstoy's letter, Mohandas Gandhi—then a young lawyer in South Africa developing his own theories of resistance—initiated correspondence with Tolstoy in 1909. Their exchange, though brief (Tolstoy died in 1910), profoundly influenced Gandhi's formulation of satyagraha (truth-force) and provided philosophical legitimacy to nonviolent resistance from a revered Western intellectual. The letter thus occupies a crucial position in the intellectual genealogy of the Indian independence movement.

Tolstoy's intervention also exemplifies late 19th/early 20th century transnational anti-colonial discourse, demonstrating how revolutionary ideas circulated globally and how Western anarchist philosophy intersected with Asian anti-imperial movements.

## The Author: Leo Tolstoy and His Late Philosophy

By 1908, Count Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy (1828-1910) had long abandoned the literary career that produced *War and Peace* (1869) and *Anna Karenina* (1877), devoting himself instead to religious, philosophical, and social critique. Following his spiritual crisis in the late 1870s, documented in *A Confession* (1882), Tolstoy developed a radical Christian anarchist philosophy that rejected state authority, institutionalized religion, private property, and violence in all forms.

### Tolstoy's Philosophy of Nonresistance

Central to Tolstoy's late thought was the principle of nonresistance to evil by violence, derived from his idiosyncratic reading of Christ's Sermon on the Mount. Tolstoy interpreted "resist not evil" (Matthew 5:39) as an absolute prohibition on violent opposition to injustice. This did not mean passive acceptance—rather, Tolstoy advocated active non-cooperation with evil institutions and personal transformation according to the law of love.

Key elements of Tolstoy's philosophy relevant to the letter include:

**Christian Anarchism**: Rejection of all state authority as inherently violent and contrary to Christian teaching
**Non-cooperation**: Refusal to participate in governmental, military, or judicial institutions
**Universal Love**: Identification of love as the supreme law governing human existence
**Individual Transformation**: Belief that social change must begin with individual spiritual-moral regeneration
**Critique of Modern Civilization**: Condemnation of industrial capitalism, nationalism, and Western "progress"

### Tolstoy and Eastern Philosophy

Though Tolstoy was Christian in orientation, he demonstrated sustained interest in Eastern religious traditions, particularly Buddhism and Hinduism. He studied the Vedas, Upanishads, and Bhagavad Gita, finding in them support for his own ethical convictions. Tolstoy practiced a somewhat uncritical syncretism, reading Hindu texts through his Christian anarchist lens and claiming universal agreement among world religions on fundamental ethical principles.

This approach, while philosophically naive, enabled Tolstoy to address Hindu readers by citing their own scriptures and arguing that true adherence to Hindu teachings necessitated nonviolent resistance to British oppression.

## Historical Context: Indian Independence Movement Circa 1908

Tolstoy wrote his letter at a pivotal moment in the Indian independence struggle:

### The Rise of Revolutionary Nationalism

By 1908, the Indian National Congress's moderate approach of petitioning for gradual reforms had frustrated younger nationalists. Revolutionary groups emerged advocating armed resistance, political assassination, and violent uprising. Notable events included:

**Partition of Bengal (1905)**: British division of Bengal along religious lines sparked massive protests and the growth of revolutionary organizations
**Revolutionary Terrorism**: Groups like Anushilan Samiti and Jugantar conducted bombings and assassinations of British officials
**Alipore Bomb Case (1908)**: Prosecution of revolutionary leaders including Aurobindo Ghose brought revolutionary methods into public debate

### Tarak Nath Das and *Free Hindustan*

Tarak Nath Das (1884-1958) was a Bengali revolutionary who fled India to avoid arrest, eventually settling in the United States. He edited *Free Hindustan*, a journal advocating Indian independence through revolutionary means. Das represented a generation of educated, radicalized young Indians who rejected the Congress's constitutional methods as ineffective.

Tolstoy's letter responded to *Free Hindustan*'s advocacy of violent resistance, offering an alternative philosophy that acknowledged the justice of Indian anti-colonial struggle while rejecting revolutionary violence.

### Gandhi in South Africa

In 1908, Mohandas Gandhi (1869-1948) was living in South Africa, leading the Indian community's resistance to discriminatory laws through methods he was beginning to term satyagraha. Gandhi had read Tolstoy's *The Kingdom of God Is Within You* (1894) and found it "overwhelming" in its influence. When Gandhi encountered *A Letter to a Hindu* in 1909, he immediately wrote to Tolstoy, beginning correspondence that Gandhi later described as profoundly formative.

## Content and Arguments

Tolstoy's letter advances several interconnected arguments:

### The Diagnosis: Moral-Spiritual Degradation

Tolstoy rejects the standard nationalist explanation that Indian subjugation results from British military superiority or Indian political weakness. Instead, he argues that the fundamental problem is spiritual: Indians have lost authentic connection to their religious traditions and the universal law of love these traditions teach.

He cites the paradox of colonial rule—that "two hundred million" Indians remain subjugated by a handful of British because Indians themselves enforce British rule through participation in colonial administration, military, and economy. The oppressor's power derives from the oppressed's cooperation.

### The Prescription: Adherence to the Law of Love

Tolstoy argues that liberation requires Indians to recognize and follow what he terms the "law of love"—the fundamental principle he claims is taught by all religions, including Hinduism. He cites Krishna's teachings from the Bhagavad Gita and Vedic texts to demonstrate that Hindu tradition supports nonviolent love over violent resistance.

Crucially, Tolstoy insists that following this law means refusing to participate in institutions based on violence: the military, police, courts, and government administration. By withdrawing cooperation, Indians would render British rule impossible without British needing to be violently expelled.

### Critique of Violence and Revolutionary Methods

Tolstoy explicitly rejects revolutionary terrorism and violent resistance as morally wrong and practically ineffective. Violence, he argues, legitimizes the oppressor's violence and perpetuates the cycle of coercion. Moreover, violent revolution merely replaces one coercive government with another, leaving intact the fundamental problem: organized violence as the basis of social order.

### Individual Transformation as Social Change

Consistent with his anarchist philosophy, Tolstoy locates revolutionary agency in individual moral transformation rather than collective political action. He argues that if individuals refuse to cooperate with evil, oppressive institutions will collapse from within. This highly individualistic approach reflects Tolstoy's distrust of political organizations and collective movements.

## Influence on Gandhi and Satyagraha

The letter's most significant impact was on Gandhi's development of satyagraha philosophy:

### The Tolstoy-Gandhi Correspondence

Upon reading *A Letter to a Hindu*, Gandhi reprinted it in his South African journal *Indian Opinion* and wrote to Tolstoy in October 1909. Tolstoy replied warmly, and they exchanged several letters until Tolstoy's death in November 1910. In their correspondence, Tolstoy encouraged Gandhi's nonviolent methods and reinforced Gandhi's conviction that mass nonviolent non-cooperation could defeat British imperialism.

### Satyagraha's Debt to Tolstoy

While Gandhi developed satyagraha independently from multiple sources (Bhagavad Gita, Jain ahimsa, Ruskin's social thought), Tolstoy's influence was crucial in several ways:

**Philosophical Legitimation**: Tolstoy provided Western intellectual authority for nonviolent resistance, useful when Gandhi faced skeptics who dismissed nonviolence as weakness or impractical idealism
**Christian-Hindu Synthesis**: Tolstoy's demonstration that Christian and Hindu teachings converge on nonviolence supported Gandhi's own universalist religious philosophy
**Non-cooperation Strategy**: Tolstoy's emphasis on withdrawing cooperation from unjust institutions directly informed Gandhi's non-cooperation campaigns (1920-22, 1930-32)
**Moral-Spiritual Framework**: Tolstoy reinforced Gandhi's understanding of political struggle as ultimately spiritual-moral rather than merely tactical

### Differences Between Tolstoy and Gandhi

Despite profound influence, important differences existed:

**Religious Foundation**: Tolstoy's framework was fundamentally Christian anarchist; Gandhi's was rooted in Hindu-Jain philosophy with Christian influences
**Political Pragmatism**: Gandhi proved more politically pragmatic than Tolstoy, willing to engage with political institutions and make strategic compromises
**Constructive Program**: Gandhi developed "constructive program" (village industries, education, communal harmony) alongside resistance; Tolstoy focused more exclusively on non-cooperation
**Theory of State**: Gandhi eventually accepted democratic state structures as potentially legitimate; Tolstoy rejected all state authority absolutely

## Critique and Limitations

Modern scholars and historical actors have identified several limitations in Tolstoy's analysis:

### Inadequate Political Analysis

Tolstoy's moral-spiritual diagnosis largely ignores concrete political-economic factors in colonial domination: military occupation, economic exploitation, deliberate underdevelopment, and systematic racial discrimination. His claim that Indians are subjugated primarily because of their own moral failings can appear as blaming the victim.

### Naive About Power

Tolstoy's faith that individual moral transformation and non-cooperation would inevitably topple unjust power underestimates the coercive capacity of determined governments. British rule in India did not simply collapse when many Indians practiced non-cooperation; it required decades of sustained struggle, international pressure, and ultimately British exhaustion from World War II.

### Cultural Appropriation and Misreading

Tolstoy's interpretation of Hindu texts served his pre-existing philosophical commitments. His reading of the Bhagavad Gita as advocating nonviolence contradicts the text's actual context—Krishna counseling Arjuna to fight. While Tolstoy's misreading proved historically productive (influencing Gandhi's similarly creative interpretation), it reflects colonial-era Western intellectuals' tendency to remake Eastern traditions in their own image.

### Inadequate Response to Revolutionary Arguments

Revolutionaries like Das argued that British imperialism was an intrinsically violent system that could only be overthrown through counter-violence. Tolstoy's moral arguments did not meaningfully engage the question of whether nonviolence could actually succeed against a determined imperial power—a question that remained contested throughout India's independence struggle.

## Legacy and Contemporary Relevance

Despite its limitations, *A Letter to a Hindu* occupies important positions in multiple historical contexts:

### Intellectual History of Nonviolent Resistance

The letter represents a crucial node in the global circulation of nonviolent resistance philosophy. The lineage runs from Tolstoy's Christian anarchism through Gandhi's satyagraha to Martin Luther King Jr.'s civil rights movement, with Tolstoy's letter as a key transmission point.

### Transnational Anti-Colonial Discourse

The text exemplifies how anti-colonial movements drew on transnational intellectual networks, adapting ideas across cultural contexts. Tolstoy (Russian), Das (Bengali), and Gandhi (Gujarati) engaged in philosophical dialogue that transcended national boundaries, demonstrating the global character of anti-imperial thought.

### Religious Universalism and Comparative Ethics

Tolstoy's attempt to demonstrate convergence between Christian and Hindu ethics on nonviolence—however philosophically crude—anticipated later interfaith dialogue and comparative religious ethics. His approach influenced later thinkers seeking common ground across religious traditions.

### Continuing Debates on Violence and Social Change

The fundamental question Tolstoy addressed—whether violent or nonviolent resistance more effectively challenges oppression—remains contested in contemporary liberation movements. Debates over Black Lives Matter tactics, Palestinian resistance, and climate activism revisit Tolstoy's arguments about the efficacy and morality of violence versus nonviolence.

## Textual History and Availability

Originally published in Russian in 1908, the letter was quickly translated into English and other languages, circulated widely through Gandhi's reprinting in *Indian Opinion* and subsequent dissemination by independence activists. Its brevity made it ideal for leaflet distribution, though British authorities occasionally banned its circulation in India as seditious literature.

The text's availability through Project Gutenberg ensures its accessibility for contemporary readers interested in the intellectual foundations of nonviolent resistance, the Gandhi-Tolstoy relationship, and the transnational dimensions of anti-colonial thought.
