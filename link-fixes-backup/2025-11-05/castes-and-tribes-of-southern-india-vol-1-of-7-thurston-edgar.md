description: 'Castes and Tribes of Southern India represents one of the most ambitious

  seven-volume encyclopedia documenting over 300 castes and tribes across the Madras
  Presidency and the princely states of Travancore, Mysore, Coorg, and Pudukkottai.
  Published by the Government Press, Madras in 1909, this extraordinary work was authored
  by Edgar Thurston (1855-1935), British Superintendent of the Madras Government Museum,
  assisted by his colleague K. Rangachari. Volume 1, covering 539 pages and addressing
  castes and tribes from A to B, inaugurates this encyclopedic documentation of southern
  Indian social groups representing more than 40 million individuals across an area
  exceeding 150,000 square miles. Thurston''s work emerged from his appointment in
  1901 to the Ethnographic Survey of India, modeled on Herbert Hope Risley''s successful
  Ethnographic Survey of Bengal. The project built on Thurston''s earlier ethnographic
  research on the hill tribes of the Nilgiri District, published in 1894, expanding
  it to encompass the entire Madras Presidency with unprecedented scope and detail.
  Each entry in the volumes provides systematic documentation of physical characteristics,
  customs, religious practices, marriage ceremonies, funeral rites, social organization,
  occupational traditions, folklore, and material culture. Thurston conducted extensive
  anthropometric measurements, photographed subjects, collected artifacts, and recorded
  oral traditions, facing considerable challenges including local superstitions and
  fears about his scientific methods. The contemporary reception recognized the work''s
  significance; Nature journal''s September 1910 edition described the publication
  as ''a monumental record of the varied phases of south Indian tribal life, the traditions,
  manners and customs of people.'' The work reflects both the strengths and limitations
  of early twentieth-century colonial ethnography—its meticulous documentation preserved
  invaluable information about communities undergoing rapid social transformation,
  yet its classificatory schemes and interpretive frameworks bear the marks of their
  colonial context and now-outdated anthropological theories. Thurston explicitly
  stated his motivation: to record traditional ways of life before modernization erased
  them forever, a prescient concern given the dramatic social changes southern India
  would undergo through the twentieth century. The volumes include extensive photography,
  detailed illustrations of material culture, genealogical tables, and numerous appendices
  with supplementary data. For contemporary scholars, these volumes remain an irreplaceable
  primary source for understanding southern Indian social history, despite requiring
  critical engagement with their colonial perspectives. The work documents languages,
  dialects, kinship systems, economic activities, religious beliefs, and social structures
  with a comprehensiveness never again attempted. Researchers in anthropology, sociology,
  history, linguistics, and folklore studies continue to mine these volumes for data
  unavailable elsewhere. The encyclopedic format allows readers to trace specific
  communities across the work or to understand the broader patterns of southern Indian
  social organization.'

# Castes and Tribes of Southern India, Volume 1 of 7

## Overview

Castes and Tribes of Southern India represents one of the most ambitious and comprehensive ethnographic surveys ever undertaken in colonial India, a monumental seven-volume encyclopedia documenting over 300 castes and tribes across the Madras Presidency and the princely states of Travancore, Mysore, Coorg, and Pudukkottai. Published by the Government Press, Madras in 1909, this extraordinary work was authored by Edgar Thurston (1855-1935), British Superintendent of the Madras Government Museum from 1885 to 1908, assisted by his colleague K. Rangachari, M.A., from the Madras Museum.

Volume 1, covering 539 pages and addressing castes and tribes from A to B, inaugurates this encyclopedic documentation of southern Indian social groups representing more than 40 million individuals across an area exceeding 150,000 square miles. Thurston's work emerged from his appointment in 1901 to the Ethnographic Survey of India, modeled on Herbert Hope Risley's successful Ethnographic Survey of Bengal. The project built on Thurston's earlier ethnographic research on the hill tribes of the Nilgiri District, published in 1894, expanding it to encompass the entire Madras Presidency with unprecedented scope and detail.

The task Thurston undertook was staggering: to record the 'manners and customs' and physical characters of more than 300 castes and tribes, each with distinct social practices, religious beliefs, and cultural traditions. Each entry in the volumes provides systematic documentation of physical characteristics, customs, religious practices, marriage ceremonies, funeral rites, social organization, occupational traditions, folklore, and material culture. Thurston conducted extensive anthropometric measurements, photographed subjects, collected artifacts, and recorded oral traditions, facing considerable challenges including local superstitions and fears about his scientific methods.

The contemporary reception recognized the work's significance; Nature journal's September 1910 edition described the publication as 'a monumental record of the varied phases of south Indian tribal life, the traditions, manners and customs of people.' The work reflects both the strengths and limitations of early twentieth-century colonial ethnography—its meticulous documentation preserved invaluable information about communities undergoing rapid social transformation, yet its classificatory schemes and interpretive frameworks bear the marks of their colonial context and now-outdated anthropological theories.

Thurston explicitly stated his motivation in the volume's preface: to record traditional ways of life before modernization erased them forever, a prescient concern given the dramatic social changes southern India would undergo through the twentieth century. He reflected on the challenges of the anthropometric investigation, including the superstitions and fears of local populations regarding his measurements and methods, and explained the significance of various cultural practices and the pressing need to record these traditions before they were lost to modern influences.

The volumes include extensive photography, detailed illustrations of material culture, genealogical tables, and numerous appendices with supplementary data. For contemporary scholars, these volumes remain an irreplaceable primary source for understanding southern Indian social history, despite requiring critical engagement with their colonial perspectives. The work documents languages, dialects, kinship systems, economic activities, religious beliefs, and social structures with a comprehensiveness never again attempted.

Researchers in anthropology, sociology, history, linguistics, and folklore studies continue to mine these volumes for data unavailable elsewhere. The encyclopedic format allows readers to trace specific communities across the work or to understand the broader patterns of southern Indian social organization. While modern scholarship has superseded many of Thurston's interpretations, the raw ethnographic data he and Rangachari preserved remains invaluable for reconstructing southern Indian social history at the turn of the twentieth century.

This work is in the public domain and represents a landmark in Indian ethnography and anthropology. Despite its colonial context, it remains an essential resource for understanding the social diversity and cultural richness of southern India at a crucial moment of historical transition.
