description: '"Rujub, the Juggler" by G. A. Henty is a historical novel aimed at young
  adults and older readers, written during the late 19th century. The story is set
  against the backdrop of the Sepoy Mutiny in India between 1857 and 1859, focusing
  on the conflict between British colonial forces and Indian soldiers. The central
  character, Ralph Bathurst, is portrayed as a soldier who grapples with his fears
  and insecurities in the face of war, while Rujub, the titular juggler, serves as
  a mysterious and skilled ally in his journey.  At the start of the narrative, readers
  are introduced to a festive scene at the Rajah''s palace amid colorful lanterns
  and music, symbolizing a superficial peace before the coming turmoil. The Rajah
  entertains British officers, masking his underlying schemes against them while plotting
  with his allies to incite the Sepoy rebellion. Ralph Bathurst, on the other hand,
  is depicted as a natural coward who strives to prove his bravery. The opening chapters
  lay the groundwork for the novel’s exploration of personal courage and friendship
  through the lens of historical conflict, establishing both Bathurst''s struggles
  with his inner demons and Rujub''s role as a pivotal figure, connecting traditions
  of Indian mystique with the unfolding drama of war.'
