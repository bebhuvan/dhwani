  Lectures by the Swami Vivekananda on Jnana Yoga) is a philosophical text comprising
  lectures delivered by Swami Vivekananda in New York at the beginning of 1896, published
  by the Vedanta Society of New York in 1902. These lectures represent the systematic
  exposition of Advaita Vedanta philosophy and the path of Jnana Yoga (the yoga of
  knowledge) that Vivekananda delivered to Western audiences in the years following
  his triumphant appearance at the 1893 Parliament of the World''s Religions in Chicago.
  The work was prepared for publication after Vivekananda''s lectures and later copyrighted
  in 1907 by Swami Abhedananda, one of Vivekananda''s brother disciples who continued

Jnana Yoga, the yoga of knowledge, represents one of the four classical paths to spiritual realization in Hindu philosophy, alongside Bhakti Yoga (devotion), Karma Yoga (action), and Raja Yoga (meditation). However, the knowledge Vivekananda discusses is not intellectual or academic knowledge but rather the direct realization of ultimate truth—specifically, the knowledge of Brahman (the absolute reality) and Atman (the true Self) and the realization of their fundamental identity. This teaching represents the core of Advaita Vedanta, the non-dualistic school of Hindu philosophy systematized by the eighth-century philosopher Adi Shankaracharya. According to this philosophy, the multiplicity of the phenomenal world is ultimately illusory (Maya), and the only true reality is Brahman, infinite, eternal, and undifferentiated consciousness. The individual soul or Atman is not separate from Brahman but is Brahman itself, appearing separate only due to ignorance (Avidya).

The lectures in this volume explore fundamental Vedantic concepts with remarkable clarity and systematic rigor. Vivekananda addresses the nature of the Atman or Self, distinguishing it from both the physical body and the mind, and asserting its eternally pure, perfect, and unchanging nature. He explicates the concept of Maya—the cosmic power by which the one Brahman appears as the many phenomena of the universe—in terms that make this difficult concept accessible to Western audiences unfamiliar with Indian philosophical categories. He discusses the bondage of the soul and its freedom, the real and the apparent nature of existence, and the practical methods by which one can realize the truth of non-duality. Throughout, he emphasizes that Vedanta is not mere speculation but a science based on direct spiritual experience, verifiable through practice just as physical sciences are verifiable through experiment.

Vivekananda's presentation of these ancient teachings was revolutionary in several respects. First, he addressed Western audiences in English, making sophisticated Indian philosophy accessible to those without knowledge of Sanskrit or training in traditional Indian learning. Second, he framed Vedantic teachings in terms resonant with modern scientific thought, emphasizing rational inquiry, empirical verification through experience, and universal principles rather than sectarian dogma. He presented Vedanta not as a religion requiring faith in particular historical events or supernatural claims, but as a science of consciousness open to investigation by anyone regardless of cultural or religious background. Third, he emphasized the practical and ethical implications of Vedantic philosophy, connecting the realization of the unity of all existence with compassion, service, and social reform. This presentation made ancient Indian philosophy relevant to contemporary concerns and demonstrated its potential contribution to solving modern problems.

The context of these lectures—delivered in New York in 1896 during Vivekananda's extended American tour—is crucial for understanding their significance. Following his celebrated appearance at the 1893 Parliament of Religions, where he introduced Hinduism to Western audiences with his iconic salutation "Sisters and brothers of America," Vivekananda spent nearly four years lecturing across the United States and Europe. He established the Vedanta Society in New York and laid the groundwork for the Ramakrishna Mission, organizations that continue his work of disseminating Vedantic teachings and conducting humanitarian service. These lectures on Jnana Yoga represented his most systematic philosophical teaching, complementing his earlier popular lectures with detailed exposition of Vedantic metaphysics and epistemology. They trained serious students in the philosophical foundations necessary for advanced spiritual practice.

The publication of these lectures in 1902 by the Vedanta Society represented a milestone in the transmission of Indian philosophy to the West. This work, along with Vivekananda's other writings and lectures, played a crucial role in changing Western perceptions of Hinduism from exotic superstition to sophisticated philosophy worthy of serious intellectual engagement. The lectures influenced the development of comparative philosophy and religious studies as academic disciplines and contributed to the growing Western interest in meditation, yoga, and Eastern spirituality that would characterize the twentieth century. Vivekananda's presentation of Jnana Yoga demonstrated that the path of knowledge—rigorous philosophical inquiry combined with meditative practice—could lead to the same spiritual realization as devotional or mystical paths, making it particularly appealing to intellectually-oriented seekers. Today, these lectures remain foundational texts for students of Vedanta and continue to offer penetrating insights into the nature of consciousness, reality, and human potential.
