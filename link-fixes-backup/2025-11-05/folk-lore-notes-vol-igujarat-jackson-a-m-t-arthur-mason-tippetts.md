# Folk Lore Notes. Vol. I—Gujarat

## Overview

"Folk Lore Notes. Vol. I—Gujarat" by A. M. T. Jackson is a collection of folkloric materials compiled in the early 20th century. The book focuses on the beliefs, practices, and rituals of the people in Gujarat, highlighting themes of local deities, nature powers, and various customs that comprise the rich tapestry of Indian folklore. It serves both as an exploration of rural traditions and as a tribute to Jackson, who collected these insights during his lifetime.

## Collection Methodology

The work details the context of its compilation, emphasizing the importance of recording rapidly changing folk traditions in Western India around the turn of the century. Jackson's inquiry into local beliefs employed a questionnaire distributed among schoolmasters, aimed at capturing the essence of spiritual and cultural practices. R. E. Enthoven, who published these notes posthumously, reflects on their significance as documents revealing knowledge about the worship of spirits, minor deities, and various ceremonial practices crucial to understanding Gujarati folklore.

## Cultural Significance

This collection provides valuable anthropological and cultural documentation of 19th-century Indian folklore, preserving knowledge that might otherwise have been lost as traditional practices changed under colonial and modernizing influences.
