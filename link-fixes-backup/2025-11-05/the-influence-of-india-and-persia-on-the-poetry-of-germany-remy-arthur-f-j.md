# The Influence of India and Persia on the Poetry of Germany

## Overview

"The Influence of India and Persia on the Poetry of Germany" by Arthur F. J. Remy is a scholarly study investigating the significant impact that Indo-Iranian literature had on German poetry. The work focuses particularly on the 19th century in Germany, a time marked by a notable Orientalist movement, examining how various poets incorporated Eastern themes and styles into their works.

## Historical Context and Sources

The author provides an overview of the limited but intriguing knowledge that medieval Europe possessed concerning India and Persia, discussing sources of information from ancient travelers and classical writers who combined truth with fiction in their descriptions. This foundation helps explain how indirect knowledge spurred increasing interest in Eastern poetic forms and stories.

## Literary Influences and Developments

The study examines how these Eastern influences directly shaped prominent German poets such as Goethe, Schiller, and Rückert. The work establishes a foundation for understanding the dynamic interaction between two diverse literary worlds and outlines the scope of cultural and literary exchange that characterized this period of European intellectual history.
