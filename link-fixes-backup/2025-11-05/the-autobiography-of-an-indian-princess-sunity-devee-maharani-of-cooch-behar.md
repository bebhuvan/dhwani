description: '"The Autobiography of an Indian Princess" by Maharani of Cooch Behar
  Sunity Devee is a personal memoir written in the early 20th century. The work details
  the life of Sunity Devee, a member of an Indian royal family, and focuses on her
  experiences growing up in a traditional society that grapples with the tensions
  between old customs and modern influences. Through her story, the memoir delves
  into themes of family, culture, and the complexities of love and duty in a changing
  India.  The opening of the autobiography introduces us to Sunity Devee''s childhood,
  which is marked by a blend of privilege and the challenges posed by her family''s
  embrace of progressive ideas, particularly her father''s role in the Brahmo Samaj
  movement, which sought to reform Hindu practices. Sunity, born in Calcutta in the
  mid-19th century, recounts her happy early years filled with familial love, traditional
  values, and rich cultural experiences. As she narrates her childhood, she also reflects
  on her parents'' sacrifices and the radical choices they made, including their departure
  from caste restrictions. This foundation of love and education shapes her identity
  and prepares her for the significant events that follow, such as her arranged marriage
  to the Maharajah of Cooch Behar—a union that promises to merge her progressive ideals
  with the traditional expectations of royal life.'
