Edward Washburn Hopkins' "The Great Epic of India: Its Character and Origin" (1901) stands as a landmark work in early American Indological scholarship, representing the culmination of late nineteenth-century analytical approaches to the Mahabharata. Published by Charles Scribner's Sons in New York at the dawn of the twentieth century, this study emerged from Hopkins' rigorous academic training at Leipzig under Ernst Windisch, where he completed his doctorate in 1881, and his subsequent appointment as Salisbury Professor of Sanskrit and Comparative Philology at Yale University in 1895, succeeding the eminent William Dwight Whitney.

Hopkins' scholarly formation reflects the deep influence of German Indology on American Sanskrit studies during this period. His work draws heavily on the theories of Adolf Holtzmann Jr., particularly the controversial "inversion theory" articulated in "Das Mahabharata und seiner Theile" (1892-1895), which posited that the Mahabharata originally celebrated Kaurava heroes before being appropriated and transformed by poets allied with the Pandavas. Hopkins sought to provide a more nuanced chronological framework while accepting Holtzmann's fundamental premise of an epic nucleus overlaid with successive accretions. This approach embodied the prevailing German analytical method that viewed the Mahabharata as an amalgam of heroic traditions and later Brahmanic interpolations, often interpreted through the lens of racial theories concerning Aryan invaders and indigenous populations.

The 1901 volume addressed what Hopkins perceived as critical gaps in Mahabharata scholarship. At the time of publication, the epic had not received systematic examination of its reflected literature, careful metrical analysis, comprehensive philosophical review, or comparative study alongside other epic poetry traditions. Hopkins' methodology combined philological rigor with comparative approaches, analyzing the text's meter, philosophy, mythology, and narrative structure to construct a detailed stratification theory. He proposed five distinct compositional strata, beginning with a prehistorical stage prior to 400 BCE featuring Kaurava lays, followed by the formation of an organized Bharata epic between 400-200 BCE with the Pandavas as protagonists, and subsequent reworking between 200 BCE and 200 CE that elevated Krishna to centrality and greatly expanded the narrative scope.

Hopkins' dating schema placed the Mahabharata's composition generally between 200 and 400 CE, though he acknowledged later additions. His critical method sought to identify an "Ur-text" beneath layers of interpolation, importing techniques from Biblical criticism to Sanskrit textual analysis. He characterized the Mahabharata as possessing chapters recognized as interpolations (praksipta), describing it as "a text that is no text, enlarged and altered in every recension," where "no check was put on any reciter or copyist." This analytical atomism led Hopkins to perceive the epic as what V.S. Sukthankar would later characterize as "a nebulous mass of incongruities, absurdities, contradictions, anachronisms, accretions and interpolations."

The work's relationship to German Indology extended beyond methodological borrowing to encompass problematic racial interpretations prevalent in late nineteenth-century scholarship. Following Holtzmann Sr.'s 1854 identification of an Indo-Greek-Germanic common epic tradition, Hopkins' framework incorporated assumptions about Aryan racial history and the transformation of invading populations through contact with indigenous inhabitants. This approach aligned with the broader German Indological project, shared by scholars such as Hermann Oldenberg, Hermann Jacobi, and Georg von Simon, who sought evidence of a heroic Aryan master race in the epic's reconstructed core. Such interpretations read the Mahabharata primarily as evidence of racial mixing between light-skinned Aryans and "dark-skinned aborigines" or "negroid inhabitants of the subcontinent."

Hopkins' critical methods and conclusions faced substantial scholarly challenge in subsequent decades. V.S. Sukthankar, the principal editor of the Critical Edition of the Mahabharata initiated at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute in 1919, delivered devastating critiques in his posthumously published lectures "On the Meaning of the Mahabharata" (1957). Sukthankar condemned Hopkins' dating table as "for all intents and purposes...as good as useless," declaring that "all dates" given by Hopkins were "quite hypothetical and perfectly arbitrary" with not a single figure or statement "that can be verified or which can lay claims to objective validity." Sukthankar argued that the atomistic methods of advanced critics like Hopkins had "proved barren of any useful or intelligent result," leading to Hopkins' "interesting discovery that there was no text there at all."

Despite these critiques, Hopkins' work exerted considerable influence on twentieth-century epic studies, establishing paradigms that persisted even as their foundations eroded. His five-stage stratification model and dating proposals continued to be cited as established facts by scholars including Hans van Buitenen and Romila Thapar, long after Sukthankar had demolished their methodological basis. The 1969 reprinting by Punthi Pustak and subsequent 1993 Motilal Banarsidass edition ensured the work's continued circulation and influence. Hopkins' other major contribution to Mahabharata studies, "Epic Mythology" (1915), further cemented his analytical approach to the epic's religious and mythological dimensions.

The lasting significance of Hopkins' scholarship lies less in its substantive conclusions than in its role as a representative text of early twentieth-century analytical Indology. His work exemplifies the text-historical mode that, alongside synthetic or holistic approaches, has structured scholarly engagement with the Mahabharata throughout the twentieth century. Modern critical reassessments by scholars such as Vishwa Adluri and Joydeep Bagchee in "The Nay Science: A History of German Indology" (2014) and "Philology and Criticism: A Guide to Mahabharata Textual Criticism" (2014) have problematized the very notion of a unified "historical-critical method" in German Indology, identifying Hopkins among the nineteenth-century foundation scholars whose approaches require fundamental reconsideration.

Hopkins' broader scholarly output encompassed comparative religion, ethics, and Indian cultural history, including "The Religions of India" (1895), "India Old and New" (1901), "The History of Religions" (1918), "Origin and Evolution of Religion" (1923), and "The Ethics of India" (1924). His service as secretary of the American Oriental Society and editor of the Journal of the American Oriental Society positioned him as a central figure in American Indological institutions. His contributions to the study of numerical and temporal categories in early Sanskrit literature demonstrated philological precision beyond his controversial epic stratification theories.

The methodological legacy of "The Great Epic of India" remains contested terrain in contemporary Mahabharata scholarship. While Sukthankar's work on the Critical Edition demonstrated the viability of systematic textual reconstruction without recourse to speculative stratification, and while postcolonial critiques have exposed the racial ideologies undergirding much nineteenth-century Indology, Hopkins' work continues to frame discussions of epic formation and development. The text's sustained availability through multiple reprintings and digital archives ensures its continuing presence in the scholarly conversation, even as its conclusions face ongoing reevaluation. Hopkins' attempt to provide comprehensive analysis of the Mahabharata's character and origin, whatever its limitations, established parameters for debate that have shaped more than a century of subsequent scholarship on the great Indian epic.
