# India: What Can It Teach Us?: A Course of Lectures Delivered before the University of Cambridge

## Overview

F. Max Müller's "India: What Can It Teach Us?" (1885) represents a landmark moment in Western engagement with Sanskrit literature and Indian civilization. Delivered as a series of lectures to Cambridge University students preparing for service in India, Müller's work challenges the prevailing assumption that India's intellectual and cultural resources merit only superficial attention. Rather, Müller argues passionately that serious engagement with Sanskrit literature and Indian philosophy should constitute essential preparation for those assuming positions of responsibility in colonial India. The lectures articulate both the intrinsic value of Indian wisdom and its practical utility for imperial administrators.

## The Case for Indian Studies

Müller confronts the skepticism of his audience directly, acknowledging doubts about the utility of lectures on Indian civilization for practical administrators. Rather than accept these doubts, he argues that genuine interest in India's heritage ennobles those who serve there and provides deeper understanding of the people being governed. He challenges the narrow perspective that treats Indian culture as unworthy of serious study, positioning engagement with India's intellectual traditions as a mark of cultivation and wisdom. Müller's defense of Indian studies constitutes an implicit critique of utilitarian approaches that reduce India to a source of commercial profit and political control.

## Sanskrit Literature and Civilization

The lectures examine Sanskrit literature as a window into ancient Indian civilization and philosophical thought. Müller explores the Vedas, Upanishads, and other foundational texts, explaining their significance within Indian intellectual history and their continuing influence on Indian thought and practice. He demonstrates the sophistication and depth of Sanskrit philosophical traditions, comparing them favorably with Western philosophy. Müller's detailed attention to specific texts and concepts makes Sanskrit literature accessible to his Cambridge audience while honoring its complexity and profundity.

## Western and Indian Perspectives

Müller articulates the mutual benefit of intellectual exchange between Western and Indian traditions. Rather than viewing Indian civilization as something to be extracted and exploited, he suggests that respectful engagement with Indian wisdom traditions can enrich Western understanding. His approach anticipates modern comparative philosophy and religious studies, treating different traditions as worthy interlocutors rather than objects of study. Müller's lectures represent an important moment in nineteenth-century Orientalism—qualified by genuine respect for the traditions being studied and conviction of their continuing relevance.
