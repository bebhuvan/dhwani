# Angel: A Sketch in Indian Ink

## Description

B.M. Croker's novel follows Angel Gascoigne, a neglected and vulnerable young girl in a military cantonment during British India, navigating family dysfunction, economic hardship, and emotional deprivation. The narrative explores her isolation, yearning for affection from her cousin Philip Gascoigne, and complex relationships within the imperial social hierarchy. Croker examines childhood vulnerability and the psychological costs of indifference within colonial military society.

## Character and Setting

Set in Ramghur during the oppressive hot season, the novel contrasts Angel's desolate position with the relative comfort and social acceptance enjoyed by other cantonment families. Her strained relationship with her stepfather, Colonel Wilkinson, and her longing for kinship illuminate the emotional landscape of imperial family life. Croker emphasizes Angel's isolation despite being surrounded by community.

## Colonial Context

The work functions as social commentary on British colonial family life and the psychological vulnerabilities of children in military communities. Croker's portrayal of Angel's emotional struggles within the rigid hierarchies of colonial society critiques the indifference and inadequate care available to dependent family members.
