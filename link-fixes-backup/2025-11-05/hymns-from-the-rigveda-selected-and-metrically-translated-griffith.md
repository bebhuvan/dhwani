# Hymns from the Rigveda, Selected and Metrically Translated

## Overview

Ralph T. H. Griffith's translation of the Rigveda, completed between 1889 and 1896, represents the second complete English rendering of this foundational Indo-European text. Unlike H. H. Wilson's earlier prose translation (1850-1888), Griffith attempted to capture the poetic and metrical character of the original Sanskrit hymns through English verse, creating a work that balances scholarly accuracy with literary artistry.

The Rigveda, composed between approximately 1500 and 1200 BCE in archaic Sanskrit, contains 1,028 hymns organized into ten books (mandalas) with 10,600 verses total. As the oldest surviving text in any Indo-European language, it preserves liturgical, mythological, and philosophical material foundational to understanding Vedic religion, Indo-European mythology, and the development of Indian civilization.

Griffith's translation marked a significant achievement in Victorian-era Indology, providing scholars and general readers with access to Vedic literature in a more readable, poetic format than previous translations. Published by E. J. Lazarus and Co. in Benares, the work appeared in four volumes and quickly became a standard reference for English-speaking students of Vedic literature.

## About Ralph T. H. Griffith

Ralph Thomas Hotchkin Griffith (1826-1906) emerged as one of the most productive translators of Sanskrit literature in the 19th century. Born on May 25, 1826, in England, Griffith devoted his scholarly career to making ancient Indian texts accessible to Western audiences through English translations.

Griffith served as a member of the Indian Education Service, spending significant portions of his career in India where he gained direct exposure to Sanskrit learning traditions. His position provided access to Sanskrit scholars, manuscript collections, and the living tradition of Vedic recitation, enriching his understanding of the texts he translated.

His translation achievements extended beyond the Rigveda to encompass the complete Vedic corpus: the Samaveda (1893), the Yajurveda (1899), and the Atharvaveda (1895-1896). This comprehensive engagement with Vedic literature made Griffith one of the few Western scholars to translate all four Vedas into English. He also produced translations of the Ramayana and other Sanskrit classics, demonstrating remarkable linguistic facility and scholarly dedication.

Griffith's translations, while based on Sayana's medieval commentary like Wilson's work, prioritized literary expression and metrical correspondence. He aimed to convey not merely the literal meaning but the poetic character of Sanskrit verse, employing various English meters to approximate the rhythmic patterns of Vedic Sanskrit. This methodology reflected his belief that the Rigveda's literary and aesthetic dimensions deserved preservation alongside its doctrinal content.

He died on November 7, 1906, leaving a substantial body of translation work that continued to serve students and scholars throughout the 20th century and remains accessible through digital repositories today.

## Differences from Wilson's Translation

While both Wilson and Griffith relied heavily on Sayana's 14th-century commentary for interpretation, their translations differ significantly in approach and execution. Understanding these differences illuminates the choices translators faced when rendering ancient texts into modern languages.

### Prose versus Verse

Wilson adopted prose translation, prioritizing clarity and literal accuracy over poetic form. His sentences often run long, incorporating multiple explanatory phrases and parenthetical clarifications drawn from Sayana's commentary. This approach served scholarly purposes but sometimes produced cumbersome English distant from the Rigveda's original poetic character.

Griffith chose metrical translation, attempting to reproduce the hymns' poetic qualities through English verse. He employed various meters including ballad meter, common meter, and blank verse to approximate the rhythmic patterns of Gayatri, Trishtubh, Jagati, and other Sanskrit meters. This approach created more readable, aesthetically pleasing translations that conveyed something of the original's emotional and artistic dimensions.

### Literalness versus Readability

Wilson's translation hews closely to Sayana's interpretations, often preserving Sanskrit word order and incorporating technical vocabulary. His commitment to literal accuracy sometimes resulted in awkward phrasing that challenged general readers while providing detailed evidence for scholars examining specific passages.

Griffith prioritized readability and fluency, occasionally departing from strict literalness to create coherent English poetry. He condensed or expanded passages as needed to fit metrical patterns, rearranged word order to accommodate English syntax, and selected English vocabulary for poetic rather than purely lexical correspondence. These choices made his translation more accessible to general readers but sometimes obscured nuances visible in more literal renderings.

### Scholarly Apparatus

Wilson's translation includes extensive footnotes, commentary, and scholarly discussion engaging with Sayana's interpretations and alternative readings. His work functions as both translation and scholarly edition, providing readers with tools for critical engagement with the text.

Griffith's translation contains fewer notes and less scholarly apparatus, focusing primarily on the translated verses themselves. His preface and introduction provide contextual information, but the body of the work emphasizes poetic accessibility over scholarly documentation. This streamlined presentation suited general readers and students seeking literary engagement rather than technical philological analysis.

### Reception and Influence

Contemporary scholars generally regard Wilson's translation as more accurate in capturing detailed meanings, while acknowledging Griffith's superior literary quality. Stephanie Jamison and Joel Brereton's modern translation (2014) draws on both predecessors while incorporating advances in linguistic understanding unavailable to 19th-century translators.

Griffith's metrical translation influenced popular reception of Vedic literature, making it accessible to readers without Sanskrit training and contributing to broader cultural engagement with Indian religious traditions. His work appeared in anthologies, inspired poetic responses, and shaped how English-speaking audiences imagined Vedic culture during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

## Structure and Content of the Rigveda

The Rigveda's ten mandalas exhibit complex organizational principles combining chronological, liturgical, and familial criteria. Mandalas 2-7, known as the "family books," constitute the oldest textual stratum, composed by hereditary clans of ritual specialists and arranged by decreasing hymn length. Mandalas 1 and 10 represent later additions, likely composed during the late Vedic period.

### Major Deities

**Agni** (fire) receives approximately 200 hymns, reflecting his role as sacrificial fire and mediator between human and divine realms. As the priest among gods and god among priests, Agni consumed offerings and conveyed them to celestial recipients, making him essential to Vedic sacrifice.

**Indra**, the warrior king of gods, dominates the Rigveda with approximately 250 hymns celebrating his cosmic victory over Vritra, the serpent-demon of drought. Fortified by soma, Indra wielded his thunderbolt to release the cosmic waters, establishing order and enabling life. His martial prowess, excessive appetites, and heroic character made him the preeminent Vedic deity.

**Soma** represents both the sacred plant and its personified deity, receiving approximately 120 hymns. The soma sacrifice involved pressing the plant's stalks, filtering the juice, and offering it to gods while participants consumed portions. The soma's intoxicating effects enabled divine communion, visionary knowledge, and temporary transcendence of mortality.

**Varuna**, guardian of cosmic order (rta) and omniscient sovereign, received fewer hymns but held supreme theological importance. His thousand eyes (the stars) surveyed all actions, and he bound transgressors with ropes of sin. The hymns to Varuna exhibit distinctive ethical concern, with supplicants confessing sins and requesting release from his fetters.

**Ushas** (Dawn), the most prominent goddess, embodied cyclical renewal of light and consciousness. The dawn hymns celebrate her arrival in chariots, her revelation of cosmic order, and her awakening of all creatures with particular poetic beauty.

### Thematic Content

The Rigveda encompasses diverse thematic material: divine invocations and praise, sacrificial procedures and their cosmic significance, cosmogonic speculation about creation's origins, ethical reflections on sin and divine judgment, philosophical questioning about ultimate reality, and early hints of monistic thinking that anticipated Upanishadic non-dualism.

Late Rigvedic hymns like the Nasadiya Sukta (10.129) articulate sophisticated philosophical skepticism about cosmogony, questioning even the gods' knowledge of creation's origins: "Who really knows? Who will here proclaim it? Whence was it produced? Whence is this creation?" This philosophical dimension foreshadowed the Upanishadic tradition's metaphysical inquiries.

## Ritual Context and Vedic Sacrifice

The Rigvedic hymns functioned as liturgical texts employed within elaborate sacrificial ceremonies (yajnas). Understanding their ritual context illuminates their original function and meaning. Vedic sacrifice created sacred space where divine and human realms intersected through offerings and invocations.

### Yajna Structure

Vedic sacrifices ranged from simple domestic rites to elaborate multi-day royal ceremonies. Basic elements included: consecrated ground (vedi), ritual fires, offerings (ghee, grain, soma), patron (yajamana), officiating priests, liturgical recitations (mantras), and gifts to priests (dakshina).

Three ritual fires structured the sacred space: the householder's fire (garhapatya), the southern fire (daksinagni), and the offertorial fire (ahavaniya). These fires represented cosmic principles and divine presences essential to sacrificial efficacy.

### Priestly Specialization

Four chief priests conducted major sacrifices, each associated with a different Veda:

**Hotri**: Recited invocations from the Rigveda, calling deities to sacrifice and praising their attributes through metrical verses.

**Adhvaryu**: Performed physical ritual actions detailed in the Yajurveda, including building altars, preparing offerings, and making oblations at prescribed moments.

**Udgata**: Chanted melodic hymns (samans) set to ritual melodies preserved in the Samaveda, accompanying key ritual moments with musical elaboration.

**Brahma**: Supervised the ceremony, correcting errors through supplementary verses from the Atharvaveda and ensuring ritual purity and proper execution.

This specialization required extensive training in distinct Vedic traditions (shakhas), creating a hereditary class of ritual specialists who preserved and transmitted Vedic knowledge across generations.

### Soma Sacrifice

The soma sacrifice represented Vedic ritual's pinnacle, paradigmatically reenacting Indra's cosmic victory over Vritra. The pressing of soma stalks between stones symbolized the crushing of chaos, while the release of sacred fluid represented liberation of cosmic waters. Participants experienced the soma's effects as divine communion, visionary knowledge, and temporary immortality.

## Textual Transmission and Preservation

The Rigveda's transmission for over three millennia through oral tradition represents an extraordinary achievement of cultural continuity. Multiple mnemonic techniques ensured textual accuracy:

**Samhita-patha** (continuous recitation) preserved the flowing text as spoken naturally, while **Pada-patha** (word-by-word recitation) clarified boundaries obscured by sandhi rules. More complex methods including **Krama-patha** (step recitation), **Jata-patha** (mesh recitation), and **Ghana-patha** (dense recitation) created multiple cross-references enabling error detection and correction.

These recitation methods, supplemented by precise accent notation and phonetic treatises (Pratishakhyas), created a multi-layered system of textual verification that scholars describe as exhibiting "unparalleled fidelity." UNESCO recognized this oral tradition as Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.

The Rigveda was eventually committed to writing, with the oldest surviving manuscripts dating to approximately 1040 CE. These Kashmiri manuscripts on birch bark represent the Shakala recension with Sayana's commentary. UNESCO inscribed this manuscript collection on the Memory of the World Register in 2007.

## Scholarly Significance

### Indo-European Studies

The Rigveda's accessibility through translations like Griffith's catalyzed Indo-European comparative linguistics and mythology. Scholars recognized systematic correspondences between Vedic Sanskrit and European languages, confirming the Indo-European language family hypothesis.

Vedic deities found parallels across Indo-European cultures: Varuna with Greek Ouranos, Indra with Thor and Perun, Agni with Latin ignis, and the Ashvins with the Dioscuri. These comparisons revealed shared heritage across Eurasia, transforming understanding of European prehistory.

The rigorous oral tradition preserved archaic linguistic features lost in other branches, making the Rigveda uniquely valuable for reconstructing Proto-Indo-European phonology, morphology, and syntax. Work by August Schleicher, Karl Brugmann, and Antoine Meillet built upon Rigvedic evidence to develop systematic comparative grammar of Indo-European languages.

### Comparative Religion

The Rigveda preserves what may be the oldest recorded Indo-European mythological narratives, offering glimpses of religious concepts from the 2nd millennium BCE. Comparative analysis revealed that Vedic religion and early Iranian religion shared fundamental structures: sky father deities, warrior gods associated with thunder, sacred fire cults, soma/haoma rituals, and sacrifice as cosmic maintenance.

These parallels enabled reconstruction of religious concepts predating the Indo-Iranian split (c. 2000 BCE) and potentially reflecting Proto-Indo-European ritual systems. The Rigveda influenced broader comparative religion scholarship, providing frameworks for analyzing Greek, Roman, Celtic, Germanic, and Slavic religious traditions.

## Translation Methodology and Reception

Griffith stated in his preface that his translation aimed "especially at close fidelity to the letter and the spirit of the original" while being "as readable and intelligible as the nature of the subject and other circumstances permit." This dual commitment to accuracy and accessibility shaped his methodological choices.

Like Wilson, Griffith relied heavily on Sayana's commentary, accepting the medieval scholar's interpretations as generally authoritative. However, Griffith's metrical constraints sometimes required departure from Sayana's readings, leading to creative solutions balancing literal meaning with poetic form.

Contemporary scholars regard Griffith's translation as historically significant but superseded by later work incorporating philological advances. Karl Friedrich Geldner's German translation (1951) and Stephanie Jamison and Joel Brereton's English translation (2014) represent current scholarly consensus, integrating linguistic, historical, and comparative evidence unavailable to 19th-century translators.

Nevertheless, Griffith's translation retains value for its literary qualities, its historical role in mediating Vedic literature to Western audiences, and its documentation of late 19th-century Vedic scholarship. The work remains widely accessible through digital repositories and continues to serve readers seeking poetic engagement with Vedic hymns.
