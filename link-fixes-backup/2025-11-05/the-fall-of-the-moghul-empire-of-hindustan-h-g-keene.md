# The Fall of the Moghul Empire of Hindustan

## Overview

Published by W.H. Allen & Co. in Oxford in 1887, *The Fall of the Moghul Empire of Hindustan* represents H.G. Keene's mature historiographical treatment of Mughal imperial disintegration during the eighteenth century. The work specifically chronicles the period from the murder of Emperor Alamgir II in 1759 to the British occupation of Delhi in 1803, providing what Keene characterized as "a detailed account of the great Anarchy that marked the conclusion of the eighteenth century." The 1887 edition constituted a substantial revision of his earlier 1876 work *Fall of the Mughal Empire*, reproduced "in a form more adapted to the use of students" with "considerable additions and emendations." While Keene acknowledged that "the rise and meridian of the Moghul Empire have been related in Elphinstone's History of India," his contribution focused on the empire's terminal phase, examining the intersection of internal dynastic collapse with the ascendancy of regional powers and British territorial expansion.

Keene's analysis incorporated both Persian chronicles and English administrative records available to a colonial civil servant with three decades of field experience in the North-Western Provinces. The narrative traces the systematic erosion of Mughal central authority through succession crises, fiscal exhaustion following Aurangzeb's Deccan campaigns, and the inability of Delhi's emperors to control provincial governors (*subahdars*) who became de facto independent rulers. The work documents the devastating impact of Nadir Shah's 1739 Persian invasion, which resulted in the massacre and fifty-eight-day sack of Delhi with plunder estimated at thirty-two million sterling, followed by repeated Afghan incursions under Ahmad Shah Durrani between 1748 and 1767. Keene examined the Maratha expansion northward as the most significant indigenous challenge to Mughal hegemony, particularly under the Peshwa administration and military commanders like Mahadji Shinde (Madhava Rao Sindhia), whose later biography Keene would produce for the *Rulers of India* series in 1892.

The work situates the British East India Company's territorial acquisitions within this context of imperial fragmentation, portraying Company expansion as filling political vacuums rather than conquering functioning states. Keene's treatment of the period from the Battle of Buxar (1764) through Lord Lake's campaigns culminating in the Second Anglo-Maratha War (1803) emphasized British administrative efficiency against what he depicted as indigenous misgovernment and anarchy. This interpretive framework reflected late nineteenth-century colonial historiography's teleological view of British paramountcy as historically inevitable, a perspective that would face sustained scholarly revision throughout the twentieth century.

## About the Author — H.G. Keene

Henry George Keene (1826-1915) served in the Indian Civil Service from 1847 to 1882, retiring with the decoration of Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) and an established literary reputation as a historian of medieval and modern India. Educated at Rugby under Thomas Arnold and Wadham College, Oxford, before training at Haileybury, Keene entered Bengal Civil Service employment in the North-Western Provinces. During the 1857 Indian Rebellion, he served as Superintendent at Dehra Dun, an experience he later documented in *Fifty-Seven: Some Account of the Administration in Indian Districts During the Revolt of the Bengal Army*. Despite his scholarly productivity, Keene's career advancement was limited by frequent disagreements with administrative superiors; after thirty-five years of service, he had not progressed beyond district and sessions judge. He retired in 1882 but continued historical writing until his death on 26 March 1915.

Keene's historiographical corpus focused primarily on the Mughal period and its aftermath, establishing him as a significant figure in colonial Indian historical scholarship. His major works included *The Moghul Empire: From the Death of Aurungzeb to the Overthrow of the Mahratta Power* (1866), *The Turks in India: Critical Chapters on the Administration of That Country by the Chughtai, Bábar, and His Descendants* (1879), *A Sketch of the History of Hindustán from the First Muslim Conquest to the Fall of the Mughol Empire* (1885), and *Madhava Rao Sindhia (Rulers of India)* (1892). He also produced *A Handbook for Visitors to Delhi and its Neighbourhood* and edited *The Oriental Biographical Dictionary*. Keene's son, Henry George Keene the elder (1781-1864), had been a Persian scholar and professor of Arabic and Persian at the East India College at Haileybury from 1824, providing the younger Keene with linguistic resources and orientalist scholarship networks.

Keene's historical methodology reflected the colonial administrator-historian tradition, combining archival research with firsthand administrative experience but operating within interpretive frameworks that privileged British governance and often uncritically accepted official Mughal chronicles' religious rhetoric. His work exemplified what Ranajit Guha would later critique as the "prose of counter-insurgency," wherein indigenous political agency was systematically minimized in favor of narratives emphasizing disorder, despotism, and administrative incapacity requiring British intervention.

## The Work

The narrative structure of *The Fall of the Moghul Empire of Hindustan* follows a chronological progression through the critical forty-four years between 1759 and 1803, though it necessarily references antecedent events from Aurangzeb's death in 1707 to establish causation. Keene attributed Mughal decline fundamentally to the exhaustion produced by Aurangzeb's prolonged Deccan campaigns (1681-1707), which depleted imperial treasuries, alienated Rajput allies through religious policies, and created power vacuums in northern provinces. The succession wars following Aurangzeb's death—particularly the Battle of Jajau (1707) where Bahadur Shah I defeated and killed his brother Azam Shah and his sons—established a pattern of fratricidal conflict that would characterize subsequent transitions, including the brief, chaotic reign of Jahandar Shah (1712-1713).

Keene's account emphasizes the transformation of provincial governors into autonomous rulers who merely paid nominal tribute to Delhi while exercising sovereign power in their territories. The Nizam of Hyderabad, the Nawabs of Awadh and Bengal, and the Rohilla Afghan chiefs all effectively seceded during the reigns of the "Later Mughals" (1707-1857). The Persian invasion of 1739 under Nadir Shah represented a catastrophic turning point; Keene documented how the massacre in Delhi's streets, the seizure of the Peacock Throne, and the acquisition of the Koh-i-Noor diamond symbolized Mughal impotence and invited further predation. Ahmad Shah Durrani's subsequent Afghan invasions (1748-1767) subjected northwestern India to repeated plundering expeditions, culminating in the Third Battle of Panipat (1761), which Keene analyzed as simultaneously crushing Maratha northward expansion and further demonstrating Delhi's inability to defend its territories.

The Maratha threat constituted Keene's primary focus for indigenous challenges to Mughal authority. He traced Maratha expansion from Shivaji's seventeenth-century resistance through the Peshwa-directed confederacy that dominated eighteenth-century Indian politics. Under Peshwas Baji Rao I (1720-1740) and Balaji Baji Rao (1740-1761), Maratha armies extracted *chauth* (one-quarter) and *sardeshmukhi* (one-tenth) taxation from Mughal territories while establishing their own administrative systems. Keene's treatment of Maratha statecraft wavered between acknowledging their military effectiveness and administrative sophistication, and depicting them through orientalist lenses as predatory and unstable. His analysis of figures like Mahadji Shinde, who became the power behind the Mughal throne in the 1780s and 1790s, revealed tensions between recognizing indigenous political agency and maintaining narratives of general anarchy requiring British stabilization.

Keene's account of British East India Company expansion portrayed territorial acquisition as reactive and defensive rather than aggressively imperialist. Beginning with the 1757 Battle of Plassey and the 1764 Battle of Buxar, which secured the *diwani* (revenue collection rights) of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa, Keene depicted Company officials as reluctantly assuming administrative responsibilities in regions where indigenous governance had collapsed. His narrative emphasized Company military superiority, administrative efficiency, and the rule of law against what he characterized as indigenous despotism, corruption, and arbitrary violence. The campaigns of Lord Lake (1803) that resulted in the capture of Delhi, the restoration of Shah Alam II under British protection, and the defeat of Maratha forces at Assaye and Laswari are presented as establishing stability and order in place of chronic warfare.

The work's periodization, ending in 1803 rather than extending to the 1857 Rebellion and final deposition of Bahadur Shah II, reflects Keene's focus on the moment when British paramountcy became irreversible rather than on the Mughal dynasty's formal termination. This structure implicitly argued that effective Mughal sovereignty ended with British occupation of the imperial capital, reducing subsequent emperors to pensioned figureheads. Keene's treatment of economic factors—fiscal crises, the jagirdari system's collapse, debasement of currency, and agricultural devastation from continuous warfare—provided material explanations for political fragmentation, though always within interpretive frameworks that contrasted Mughal "misgovernment" with British administrative rationality.

## Historical Significance

*The Fall of the Moghul Empire of Hindustan* functioned as a foundational text in late nineteenth-century colonial historiography of the Mughal decline, establishing interpretive paradigms that dominated British and early Indian historical writing. Keene's work exemplified what scholars now categorize as the "administrative" school of colonial history, produced by civil servants who combined archival research with field experience but operated within ideological frameworks justifying British rule. His portrayal of eighteenth-century India as an "anarchy" requiring European intervention provided historical legitimation for the British Raj by depicting indigenous states as incapable of stable governance. This interpretive strategy, shared by contemporaries like W.H. Moreland, explicitly argued that Indian economic and political conditions improved under British administration compared to Mughal rule.

The work influenced subsequent colonial-era scholarship, including volumes in the *Rulers of India* series edited by Sir William Wilson Hunter, for which Keene himself contributed the biography of Madhava Rao Sindhia. Early twentieth-century British historians like Vincent Smith and Reginald Coupland absorbed Keene's framework of Mughal decline through internal weakness, religious intolerance, and administrative incompetence. Simultaneously, early nationalist historians like Bankim Chandra Chatterjee and Rabindranath Tagore critiqued this British historiographical tradition as obscuring Indian historical agency; Tagore famously wrote that British-produced Indian history "obscures our vision of India." However, early nationalist counter-narratives often retained elements of the decline framework while shifting blame to external invasions and British exploitation rather than indigenous administrative failures.

Mid-twentieth-century historiographical revisions fundamentally challenged Keene's interpretive paradigms. Scholars like Irfan Habib, Satish Chandra, and M. Athar Ali reexamined the "eighteenth-century crisis," arguing that characterizations of universal anarchy overlooked regional state formation, economic continuities, and sophisticated indigenous political systems. This revisionist scholarship demonstrated that successor states to the Mughal Empire—including the Nizam's Hyderabad, the Nawabs' Bengal and Awadh, and various Maratha polities—developed effective administrative mechanisms and economic policies rather than simply presiding over chaos. The "decline" narrative was reinterpreted as reflecting colonial ideological needs rather than historical reality. Research on the Maratha state system revealed complex revenue administration, diplomatic networks, and cultural patronage that contradicted orientalist depictions of predatory instability.

Recent historiography has further contextualized Keene's work within postcolonial critiques of colonial knowledge production. Scholars like Ranajit Guha and the Subaltern Studies collective analyzed how colonial historiography systematically erased indigenous agency and constructed narratives of European rescue from Oriental despotism. Christopher Bayly's scholarship on the "Indian ecumene" and "information order" demonstrated continuities across the Mughal-British transition that undermined sharp civilizational contrasts. Contemporary historians recognize Mughal decline as a complex transformation involving regional reconfigurations rather than simple collapse, and increasingly emphasize how British military-fiscal systems built upon rather than replaced Mughal administrative foundations. Keene's work thus stands as a significant artifact of Victorian imperial ideology and colonial historiographical method, valuable for understanding how historical narratives served political projects, even as its substantive interpretations have been substantially revised or rejected by modern scholarship.
