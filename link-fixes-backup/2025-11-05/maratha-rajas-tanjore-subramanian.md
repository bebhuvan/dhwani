# Maratha Rajas of Tanjore

## Overview

K. R. Subramanian's 119-page work (1928) documents the Bhonsle Maratha dynasty of Tanjore (Thanjavur), a fascinating case of cultural synthesis. This cadet branch of Shivaji's family, founded by his half-brother Venkoji (Ekoji) in 1676, ruled Tamil-speaking territories until 1855, creating unique blend of Maratha and Tamil cultures.

The chronicle spans from Venkoji's establishment of the kingdom through the culturally prolific reign of Serfoji II (1798-1832), noted patron of Carnatic music, arts, and sciences. It documents how these Maratha rulers adopted Tamil language and cultural practices while maintaining Marathi administrative traditions, their conflicts with remnant Nayak powers, complex relationships with the Nawab of Arcot, evolution into British subsidiary alliance, and extraordinary cultural patronage that made Thanjavur a major center of South Indian arts. Drawing on Marathi inscriptions and Tamil chronicles, the work illuminates this unique regional synthesis. Essential for Tamil Nadu history, Maratha studies, and understanding cultural adaptation by migrant ruling dynasties. Available through Archive.org (DLI collection), public domain.

## The Bhonsle Dynasty and Establishment of Maratha Rule

The Thanjavur Maratha kingdom represents a distinctive chapter in South Indian history, established when Vyankoji (Venkoji) Bhonsle, the younger half-brother of the legendary Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, founded the dynasty in 1676. Born in 1632, Vyankoji initially served as a military commander for the Sultan of Bijapur, who dispatched him to recapture Thanjavur from the usurper Alagiri. Following his military victory, Vyankoji declared independence and established Maratha sovereignty over the fertile Kaveri delta region, creating a cadet branch of the Bhonsle family that would rule for nearly two centuries until 1855.

The dynasty's legitimacy derived from its royal Maratha lineage, yet its success depended upon cultural accommodation. Vyankoji and his successors faced the challenge of governing Tamil-speaking territories while maintaining their Maharashtrian identity and administrative traditions. The kingdom encompassed the agriculturally prosperous Thanjavur region, with its extensive irrigation systems and temple-centered economy inherited from the previous Nayak rulers. This geopolitical position made Thanjavur both wealthy and strategically significant, situated between the expanding Mughal influence in the Deccan, rival South Indian powers, and eventually European colonial interests.

The succession line following Venkoji's death in 1684 reveals the dynasty's internal dynamics. His son Shahji succeeded but died without heirs, leading to the accession of Serfoji I (1712-1728), Venkoji's younger son, whose sixteen-year reign was marked by continuous warfare with the Madurai Nayaks. His brother Tukkoji succeeded in 1728, though this period witnessed considerable instability. Pratapsingh, born to Tukkoji and a concubine named Annapurna, was initially not expected to rule due to his illegitimate status, yet he eventually ascended the throne in 1739, ending a period of anarchy. His reign until 1763 brought relative stability before passing power to his son Thuljaji (1763-1787), who would prove to be the last truly independent ruler of Thanjavur.

## Seventeenth and Eighteenth Century Political History

The political trajectory of Thanjavur under Maratha rule oscillated between autonomy and subordination, shaped by regional power struggles and the gradual British expansion. The late seventeenth century saw the Bhonsles consolidate their authority, with Venkoji devoting considerable attention to agricultural improvement, irrigation infrastructure, and economic development. He widened channels, constructed tanks, and brought fallow lands under cultivation, recognizing that the kingdom's prosperity depended on maximizing agricultural productivity in the fertile delta region where rice cultivation predominated.

The eighteenth century brought increasing external pressures. Serfoji I's reign (1712-1728) was consumed by conflicts with the Madurai Nayaks, remnants of the earlier Nayaka dynasty who contested Maratha authority. These military engagements drained resources and prevented cultural development. Pratapsingh's long reign (1739-1763) provided respite, allowing for administrative consolidation and cultural patronage. However, his son Thuljaji faced mounting challenges from the ambitious Nawab of the Carnatic, who temporarily annexed Thanjavur between 1773 and 1776, demonstrating the kingdom's vulnerability.

The succession crisis following Thuljaji's death in 1787 proved decisive for Thanjavur's independence. A power struggle erupted between his son Serfoji II and his younger brother Amar Singh. The British East India Company, recognizing an opportunity to extend its influence, intervened in this succession dispute. Through a combination of military pressure and diplomatic maneuvering, the British installed Serfoji II on the throne in 1798, but at a significant cost. In October 1799, Thanjavur entered into the subsidiary alliance system with the Company, effectively becoming a protected state under British suzerainty.

The subsidiary alliance transformed Thanjavur from an independent kingdom into a subordinate princely state within the emerging British colonial framework. Under this arrangement, Thanjavur received British protection against external threats while maintaining internal autonomy, but was required to accept British troops stationed in its territory, finance their maintenance, and conduct foreign relations only with British approval. This marked the effective end of Thanjavur's political independence, though the Bhonsle dynasty continued to rule nominally until 1855, when the British formally annexed the state under the Doctrine of Lapse following the death of Shivaji II, the last Maratha raja.

## Administrative Structure and Governance

The Thanjavur Marathas developed a sophisticated administrative system that blended Marathi governmental traditions with Tamil local practices, creating a distinctive hybrid model suited to their deltaic kingdom. At the apex stood the raja, who exercised supreme authority in theory but governed through a council of ministers in practice. The most powerful official was the Dalavoy or Mantri, who served simultaneously as chief minister and commander-in-chief of the military forces. This dual civilian-military role reflected the Maratha tradition of warrior-administrators who could lead armies in wartime and manage governance during peace.

The second highest position was the Pradhani or Dewan, also called Dabir Pandit, who functioned as the chief administrative officer responsible for revenue collection, financial management, and day-to-day governance. Below these senior ministers operated a hierarchy of officials managing various departments including justice, religious endowments, public works, and royal household affairs. The Marathas maintained records in Marathi using the Modi script, a cursive form of Devanagari, preserving their linguistic heritage even while Tamil remained the predominant language of the subject population.

Territorial administration divided the kingdom into five subahs (provinces): Pattukkottai, Mayiladuthurai (erstwhile Mayavaram), Kumbakonam, Mannargudi, and Tiruvadi. Each subah was subdivided into seemais (districts) and further into maganams (village clusters), creating a three-tier administrative hierarchy. This system allowed for efficient tax collection and dispute resolution while maintaining central control. Village-level administration largely continued pre-existing Tamil institutions, with local functionaries interfacing between the Marathi-speaking bureaucracy and Tamil-speaking peasantry.

Revenue administration constituted the kingdom's financial foundation. The Marathas collected taxes through mirasdars or puttackdars, intermediary landholders who held hereditary rights to collect revenue from villages. This system resembled both the Maratha watandar tradition and Tamil mirasi rights, representing another instance of administrative synthesis. Land revenue, based primarily on rice cultivation, formed the bulk of state income. Assessment methods drew upon Malik Ambar's systematic surveys of the Deccan, which had influenced Maratha revenue practices throughout their territories. The currency system employed chakrams or pon (one chakram equaled one and three-fourths of a British East India Company rupee), alongside pagodas (one pagoda equaled three and a half Company rupees) and panams of varying denominations, facilitating both local transactions and international trade.

## Cultural Patronage and Artistic Flourishing

The Thanjavur Marathas distinguished themselves as among the most culturally enlightened rulers in South Indian history, transforming their capital into a preeminent center of artistic achievement that rivaled and perhaps surpassed the greatest courts of the subcontinent. This patronage stemmed partly from political calculation—supporting Tamil cultural institutions helped legitimize Marathi rule over Tamil populations—but also reflected genuine scholarly interests and devotional commitments, particularly to Shaivite Hinduism. The results proved transformative for South Indian artistic traditions, with innovations and refinements made under Maratha patronage continuing to define classical forms today.

The most celebrated cultural patron was Serfoji II (1798-1832), whose enlightened rule coincided with the kingdom's political subordination but cultural apex. A polymath scholar fluent in multiple languages including Tamil, Sanskrit, Telugu, Marathi, and English, Serfoji embodied the cosmopolitan ideal of Indian courtly culture. He authored literary works including Kumarasambhava Champu, Mudrarakshaschaya, and Devendra Kuravanji, demonstrating his mastery of classical Sanskrit and Tamil literary conventions. His scholarly interests extended to Western sciences, and he established contacts with European intellectuals and missionaries, collecting scientific instruments and books on subjects from astronomy to medicine.

Serfoji's most enduring legacy was his passionate expansion of the Saraswati Mahal Library, originally established by the Nayak rulers in the sixteenth century. Recognizing its potential as a center of learning, he employed numerous pandits to travel throughout India collecting, purchasing, and copying manuscripts from renowned centers of Sanskrit scholarship. Under his patronage, the library's holdings expanded dramatically, ultimately encompassing over 49,000 volumes including 39,300 manuscripts in Tamil and Sanskrit, 3,076 Marathi manuscripts from the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries documenting Maharashtrian religious traditions, and 1,342 bundles of Maratha Raj records written in Modi script detailing the kingdom's political, social, and cultural administration. This institution became, and remains, one of Asia's oldest and most significant manuscript repositories, described by Encyclopedia Britannica as "the most remarkable library of India."

## Music, Dance, and Performing Arts

The Thanjavur Marathas revolutionized South Indian performing arts, creating institutional structures and aesthetic standards that continue to define Carnatic music and Bharatanatyam dance. Serfoji II personally championed both traditional and innovative approaches to music, encouraging classical veena and nagaswaram traditions while simultaneously introducing Western instruments including the clarinet and violin into Carnatic ensembles. This musical syncretism, potentially controversial, succeeded because it respected classical ragas and talas while expanding timbral possibilities. The violin particularly flourished, becoming integral to Carnatic music in ways unprecedented in other Indian classical traditions.

Serfoji organized a unique ensemble called the Thanjavur Band, an early attempt to create a large musical group combining diverse instruments in coordinated performance—a concept that prefigured modern orchestral arrangements while remaining rooted in Carnatic principles. He invited the legendary composer Thyagaraja to his court, though the saint famously declined, preferring spiritual devotion to courtly patronage. Nevertheless, the Thanjavur court attracted numerous musicians and composers who developed and refined the Carnatic tradition, establishing the city as one of the trinity of great Carnatic centers alongside Tanjavur's sister cities.

The court's most transformative contribution came in dance. Four brothers—Chinnayya, Ponnayya, Sivanandam, and Vadivelu—collectively known as the Thanjavur Quartet, served in Serfoji II's court and revolutionized South Indian dance. Building upon older Bharata Natyam traditions performed in temples, the Quartet codified and refined the art form's contemporary structure, creating the margam (performance repertoire) that remains standard today. They composed numerous varnams and padams (compositional forms) that showcase both technical virtuosity and devotional expression. Their work elevated temple dance into a sophisticated classical art form, though the association with devadasi traditions later led to its near-extinction under colonial moral reform movements. The twentieth-century revival of Bharatanatyam drew directly upon the Thanjavur Quartet's choreographic innovations, making their Maratha-era contributions foundational to modern classical dance.

## Thanjavur Painting and Visual Arts

The distinctive Thanjavur painting style, now recognized with Geographical Indication status, flourished under Maratha patronage, particularly during Serfoji II's reign. While earlier Nayaka rulers had established painting traditions in Thanjavur, the Marathas introduced innovations that defined the style's characteristic appearance. Royal Maratha artisans pioneered the use of gesso work—a thick preparatory layer of calcium carbonate or chalk mixed with binding agents—upon which they applied intricate designs. This gesso work was then embellished with semi-precious gems, glass beads, and most distinctively, 22-karat gold leaf, creating a three-dimensional quality and luminous effect unmatched in other Indian painting traditions.

Thanjavur paintings typically depicted Hindu deities, particularly Shaivite and Vaishnavite icons, rendered in simple, iconic compositions with rich colors and minimal background detail. The liberal use of gold foil not only enhanced visual splendor but also served practical functions, protecting the paintings and prolonging their lifespan due to gold's non-reactive properties. The style synthesized multiple influences: Deccani painting traditions brought by the Marathas, Vijayanagara aesthetic principles still prevalent in South India, and even European and Company painting styles introduced through coastal trade and missionary contacts. This eclectic fusion produced works of distinctive beauty that adorned palace walls, temple interiors, and private devotional spaces throughout the kingdom.

## Religious Patronage and Temple Architecture

As devout Shaivite Hindus, the Thanjavur Marathas lavished attention on religious institutions, particularly temples dedicated to Shiva. The magnificent Brihadeeswara Temple, built by the Chola emperor Rajaraja I between 1003 and 1010 CE and standing over 200 feet tall, received continuous Maratha patronage. Though they did not construct the original temple—one of the masterpieces of Dravidian architecture—the Marathas maintained, renovated, and embellished it. They commissioned numerous mural paintings within the temple complex, depicting mythological scenes and courtly life in the distinctive Maratha-influenced style that blended Deccani and Tamil aesthetic traditions.

Beyond the Brihadeeswara Temple, the Marathas constructed and renovated numerous smaller shrines, established and endowed religious institutions, and supported brahmin scholars and priests. The Thanjavur Palace complex, built adjacent to the Brihadeeswara Temple, served as both administrative center and devotional space, with private temples and shrines integrated into the royal quarters. This religious patronage served multiple functions: fulfilling personal devotional obligations, legitimizing Maratha rule through association with ancient Tamil religious institutions, supporting the brahmin scholarly class that preserved Sanskrit and Tamil learning, and demonstrating the rulers' role as defenders of Hindu dharma during a period of increasing European Christian missionary activity.

## Legacy and Historical Significance

The Thanjavur Maratha kingdom exemplifies successful cultural synthesis by a migrant ruling dynasty. Unlike many conquerors who imposed alien traditions or remained culturally isolated, the Bhonsles adopted Tamil language, patronized Tamil literature and arts, and integrated themselves into South Indian religious and cultural life while simultaneously maintaining Marathi administrative practices, supporting Maharashtrian religious traditions, and preserving their distinct identity. This dual cultural engagement created a cosmopolitan court culture that enriched both Marathi and Tamil traditions.

The dynasty's cultural contributions far exceeded its political significance. While Thanjavur never wielded great military power and lost political independence by 1799, its artistic and scholarly achievements during the Maratha period established standards and created institutions that continue to influence South Indian culture. The Saraswati Mahal Library preserves irreplaceable manuscript collections. The Thanjavur painting style remains a living tradition practiced by contemporary artists. The Thanjavur Quartet's choreographic innovations underpin modern Bharatanatyam. The court's musical patronage helped define Carnatic music's instrumental traditions. These enduring legacies demonstrate that cultural rather than military power often proves more lasting, and that enlightened patronage can transform regional courts into civilizational centers whose influence extends far beyond their immediate political reach or temporal existence.
