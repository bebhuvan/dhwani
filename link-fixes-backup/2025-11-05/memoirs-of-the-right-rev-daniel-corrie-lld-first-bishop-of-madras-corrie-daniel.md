# Memoirs of the Right Rev. Daniel Corrie, LL.D., first Bishop of Madras

## Overview

"Memoirs of the Right Rev. Daniel Corrie, LL.D., first Bishop of Madras" is a historical account compiled chiefly from Corrie's own correspondence and journals, written in the early to mid-19th century. The work documents Corrie's life from his early years and spiritual development in England to his ministerial work in India, capturing both personal reflections and historical observations. The memoir focuses on Corrie's vocation in the Anglican Church and his historic role as the first Bishop of Madras, exploring themes of religious conviction, missionary work, and the challenges of faith in distant lands.

## Spiritual Journey

The opening provides an intimate portrait of Corrie's early life and ministry primarily through letters and journal excerpts. It recounts his spiritual struggles, sense of inadequacy, and gradual growth in faith, culminating in his ordination and early pastoral roles in rural England. The narrative transitions to his decision to serve as a chaplain in India, chronicling his emotional departure, the rigors of his sea voyage, and his first impressions of Madras and Calcutta.

## Legacy and Impact

Throughout these passages, Corrie's humility, earnestness, and compassion are consistently evident, setting the tone for his later work as a missionary and bishop. The memoir documents an important period in the history of Christianity in India and the personal sacrifices made by early missionary leaders.
