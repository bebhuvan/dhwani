description: |
  "Ten Years in India, in the 16th Queen's Lancers" by W. J. D. Gould, published in 1915, represents systematic ethnographic documentation of Indian social practices, beliefs, and cultural traditions during the colonial period. W. J. D. Gould's work as a colonial administrator and ethnographer involved extensive field research, observation, and documentation of diverse communities, customs, and cultural expressions across India. These ethnographic studies, while shaped by colonial power dynamics and occasionally reflecting problematic assumptions, nevertheless preserved detailed records of social practices, oral traditions, and cultural knowledge that might otherwise have been lost to historical processes of modernization and change.
  
    The scholarly value of these ethnographic works lies in their detailed documentation of specific cultural practices, social organizations, and belief systems at particular historical moments. While contemporary anthropology has developed more sophisticated theoretical frameworks and more reflexive methodologies that acknowledge the power relations inherent in ethnographic research, these earlier works remain valuable as historical documents that capture cultural phenomena during periods of significant social transformation. The systematic nature of W. J. D. Gould's documentation, combined with the breadth of cultural practices recorded, makes these works essential references for understanding historical Indian societies.
  
    For researchers, these ethnographic texts serve multiple purposes: as primary historical sources documenting specific cultural practices and beliefs, as examples of colonial-era ethnographic methodology and its limitations, and as baselines for tracking cultural continuity and change over time. Their preservation in the public domain ensures accessibility for scholars across disciplines including anthropology, history, folklore studies, and cultural studies, contributing to deeper understanding of India's diverse cultural heritage and the complex relationship between documentation, power, and cultural preservation.
