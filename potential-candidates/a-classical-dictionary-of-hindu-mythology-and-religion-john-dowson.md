# A Classical Dictionary of Hindu Mythology and Religion

## Overview

John Dowson's 'Classical Dictionary of Hindu Mythology and Religion, Geography, History, and Literature' remains one of the most comprehensive and accessible reference works on Hindu religious and mythological traditions. First published in 1888 during the Victorian era's intense interest in Oriental studies, this extensive dictionary provides detailed entries alphabetically arranged covering:

**Mythology**: Gods and goddesses (Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Devi, and countless manifestations), demons (asuras, rakshasas), celestial beings (apsaras, gandharvas), and mythological narratives from Puranic and epic sources.

**Sacred Texts**: Vedas, Brahmanas, Upanishads, Puranas, Mahabharata, Ramayana, and other significant religious literature, with summaries of their contents and significance.

**Geography**: Sacred rivers (Ganges, Yamuna), holy sites (Varanasi, Prayag), mythological locations (Mount Meru, the churning of the ocean), and their religious significance.

**Historical Figures**: Philosophers, religious reformers, poets, and kings who shaped Hindu religious and cultural development.

**Concepts**: Theological doctrines (karma, dharma, moksha), philosophical systems (Vedanta, Samkhya), ritual practices, and religious observances.

Dowson drew extensively on Sanskrit sources, synthesizing information from multiple texts to create comprehensive entries. While reflecting 19th-century British scholarly perspectives, the work remains valuable for its systematic organization and broad coverage. The dictionary served generations of students, scholars, and general readers seeking to understand Hindu mythology's complex narratives and characters.

Though modern scholarship has refined many interpretations and corrected some misunderstandings, Dowson's dictionary remains a useful reference for its comprehensive scope and clear presentation, documenting how Victorian-era scholarship understood and transmitted Hindu religious traditions to Western audiences.
