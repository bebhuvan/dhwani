# Ancient India: From the Earliest Times to the First Century A.D.

## Overview

Edward James Rapson's comprehensive survey of ancient Indian history from prehistoric times through the first century CE represents a landmark in early 20th-century Indological scholarship. Published in 1916 as part of the Cambridge History of India series, this work synthesizes archaeological discoveries, literary sources, and numismatic evidence to trace India's development from the Indus Valley Civilization through the Mauryan Empire and subsequent dynasties. The volume examines the Vedic period, the rise of Buddhism and Jainism, Alexander's invasion and its aftermath, the Mauryan consolidation under Chandragupta and Ashoka, and the subsequent fragmentation into Indo-Greek, Indo-Scythian, and Indo-Parthian kingdoms. Rapson, a distinguished numismatist and professor of Sanskrit at Cambridge, brings particular expertise to discussions of coinage and trade, illuminating economic and political connections across ancient India and Central Asia. The work reflects the archaeological knowledge available in the early 20th century, including then-recent discoveries from sites like Taxila and Sanchi, while incorporating classical Western sources (Greek and Roman historians) alongside Indian textual traditions (Puranas, Buddhist chronicles, inscriptions). Though subsequent archaeological discoveries and revised chronologies have modified some conclusions, Rapson's synthesis remains valuable for understanding how early Indologists constructed ancient Indian history and for its detailed analysis of numismatic evidence. The volume established methodological frameworks for integrating diverse source materials that continue influencing Indian historical studies.
