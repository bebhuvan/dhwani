# A Literary History of India

## Overview

R. W. Frazer's 'A Literary History of India' provides a comprehensive survey of Indian literary traditions from ancient Vedic poetry through medieval and early modern works. Published in 1898 during the height of British Indological scholarship, this work examines Sanskrit literature including the Vedas, Brahmanas, Upanishads, the great epics (Mahabharata and Ramayana), classical Sanskrit drama (Kalidasa, Bhasa), lyric poetry, and Puranic literature.

Beyond Sanskrit, Frazer provides one of the early English-language surveys of vernacular Indian literary traditions, discussing the development of Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Marathi, and other regional language literatures. The work situates these literary traditions within their historical, religious, and cultural contexts, examining how Indian letters evolved from sacred Vedic hymns to sophisticated courtly poetry and drama.

While reflecting late Victorian perspectives on Indian culture, the work remains valuable as a historical document of 19th-century literary scholarship and provides comprehensive coverage of texts that were being newly discovered and translated for Western audiences.
