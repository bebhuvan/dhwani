# The Wonder That Was India: A Survey of the Culture of the Indian Sub-Continent Before the Coming of the Muslims

## Overview

Arthur Llewellyn Basham's comprehensive cultural history of ancient India from the Indus Valley Civilization through the coming of Islam stands as one of the most influential and widely-read works on Indian civilization. Originally published in 1954, this masterwork synthesizes archaeology, literature, art, religion, philosophy, social structures, political institutions, and economic life to present a holistic view of Indian culture across three millennia. Basham examines the Harappan civilization, Aryan migrations, Vedic culture, the rise of Buddhism and Jainism, the Mauryan and Gupta empires, classical Hindu philosophy, Sanskrit literature and drama, temple architecture and sculpture, social organization including the caste system, village life and urban culture, scientific achievements in mathematics and astronomy, and artistic traditions in poetry, music, and dance. Written with scholarly rigor yet accessible prose, the work challenges colonial-era stereotypes while presenting Indian civilization's achievements in their own context rather than through Western comparative frameworks. Basham draws on primary sources in Sanskrit, Pali, Prakrit, and Tamil, archaeological evidence from sites like Mohenjo-daro and Nalanda, inscriptions, and material culture to construct a vivid portrait of ancient Indian life. The book explores philosophical systems (Vedanta, Samkhya, Buddhism, Jainism), literary masterpieces (Kalidasa, Bhasa, Bhartrihari), scientific treatises (Aryabhata, Brahmagupta), and artistic achievements (Ajanta paintings, Ellora sculptures). While some interpretations have been revised by subsequent scholarship, particularly regarding Aryan migration theories and chronologies, Basham's work remains essential reading for understanding ancient Indian civilization's complexity and achievements.
