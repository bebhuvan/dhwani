# Original Sanskrit Texts on the Origin and History of the People of India

## Overview

John Muir's monumental five-volume work 'Original Sanskrit Texts on the Origin and History of the People of India' represents one of the most comprehensive 19th-century compilations of Sanskrit source materials bearing on Indian origins, religion, and social institutions. First published between 1858-1870, this scholarly work presents original Sanskrit texts alongside English translations and extensive commentary, examining Vedic literature, Brahmanical texts, caste origins, and the development of Hindu religious and philosophical systems.

Volume 1 (1868) focuses on mythical and legendary accounts of creation and early Indian cosmology found in Vedic and later Sanskrit literature. Muir meticulously presents texts from the Rigveda, Atharvaveda, Brahmanas, and Puranas dealing with creation myths, the origins of the universe, and early Hindu cosmological concepts. The work demonstrates the evolution of Hindu thought from Vedic simplicity to Puranic complexity.

As a pioneering work of 19th-century Indology, Muir's compilation remains valuable for its comprehensive gathering of primary sources, though modern scholarship has refined many of his interpretations. The work reflects both the philological rigor and the limitations of Victorian-era Oriental studies.
