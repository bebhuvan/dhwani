## Historical Significance

**Edward Thornton** compiled this gazetteer during a critical period of East India Company expansion. The work synthesized information from:
- District surveys and settlement reports
- Revenue records and tax assessments

The Gazetteer served multiple purposes:
- **Administrative Tool**: Helped British officials govern vast territories
- **Economic Reference**: Aided commercial planning and resource allocation
- **Military Planning**: Provided strategic geographical information
