# Indian Buddhism

## Overview

Thomas William Rhys Davids' authoritative study of Indian Buddhism traces the historical development, philosophical doctrines, and social impact of Buddhism from its origins in 6th century BCE India through its classical period. Published in 1903 as part of the 'Religions Ancient and Modern' series, this work by the pioneering Pali scholar and founder of the Pali Text Society examines the Buddha's life and teachings, the formation of the Buddhist sangha (monastic community), the development of Buddhist philosophy and ethics, the schisms leading to Theravada and Mahayana traditions, and Buddhism's eventual decline in India. Rhys Davids brings deep expertise in Pali literature, having spent decades translating Buddhist texts and establishing scholarly frameworks for Buddhist studies in the West. The work analyzes key Buddhist concepts (Four Noble Truths, Noble Eightfold Path, dependent origination, anatta) while situating Buddhism within its Indian religious and philosophical context, discussing interactions with Brahmanism, Jainism, and folk traditions. The book examines the Buddhist councils, the Ashokan period's significance for Buddhist expansion, the development of Abhidhamma philosophy, and the eventual absorption of Buddhist practices into Hindu devotional movements. While subsequent scholarship has revised some historical chronologies and philosophical interpretations, Rhys Davids' work remains foundational for understanding how early Western scholars approached Buddhist studies and for its systematic presentation of Buddhist doctrine drawn directly from Pali sources. His emphasis on Buddhism as a rational, ethical philosophy rather than mere mythology influenced Western perceptions and contributed to Buddhism's global spread beyond Asia.
