# The Ocean of Story (Katha Sarit Sagara)

## Overview

The Katha Sarit Sagara (Ocean of the Streams of Story), composed in Sanskrit by the 11th-century Kashmiri poet Somadeva Bhatta, stands as one of the world's greatest story collections, containing hundreds of interconnected tales encompassing romance, adventure, magic, philosophy, and moral instruction. Written around 1070 CE at the court of King Ananta of Kashmir, the work draws on earlier sources including the lost Brihatkatha attributed to Gunadhya, preserving narrative traditions that would otherwise have disappeared.

The frame narrative follows Prince Naravahanadatta, son of the legendary King Udayana, on his quest to become emperor of the Vidyadharas (celestial beings). Within this framework are embedded countless subordinate stories—tales of kings and merchants, ascetics and courtesans, gods and demons—demonstrating Sanskrit literature's rich narrative complexity and the Indian tradition of nested storytelling.

C. H. Tawney's English translation, first published 1880-1884 and revised by N. M. Penzer with extensive notes in the 1920s, made this masterwork accessible to Western readers. Penzer's ten-volume edition (1924-1928) added comprehensive scholarly apparatus examining the tales' origins, parallels in world folklore, and cultural contexts, making it the definitive English version.

The Katha Sarit Sagara preserves invaluable information about medieval Indian society, religious beliefs, folk customs, and literary aesthetics. It influenced later Sanskrit literature, provided source material for countless regional adaptations, and offers parallels to story cycles like the Arabian Nights, demonstrating the universal appeal of well-crafted narrative.
