## Executive Summary

Successfully discovered and curated **10 unique, non-duplicate works** for the Dhwani collection using parallel AI agents. All works have been enriched with metadata and are ready for review.

### Key Achievement
Out of **52 works** initially discovered across 5 Archive.org collections, we identified **10 truly unique works** that fill a critical gap in Dhwani's existing collection: **Buddhist and Pali literature**.

## Methodology

### 1. Discovery Phase (5 Parallel Agents)
Deployed specialized agents to search:
- Cornell University Libraries (Sanskrit literature, Ancient history)
- UC Berkeley Libraries (Buddhism, Regional literature)  
- University of Toronto (Mughal history)

**Results:**
- Cornell Sanskrit: 12 works discovered
- UC Buddhism: 10 works discovered
- Toronto Mughal: 10 works discovered
- Cornell Ancient: 10 works discovered
- UC Regional: 10 works discovered
- **Total: 52 works**

### 2. Deduplication Phase
Rigorous verification against existing collection:
- Cross-checked 385 existing Archive.org IDs
- Cross-checked 301 existing work titles
- Manual review for partial matches and variants

**Results:**
- 42 duplicates identified and removed
- 10 unique works confirmed

### 3. Enrichment Phase
Each work enriched with:
- Wikipedia links (work, author, related topics)
- OpenLibrary links (where available)
- Wikisource links (where available)
- Curated descriptions (factual, no fluff)
- Appropriate collections and tags

### 4. Documentation Phase

## Collection Gap Identified

The existing Dhwani collection was **comprehensive** in:
- Sanskrit classics (Kalidasa, Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas)
- Mughal history (Babur-nama, Akbar biographies)
- Regional literature (Tamil, Bengali works)

But was **missing**:
- Pali canonical texts and commentaries
- Early Western scholarly translations of Buddhist texts
- Comparative religious studies
- Abhidhamma philosophical literature

**This discovery session fills that gap.**
