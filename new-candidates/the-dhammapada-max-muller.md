# The Dhammapada

## Overview

The Dhammapada (1881) presents Friedrich Max Müller's influential English translation of one of Buddhism's most widely read scriptures, published by Oxford's Clarendon Press as part of The Sacred Books of the East series. This work renders into English prose 423 verses attributed to the Buddha, organized into twenty-six chapters covering fundamental teachings on ethics (sila), mindfulness (sati), wisdom (panna), and the path to enlightenment (magga). As the first complete English translation of the Dhammapada, it established a foundation for English-language Buddhist literature and introduced Western readers to core Buddhist concepts through accessible, memorable verses.

## About F. Max Müller

Friedrich Max Müller (1823-1900) was a German-born British philologist and Orientalist who became one of the most influential scholars of comparative religion in the nineteenth century. As Professor of Comparative Philology at Oxford University, Müller undertook the monumental Sacred Books of the East series, editing and translating foundational texts from Asian religious traditions. His scholarly rigor and commitment to making Eastern wisdom accessible to Western audiences helped establish the academic study of religion as a discipline. Müller's work on the Dhammapada represented his first major engagement with Buddhist texts and demonstrated his conviction that understanding diverse religious traditions was essential for human progress.

## Historical Context

This translation appeared in 1881 during a period of intense Western interest in Buddhism, following increased contact between Europe and Asia through colonialism and trade. The late Victorian era saw growing disillusionment with materialism and a search for spiritual alternatives, making Buddhist philosophy particularly appealing to intellectual audiences. Müller's translation, published by the prestigious Clarendon Press, gave the Dhammapada scholarly legitimacy and introduced Buddhist ethical teachings to readers who had limited access to Asian religious texts. The work contributed to the Orientalist movement while also reflecting genuine scholarly engagement with Buddhist philosophy.

## Literary and Cultural Significance

Müller's translation played a crucial role in introducing Buddhism to Western intellectual audiences during the late Victorian era, when growing disillusionment with materialism made Buddhist philosophy particularly appealing. The Dhammapada's emphasis on personal responsibility, mindful conduct, and ethical living resonated with Victorian values while offering alternative perspectives on suffering, impermanence, and spiritual attainment. As the first complete English translation, Müller's work established translation conventions and interpretive frameworks that shaped subsequent Buddhist scholarship. The text's inclusion in the prestigious Sacred Books of the East series—which Müller edited—gave it scholarly legitimacy and demonstrated that Asian religious traditions merited serious academic attention comparable to that accorded biblical and classical texts. The Dhammapada became one of the most frequently translated Buddhist scriptures, with Müller's version remaining influential and widely read over a century later.
