# Studies in Mughal India

## Overview

Studies in Mughal India (1919) presents Sir Jadunath Sarkar's influential collection of historical essays examining governance, society, and politics of the Mughal Empire, particularly during Emperor Aurangzeb's reign (1658-1707). This 330-page work (M.C. Sarkar, Calcutta) draws extensively from Persian primary sources—official chronicles (akhbarat), administrative manuals (dastur-ul-amal), farmans (royal decrees), and contemporary court accounts—employing modern historiographical methods to illuminate Mughal administrative systems, revenue collection (zamindari, jagir), provincial governance (subadari), military organization (mansabdari), and social dynamics.

## About Jadunath Sarkar

Sir Jadunath Sarkar (1870-1958) was one of modern India's most distinguished historians and the preeminent specialist on the Mughal dynasty. Trained in European historical methods while deeply versed in Persian sources, Sarkar revolutionized the study of Mughal history by combining rigorous archival research with critical analysis of primary texts. His mastery of Persian enabled him to access and interpret official Mughal documents, chronicles, and correspondence that previous historians had overlooked or misunderstood. Sarkar's multi-volume history of Aurangzeb and his numerous studies of Mughal administration established him as the leading authority on late Mughal history. His scholarly approach emphasized empirical evidence over nationalist narratives, producing works that remain foundational for Mughal studies.

## Historical Context

Published in 1919, shortly after World War I and during the height of British colonial rule in India, this work appeared when Indian historians were establishing professional historical scholarship as a discipline. The early twentieth century saw growing interest among Indian intellectuals in recovering and critically examining their own history, partly as a response to colonial narratives that portrayed pre-British India as chaotic or backward. Sarkar's work demonstrated that Indian history could be studied with the same rigor applied to European history, using primary sources and critical methods. His focus on Aurangzeb, often portrayed negatively in both colonial and Hindu nationalist narratives, reflected his commitment to evidence-based history rather than sectarian interpretation. The work contributed to the development of modern Indian historiography, establishing standards for archival research and source criticism.

## Literary and Cultural Significance

Sarkar revolutionized Mughal historical studies by combining rigorous archival research with critical source analysis, demonstrating that Indian history could be studied with the same methodological rigor applied to European history. His mastery of Persian enabled him to access and interpret official Mughal documents that previous historians had overlooked or misunderstood, revealing the sophisticated bureaucratic machinery and administrative rationality underlying Mughal governance. The work's focus on Aurangzeb—often portrayed negatively in both colonial and Hindu nationalist narratives—reflected Sarkar's commitment to evidence-based history rather than sectarian interpretation, presenting nuanced analysis of the emperor's policies and their impacts. Published in 1919 during the height of British colonial rule, the work demonstrated that Indian historians could establish professional historical scholarship, contributing to the development of modern Indian historiography and establishing standards for archival research and source criticism that influenced subsequent generations. The essays remain valuable for understanding Mughal political economy, administrative practices, and the complex relationship between central authority and provincial governance.
