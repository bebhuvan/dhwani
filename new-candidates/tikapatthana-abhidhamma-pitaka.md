# Tikapatthana of the Abhidhamma Pitaka

## Overview

Tikapatthana of the Abhidhamma Pitaka (1921) is the third volume of a critical edition of an important Pali Buddhist commentary work, published by Oxford University Press for the Pali Text Society. This 84-page scholarly edition presents the Tikapatthana, a detailed exegetical commentary on the Abhidhamma Pitaka traditionally attributed to Buddhaghosa. Edited with contributions from Caroline Augusta Foley Rhys Davids, the work represents sophisticated Buddhist philosophical analysis examining the conditioned relationships between mental and physical phenomena according to Theravada scholastic tradition.

## About Buddhaghosa and Caroline Rhys Davids

Buddhaghosa (5th century CE) was the most important philosopher and commentator of the Theravada Buddhist tradition, whose systematic commentaries on the Pali Canon established interpretive frameworks that shaped Theravada Buddhism for subsequent centuries. His works synthesized centuries of Buddhist scholastic thought into comprehensive treatises that remain authoritative in Theravada countries. Caroline Augusta Foley Rhys Davids (d. 1942) was a pioneering British scholar of Buddhism and Pali literature who played a crucial role in the Pali Text Society alongside her husband T.W. Rhys Davids. She was one of the first Western women to achieve prominence in Buddhist studies, producing important translations and scholarly editions while also developing her own interpretive theories about early Buddhism.

## Historical Context

This edition appeared in 1921, during the mature phase of the Pali Text Society's systematic publication of Pali canonical and commentarial literature. Founded in 1881, the Society aimed to make the complete Pali Buddhist canon and its commentaries available to scholars through critical editions. By the 1920s, the Society had published numerous canonical texts and was turning attention to the vast commentarial literature that preserved centuries of Buddhist scholastic thought. The Tikapatthana, as part of the Abhidhamma literature, represented the most philosophically technical dimension of Buddhist thought, and its publication reflected Western scholars' deepening engagement with Buddhist philosophy beyond introductory texts.

## Literary and Cultural Significance

The Tikapatthana belongs to the Abhidhamma Pitaka, the third division of the Pali Canon devoted to systematic philosophical analysis of Buddhist doctrine. This commentarial literature examines the complex causal relationships (paṭṭhāna) between mental and physical phenomena, developing elaborate taxonomies of consciousness, mental factors, and material elements. The Abhidhamma tradition represents Theravada Buddhism's contribution to systematic philosophy, providing frameworks for understanding consciousness, causation, and the mechanics of karma and rebirth. Buddhaghosa's commentaries on these texts synthesized earlier interpretive traditions and remain foundational for Theravada philosophical education. The Pali Text Society's publication of works like the Tikapatthana made this sophisticated philosophical literature accessible to Western scholars, contributing to recognition of Buddhism as a philosophical system comparable in rigor to Western philosophy. This volume remains valuable for specialists in Buddhist philosophy and Abhidhamma studies.
