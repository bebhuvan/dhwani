# The Saddharma-pundarîka; or, The Lotus of the True Law

## Overview

The Lotus of the True Law (1884) presents Hendrik Kern's landmark English translation of the Saddharma Puṇḍarīka Sūtra (Lotus Sutra), published by Oxford's Clarendon Press. This 548-page translation draws from Sanskrit manuscript Add. 1682 held in Cambridge University Library, making one of Mahayana Buddhism's most venerated texts accessible to Western readers. The sutra presents revolutionary teachings on universal Buddhahood potential, the eternal nature of the Buddha, and upaya (skillful means) through parables like the Burning House and the Prodigal Son, cosmic visions, and dramatic narratives that have profoundly influenced East Asian Buddhist thought and practice.

## About Hendrik Kern

Johan Hendrik Caspar Kern (1833-1917) was a distinguished Dutch linguist and Orientalist who specialized in Sanskrit, Pali, and comparative Indo-European philology. As Professor of Sanskrit at Leiden University, Kern produced groundbreaking work on Indian Buddhist texts and Hindu epics. His scholarly expertise in Sanskrit enabled him to navigate the complex philosophical and literary dimensions of the Lotus Sutra, producing a translation that balanced academic rigor with accessibility. Kern's contributions to Buddhist studies extended beyond translation to include critical studies of Buddhist literature and Indian linguistic history, establishing him as one of the foremost European scholars of Indian religions in the nineteenth century.

## Historical Context

Kern's translation appeared in 1884 during a period of intense European scholarly engagement with Buddhist texts, particularly those of the Mahayana tradition. Unlike earlier work that focused primarily on Pali texts of Theravada Buddhism, Kern's translation of the Lotus Sutra opened Western scholarship to the philosophical and literary richness of Mahayana scriptures. The late nineteenth century saw European scholars gaining access to Sanskrit Buddhist manuscripts preserved in Nepal, Tibet, and Central Asian sites, revealing the diversity of Buddhist traditions. This translation made one of East Asian Buddhism's most important texts accessible to Western readers and scholars, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of Buddhist thought beyond the Theravada tradition.

## Literary and Cultural Significance

The Lotus Sutra introduced doctrinal innovations that transformed Mahayana Buddhism: the concept that all beings possess Buddha-nature and can attain enlightenment (not just monastics), the eternal Buddha who transcends historical Shakyamuni, and the doctrine that diverse Buddhist teachings represent skillful adaptations to varying capacities rather than contradictions. These ideas became foundational to major East Asian schools including Chinese Tiantai, Japanese Nichiren, and various Pure Land traditions. The sutra's literary form—combining philosophical exposition with vivid parables, cosmic imagery, and dramatic narratives—influenced Buddhist art, ritual, and literature throughout East Asia. Kern's translation provided Western scholars with access to this crucial text, enabling comparative religious studies and contributing to Western recognition of Mahayana Buddhism's philosophical sophistication and diversity beyond Theravada tradition. The work remains an important historical translation, though later scholarship has produced additional English versions drawing on Chinese and Tibetan sources alongside Sanskrit.
