# వెలుగోటివారివంశావళి (Velugoti Vari Vamsavali)

## Overview

The Velugoti Vari Vamsavali chronicles the Velugoti family, a powerful Velama warrior clan that served the Kakatiya dynasty and later became independent chiefs in coastal Andhra Pradesh. Written by N. Venkata Ramanaiah in Telugu (1939), this vamsavali (dynastic genealogy) preserves crucial details about a militarily significant lineage during the turbulent post-Kakatiya period (13th-15th centuries).

The text documents military campaigns, territorial conflicts with Reddi kingdoms, and the complex relationship between regional chiefs and the Vijayanagara empire during the fragmentation of the Deccan. Written in traditional verse-and-prose format by family bards, it provides regional perspective on medieval eastern Deccan political dynamics rarely found in pan-Indian histories. Essential for understanding Velama community history and Andhra's medieval political landscape. Available through Archive.org (DLI collection), public domain.
