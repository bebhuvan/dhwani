# Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra

## Overview

The Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra is one of Mahāyāna Buddhism's most philosophically sophisticated texts, central to the Yogācāra (Mind-Only) school and profoundly influential on Zen Buddhism. This 1923 Sanskrit edition edited by Bunyiu Nanjio (Central Library, Baroda) represents early 20th-century Buddhist textual scholarship making this crucial text accessible to scholars.

## Content & Significance

The sutra presents the doctrine of cittamātra (consciousness-only reality), ālayavijñāna (storehouse consciousness containing karmic seeds), and tathāgata-garbha (innate Buddha-nature). Through dialogues between Buddha and Rāvaṇa, it develops complex philosophical arguments about perception, reality's nature, and paths to enlightenment. Essential for understanding Mahayana scholastic philosophy and the philosophical foundations of Zen practice. This 1923 edition predates most Western scholarly engagement. Available through Archive.org, public domain.
