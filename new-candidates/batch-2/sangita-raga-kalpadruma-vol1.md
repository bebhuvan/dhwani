# Saṅgīta Rāga-kalpadruma Vol. 1

## Overview

The Saṅgīta Rāga-kalpadruma by Krishnananda Vyasadeva Ragasagara (1914) is a comprehensive 736-page technical encyclopedia of ragas, organized metaphorically as a "kalpadruma" (wish-fulfilling tree). This systematic catalog provides practitioners with detailed technical specifications for numerous classical ragas.

For each raga documented (including Shrirag, Titala, Dhinal, Gouri, Dhamar, and many others), the text provides complete lakshanas (defining characteristics): precise svara sequences (notes used), aroha-avaroha patterns (ascending and descending note progressions), vadi-samvadi (principal and secondary notes), pakad (characteristic phrases), time of performance (prahar), and rasa (aesthetic mood). This level of systematic technical detail makes it an invaluable reference for musicians needing authoritative specifications beyond what oral transmission alone provides. Essential for understanding the precise grammatical rules governing raga structure in classical tradition. Available through Archive.org (DLI collection), public domain.
