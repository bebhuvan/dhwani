# Saṅgīta-makaranda (Essence of Music)

## Overview

The Saṅgīta-makaranda is a Sanskrit musicological treatise edited/translated by Mangesh Ramakrishna Telang (1920), belonging to the medieval tradition of sangita shastra (science of music). As a technical manual rather than modern historical survey, it systematically covers foundational concepts of classical Indian music theory essential for practitioners.

Content includes detailed treatment of ragas (melodic frameworks with specific note sequences, aesthetic moods, and performance rules), talas (complex rhythmic cycle systems), svara theory (musical notes and their relationships), and the technical apparatus underlying Hindustani classical music. The text preserves ancient knowledge systems transmitted through practitioner lineages, documenting theoretical foundations that guide performance practice. Essential for understanding the systematic theoretical basis of Indian classical music beyond purely performative aspects. Available through Archive.org (DLI collection), public domain.
