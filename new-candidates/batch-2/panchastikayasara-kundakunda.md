# Pañcāstikāyasāra (Essence of Five Extended Substances)

## Overview

The Pañcāstikāyasāra is one of Acharya Kundakunda's (c. 2nd century CE) three major philosophical works explaining fundamental Jain metaphysics. This 274-page 1920 edition (Kumar Devendra Prasad, Arrah) from the Sacred Books of the Jainas series presents the original Prakrit gāthas with Sanskrit chhāya rendering, making it accessible to Sanskrit scholars while preserving the original verses.

## Content & Significance

Explains the five astikāyas (extended substances forming reality): jīva (soul), pudgala (matter), dharma (medium of motion), adharma (medium of rest), and ākāśa (space). Kundakunda's distinctive mystical approach emphasizes the crucial distinction between absolute perspective (niścaya naya) viewing soul's pure nature and conventional perspective (vyavahāra naya) dealing with empirical reality. While revered in Jain circles, Kundakunda remains understudied outside specialist scholarship. Essential for Digambara Jain metaphysics and understanding Jain ontology. Available through Archive.org (DLI collection), public domain.
