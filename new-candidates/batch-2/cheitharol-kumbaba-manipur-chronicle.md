# Cheitharol Kumbaba (Royal Chronicle of Manipur)

## Overview

The Cheitharol Kumbaba is the official royal chronicle of the Meitei kings of Manipurâ€”equivalent to Assamese Buranjis or Burmese Yazawins. This 722-page edition edited by Lairenmayum Ibungohal Singh (1969) documents the Ningthouja dynasty from legendary king Nongda Lairen Pakhangba (traditional date 33 CE) through 76 successive rulers until 1955, recording court events, military campaigns, religious changes, and administrative developments.

Crucial historical periods covered include King Kiyamba's reign (1467-1508) when systematic chronicle-keeping was adopted from the Shans, the transformative introduction of Vaishnavism under Charairongba (1697-1709) which reshaped Meitei religious identity, conflicts with Burma, and 19th-century British intervention. Written in Manipuri (Meitei), it represents one of Northeast India's most important indigenous historical sources, providing insider perspective on a kingdom that maintained independence until 1891. Essential for Manipur history, religious transformation studies, and understanding indigenous chronicle traditions. Available through Archive.org (DLI collection), public domain.
