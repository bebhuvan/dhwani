# Tattvakaumudi (Moonlight of Principles)

## Overview

The Tattvakaumudi is Vacaspatimisra's magisterial 10th-century commentary on Ishvarakrishna's Sankhyakarika, the classic 70-verse exposition of Sankhya philosophy. This 1896 English translation by the renowned Sanskrit scholar Ganganatha Jha (published by Bombay Theosophical Publication Fund) made this essential philosophical text accessible to Western scholarship and modern Indian readers.

## Historical Context

Vacaspatimisra (c. 950 CE) was one of medieval India's most prolific and influential philosophers, writing authoritative commentaries on texts from multiple schools including Advaita Vedanta, Nyaya, Sankhya, and Yoga. His Tattvakaumudi represents the mature medieval articulation of classical Sankhya, defending its positions against Buddhist, Vedantic, and other rival philosophical challenges that had emerged over centuries of debate.

## Content

**Metaphysical Framework**: Explicates Sankhya's fundamental dualism between:
- Purusha: Pure consciousness, eternal, inactive, multiple souls
- Prakriti: Primordial matter, active, consisting of three gunas (sattva, rajas, tamas)

**Cosmological Evolution**: Systematically explains the evolution (parinama) of 25 tattvas (principles) from prakriti:
- Mahat (cosmic intelligence), ahamkara (ego-principle)
- Five tanmatras (subtle elements)
- Five mahabhutas (gross elements)
- Eleven indriyas (sense and action organs) plus manas (mind)

**Theory of Causation**: Defends satkaryavada (effect pre-exists in cause) against Buddhist momentariness and Nyaya-Vaisheshika asatkaryavada (effect is newly produced).

**Liberation (Kaivalya)**: Explains how discriminative knowledge (viveka-jnana) between purusha and prakriti leads to isolation of consciousness from matter, resulting in liberation.

**Polemical Defense**: Addresses objections from Buddhist epistemologists, Vedantins, and other schools, defending Sankhya's atheistic metaphysics and realist ontology.

## Significance

**Philosophical**: The Tattvakaumudi became the standard commentary on Sankhyakarika, superseding earlier commentaries through its systematic rigor and comprehensive treatment. It represents Sankhya at its philosophical zenith before the school's gradual decline in later centuries.

**Historical**: Documents the sophisticated state of Indian philosophical debate in the 10th century, showing how schools engaged with each other's arguments and refined their positions through centuries of dialectical exchange.

**Influence**: While Sankhya as an independent school eventually declined, its metaphysical categories and concepts profoundly influenced Yoga philosophy, Vedanta, and various Tantric traditions. Vacaspatimisra's exposition remained the authoritative interpretation.

**Translation Significance**: Ganganatha Jha's 1896 English translation marked an important moment in making classical Indian philosophy accessible to comparative philosophy and facilitated serious Western engagement with Sankhya thought.
