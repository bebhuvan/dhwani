## ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### Data Quality Issues (to flag for Phase 1 correction):
1. **Genre:** "C-DAK" appears to be data error (should be Buddhist Literature)
2. **Genre:** "SV" appears to be data error (should be Ayurvedic Medical Texts)
3. **Genre:** "City" appears to be data error (should be Vedic Literature)
4. **Genre:** "Banasthali" appears to be data error (should be Reference/Linguistics)
5. **Duplicates:** Several files appear to be duplicates with slight name variations

### Recommendations:
- Phase 1D (Genre & Classification Expert) should re-classify these works
- Duplicates should be identified and merged before Phase 3
- Archive.org metadata should be re-checked for these problematic classifications
