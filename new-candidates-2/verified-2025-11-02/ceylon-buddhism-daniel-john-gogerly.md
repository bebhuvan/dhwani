# Ceylon Buddhism: Being the Collected Writings of Daniel John Gogerly

## Overview

Published in 1908, this volume gathers decades of Daniel John Gogerly’s English-language essays on Theravada Buddhism in Sri Lanka. The writings include translations of Pali texts (*Dhammapada*, *Buddhavamsa* extracts), analyses of doctrine (karma, nirvana, the eightfold path), descriptions of rituals (pirit chanting, ordination), and comparative reflections contrasting Buddhist ethics with Christian theology.

## Significance

- Provides an early missionary-scholar perspective on Theravada practice, offering detailed observations of temple life, festival calendars, and monastic education in colonial Ceylon.
- The appended Pali-English glossary and translated passages influenced subsequent Buddhist studies and interfaith dialogue.
- Serves as a historical source documenting nineteenth-century Sinhala Buddhism before twentieth-century reform movements.

## Public Domain Status

Published in 1908, the collection is in the public domain worldwide.
