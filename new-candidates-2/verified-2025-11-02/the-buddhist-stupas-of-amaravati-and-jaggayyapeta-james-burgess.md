# The Buddhist Stupas of Amaravati and Jaggayyapeta

## Overview

This richly illustrated ASI publication catalogues sculptures, architectural fragments, and inscriptions from the Buddhist stupas at Amaravati (Andhra Pradesh) and Jaggayyapeta. Burgess contextualises the monuments within Satavahana and Ikshvaku history, describing the structural remains, railing elements, and narrative panels. Detailed plates reproduce reliefs depicting Jataka stories, Bodhisattva worship, and early Buddhist symbolism.

## Contents

- Site descriptions with plans, measurements, and excavation notes from Colonel Mackenzie and later ASI work.
- Iconographic analysis of relief panels, including the “Great Departure” of Siddhartha, stupas within stupas, and donor processions.
- Transcriptions of Prakrit inscriptions, identifying donors (guilds, merchants, monks) and their geographic spread.
- Appendices on sculptural fragments dispersed to the Madras Museum, British Museum, and Calcutta Museum.

## Significance

The monograph preserves visual and textual data for many sculptures now scattered worldwide, aiding comparative Buddhist art research. It also records the methodological challenges of nineteenth-century excavations and the editorial debates around restoring pieces in museum settings.

## Public Domain Status

Published in 1887, the work is in the public domain worldwide.
