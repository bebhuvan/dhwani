# Outlines of Jainism

## Overview

Published in Allahabad by the Central Jaina Publishing House (1916), Jagomandar Lal Jaini’s *Outlines of Jainism* offers a concise introduction to Jain philosophy for students and comparative religion scholars. Jaini covers Jain metaphysics (jīva and ajīva), karma theory, cosmology, the path of liberation (ratnatraya), ethics, monastic discipline, and sectarian history (Śvetāmbara and Digambara). Chapters conclude with references to canonical texts such as the Tattvārtha Sūtra, Uttarādhyayana, and commentaries by Kundakunda and Hemachandra.

## Highlights

- Clarifies key doctrines like anekāntavāda (many-sidedness), syādvāda (conditional predication), and the seven tattvas with accessible analogies.
- Details ritual practices (samayika, pratikramana), vows for laypeople (aṇuvrata) and monks (mahāvrata), and the Jain calendar of festivals.
- Provides historical sketches of tīrthaṅkaras, Jaina councils, and medieval monastic lineages; includes tables of inscriptions and early Western scholarship.
- Compares Jainism with Buddhism and Brahmanical thought, emphasising Jain contributions to non-violence and vegetarianism.

## Significance

The book became a standard reference for the growing Jaina education movement and for Western universities offering courses on Indian religions. It reflects early twentieth-century Jaina reform efforts to present doctrine in modern prose while remaining grounded in canonical sources.

## Public Domain Status

Published in 1916, the work is in the public domain worldwide.
