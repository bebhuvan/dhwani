# Report of the Indian Universities Commission, 1902

## Overview

Commissioned by Viceroy Lord Curzon and chaired by Sir Thomas Raleigh, the 1902 Indian Universities Commission examined the functioning of the colonial university system—then dominated by affiliating and examining bodies at Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, Allahabad, and Punjab. The report, submitted in 1903, spans university governance, curricula, collegiate inspection, finances, and vernacular instruction. It criticised the purely examining character of the universities, the mushrooming of under-funded affiliated colleges, and the shortfalls in teacher training. Detailed chapters cover each presidency, append statistics on enrolment, exam success rates, college staffing, and expenditure, and tabulate evidence gathered from hundreds of witnesses.

## Key Recommendations

- Reconstitute university senates and syndicates to include more experienced educationists and limit the dominance of lawyers and private examiners.
- Introduce tighter affiliation and inspection standards; empower universities to disaffiliate poorly run colleges.
- Create teaching universities (beginning with Calcutta) with full-time professors, laboratories, and residential halls; establish intermediate colleges under provincial management.
- Reform curricula to emphasise science, technical education, and Indian languages alongside English; overhaul matriculation and B.A. syllabi.
- Provide larger government grants and endowments tied to performance, while encouraging private philanthropy.
- Institute research scholarships, training colleges for teachers, and honours courses to cultivate advanced scholarship.

The Commission’s findings underpinned the Indian Universities Act of 1904, which remodelled university statutes along these lines.

## Historical Context

By the turn of the twentieth century, Indian universities were producing large numbers of B.A. graduates but faced criticism for rote learning and weak quality control. Curzon’s government had already convened provincial education conferences; the commission consolidated evidence from principals, missionaries, Indian reformers, and students. Although the report’s centralising tone drew nationalist criticism, it documented the state of higher education just before the swadeshi agitation.

## Public Domain Status

As a colonial government publication first issued in 1903, the report is in the public domain worldwide.
