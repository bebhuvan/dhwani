# Toba Tek Singh

## Overview

First published in 1955, Manto’s short story centres on Bishan Singh, a Sikh inmate in a Lahore mental asylum who struggles to understand the partition of India. As officials prepare to exchange inmates between India and Pakistan, the story exposes the absurdity and human cost of political borders.

## Significance

*Toba Tek Singh* is considered a masterwork of Urdu partition literature, encapsulating trauma, displacement, and political satire in a concise narrative. It has been translated widely and adapted for film and theatre, remaining essential reading for postcolonial studies.

## Public Domain Status

Manto died in 1955; his works entered the Indian public domain on 1 January 2016 (life+60). This story is therefore in the public domain in India. (Check target jurisdiction before reuse.)
