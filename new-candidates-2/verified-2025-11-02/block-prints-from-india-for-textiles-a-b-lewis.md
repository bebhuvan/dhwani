# Block Prints from India for Textiles

## Overview

Part of the Field Museum’s Anthropology series, this 1924 catalogue documents a collection of Indian block-printed textiles acquired for design study. Lewis classifies samples by region (Rajasthan, Gujarat, Punjab, Bengal), fabric type, dye technique (madder, indigo, resist), and motif. High-resolution plates reproduce the patterns, accompanied by measurements and descriptions of block carving methods.

## Highlights

- Explains the multi-block printing process, mordant and resist applications, and finishing techniques like chaupadi and kalamkari.
- Discusses artisan communities (Chhipa, Khatri) and trade networks supplying textiles to African, Middle Eastern, and Southeast Asian markets.
- Provides design analysts with pattern repeats, colour palettes, and geometry breakdowns, inspiring early twentieth-century American textile designers.

## Significance

The catalogue remains a valuable resource for historians studying Indian textile production, global trade, and design diffusion. Contemporary designers mine the patterns for revivals, while conservationists refer to the technical notes when preserving vintage fabrics.

## Public Domain Status

Published in 1924, the catalogue is in the public domain worldwide.
