# Samskriti Sangam (संस्कृति संगम)

## Overview

Originally delivered as lectures at Santiniketan and later published by Sahitya Bhavan (Allahabad) in 1951, *Samskriti Sangam* presents Sen’s reflections on India’s "cultural confluence". Essays examine the Upanishads’ ethical humanism, Buddhist compassion, the Bhakti movement’s egalitarian impulse, Sikh synthesis, and Mughal-era Sufi-humanist encounters. Sen highlights how shared ideas—ahimsa, prema, seva—created a composite civilisation.

## About the Author

Kshitimohan Sen (1880–1960) served as Acharya of Visva-Bharati’s Vidya Bhavana and was a key interpreter of Indian mysticism. Fluent in Sanskrit, Bengali, Hindi, and Persian, he worked to make classical texts approachable for modern readers and to foreground the pluralist roots of Indian spirituality.

## Historical Context

Published shortly after independence, the volume responds to communal tensions and language politics by demonstrating precedents for harmony. Sen references his fieldwork among sants and fakirs and uses comparative philology to show continuity between ancient scripture and contemporary devotional practice. The work entered the Indian public domain on 1 January 2021; U.S. copyright persists until 2046 under Uruguay Round rules.

## Literary & Cultural Significance

- **Pluralist argument:** Provides documentary evidence that Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Sikh, and Muslim traditions cross-fertilised Indian ethical thought.
- **Pedagogical tone:** Written in lucid Hindi for students and lay readers, bridging scholarship and public discourse.
- **Visva-Bharati mission:** Embodies Tagore’s project of cultural synthesis and inter-Asian dialogue.
