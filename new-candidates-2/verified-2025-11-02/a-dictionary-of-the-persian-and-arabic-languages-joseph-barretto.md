# A Dictionary of the Persian and Arabic Languages

## Overview

Published in Calcutta in 1804 by East India Company officer Joseph Barretto, this two-volume dictionary was designed for Company officials, translators, and scholars dealing with Persian and Arabic terms encountered in revenue, judicial, and diplomatic records. Entries present the Persian or Arabic headword in Perso-Arabic script and roman transliteration, followed by concise English definitions. Barretto annotates idioms, compound expressions, and references to Qur’anic or Persian literary usage, making the work a practical bridge between Indo-Persian chancery language and English.

## Features

- Includes administrative terminology from the Diwan, Faujdari, and judicial departments, reflecting vocabulary encountered in sanad, farman, and revenue documents.
- Provides synonyms and cross-references to related words, aiding learners in navigating nuanced distinctions (e.g., between various types of land grants, taxes, or court titles).
- Notes pronunciation variants used in Hindustani, Bengali, and Marathi contexts, acknowledging the multilingual environment of early nineteenth-century India.
- Supplements core entries with appendices on numerals, measures, and Persian letter-writing conventions.

## Historical Significance

The dictionary illustrates the linguistic demands placed on Company servants after the 1793 Permanent Settlement, when Persian still dominated courts and revenue offices. It predates the transition to English in 1837 and captures the living Indo-Persian idiom that underpinned Mughal and Company governance. Modern historians and philologists still consult Barretto’s work to parse Persian documentary vocabulary.

## Public Domain Status

Published in 1804, the dictionary is in the public domain worldwide.
