# Buddha Charit, Vol. 1 (বুদ্ধ চরিত, প্রথম খণ্ড)

## Overview

Prepared at Santiniketan and published in 1944, Rathindranath Tagore’s translation covers cantos 1–14 of Aśvaghoṣa’s *Buddhacarita*, narrating the Buddha’s birth, youth, renunciation, and enlightenment. Tagore renders the Sanskrit mahākāvya into supple Bengali prose interspersed with verse. The edition includes a substantial foreword situating Buddhism within the Visva-Bharati ethos and annotates philosophical terms for students.

## About the Translator

Rathindranath Tagore (1888–1961), Rabindranath’s eldest son, was a scientist, educationist, and the first acharya (principal) of Visva-Bharati. His interest in Buddhist philosophy led him to organise Pali classes and invite scholars such as B. M. Barua to Santiniketan. This translation formed part of the university’s outreach series.

## Historical Context

The 1940s saw renewed Bengali engagement with Buddhism, partly through Mahabodhi Society networks and Visva-Bharati’s Asian cultural exchanges. The translation coincided with wartime humanitarian efforts and Santiniketan’s emphasis on pan-Asian solidarity. Rathindranath died in 1961, placing the work in the Indian public domain from 1 January 2022; URAA restoration keeps the 1944 edition under U.S. copyright until 2039.

## Literary & Cultural Significance

- **Educational resource:** Served Visva-Bharati’s comparative religion courses and influenced Bengali Buddhist studies.
- **Linguistic adaptation:** Balances fidelity to Sanskrit compounds with accessible Bengali, providing glosses for technical terms like *pratītya-samutpāda* and *śīla*.
- **Pan-Asian vision:** Embodies the Tagore family’s attempts to align Santiniketan with pan-Asian spiritual humanism.
