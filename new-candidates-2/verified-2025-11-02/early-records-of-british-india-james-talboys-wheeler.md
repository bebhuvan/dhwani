# Early Records of British India

## Overview

Wheeler reconstructs the beginnings of English power in India from the arrival of the East India Company (1600) through the mid-eighteenth century. Drawing on factory diaries, correspondence, and official charters, he narrates the establishment of trading posts in Surat, Madras, Bombay, and Calcutta, relations with Mughal authorities, naval encounters with the Dutch and Portuguese, and the diplomatic crises leading up to Plassey.

## Significance

- Provides a contemporaneous Victorian synthesis of archival materials, many of which have since dispersed across repositories.
- Offers insight into Company governance, revenue experiments, and the everyday life of merchants and factors.
- Serves as a baseline narrative for scholars comparing British, Dutch, and French colonial strategies in the Indian Ocean.

## Public Domain Status

Published in 1878, the work is in the public domain worldwide.
