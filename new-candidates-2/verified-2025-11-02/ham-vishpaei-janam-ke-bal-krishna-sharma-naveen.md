# Ham Vishpaei Janam Ke (हम विषपायी जन्म के)

## Overview

Edited by his literary executors after his death, this volume gathers Naveen’s poems written during incarceration and after release from British prisons. The title poem declares the responsibility of a generation "poison-fed from birth" to purge colonial subjugation. Other sequences commemorate martyrs, workers, and women who sustained the freedom struggle, blending fiery rhetoric with tender lyricism.

## About the Author

Bal Krishna Sharma ‘Naveen’ (1897–1960) was a Hindi poet, journalist, and parliamentarian aligned with the Indian National Congress. Known for oratory and verse that stirred mass rallies, he also translated world poetry into Hindi and edited the journal *Prabha*.

## Historical Context

The poems were penned between the Civil Disobedience movement and the Quit India uprising, often smuggled out of prisons such as Bareilly and Lalitpur. They reflect hunger strikes, jail camaraderie, and the post-war struggle to translate freedom into social justice. The author’s death in 1960 renders the collection public domain in India from 2021; its 1946 publication lies within the U.S. public domain (pre-1964 without renewal).

## Literary & Cultural Significance

- **Freedom poetry:** Captures the emotional vocabulary of India’s independence movement, frequently recited at rallies and student gatherings.
- **Blend of lyric and speech:** Naveen’s command of chaste Hindi and rhetorical flourishes exemplifies the era’s nationalism-inflected poetics.
- **Historical document:** Offers firsthand testimony of prison life, colonial repression, and hopes for a just republic.
