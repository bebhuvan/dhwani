# The Textile Manufactures and the Costumes of the People of India

## Overview

Prepared for the India Museum in London, Watson’s volume catalogues textile specimens collected across British India for display at the 1862 International Exhibition. It classifies fabrics by region and technique—cotton, silk, wool, brocade, shawl, printed, embroidered—explaining raw materials, dyes, and production centres. Plates illustrate representative garments and patterns, while appendices list the 700+ samples that accompanied the text volumes.

## Highlights

- Describes weaving centres such as Benares (silk brocades), Dhaka (muslin), Kanchipuram (silk saris), Kashmir (shawls), and Surat (gold thread work).
- Discusses social usage of garments (sari drapes, turban styles, caste-specific attire) and seasonal variations.
- Analyses trade routes linking Indian textiles to European markets and the impacts of industrial competition.

## Significance

The book served as a technical manual for textile manufacturers and designers seeking inspiration from Indian motifs during the Arts and Crafts movement. It also documents artisanal practices that later decline, making it valuable to historians and revivalists.

## Public Domain Status

Published in 1866, the work is in the public domain worldwide.
