# Ranjan (ৰঞ্জন)

## Overview

*Ranjan* first appeared in book form from Samya Press, Calcutta, in 1927. Set against the backdrop of the Jonaki literary movement, the novel follows educated Assamese youth as they negotiate questions of marriage, caste reform, rural indebtedness, and participation in the nascent nationalist public sphere. Barua writes in plain Assamese prose enlivened by lyric passages, weaving letters, diary entries, and village dialogues to show how romantic aspiration collides with colonial bureaucracy and patriarchal expectations.

## About the Author

Chandradhar Barua (1874–1961) was a leading figure in Assamese modernism. A founding member of the Asam Sahitya Sabha and an editor of the magazine *Jonaki*, he used fiction to articulate liberal reformist ideas—promoting women’s education, challenging dowry practices, and idealising rural co-operatives. His writing helped establish the Assamese novel as a vehicle for social debate.

## Historical Context

The Jonaki era (1890s–1930s) saw Assamese writers absorb European romanticism while responding to local social crises. Published at the cusp of Gandhi’s Civil Disobedience movement, *Ranjan* captures a region balancing between colonial administration and vernacular revival. Barua died in 1961, so the novel entered the Indian public domain on 1 January 2022. As a 1927 Indian publication, it is also in the public domain in the United States.

## Literary & Cultural Significance

- **Modern Assamese prose:** Demonstrates how Jonaki writers adapted European realist techniques to Assamese milieu without abandoning lyrical cadence.
- **Social reform narrative:** Critiques patriarchal customs and caste rigidity while advocating co-operative economics and rural uplift.
- **Regional archive:** Provides historians with depictions of Assamese middle-class life, village courts, and emerging nationalist associations during the late colonial period.
