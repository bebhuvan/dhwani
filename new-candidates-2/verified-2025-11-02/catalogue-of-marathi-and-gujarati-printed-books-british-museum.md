# Catalogue of Marathi and Gujarati Printed Books

## Overview

Prepared by librarian J. F. Blumhardt, this 1915 volume catalogues the British Museum’s holdings of Marathi and Gujarati printed books up to the early twentieth century. Entries provide uniform transliteration, original-script titles, authors, places of publication, dates, format, pagination, and brief subject notes. Separate alphabetical sequences are maintained for Marathi and Gujarati, followed by indexes of personal names and subjects.

## Highlights

- Chronicles the output of pioneering presses at Bombay, Poona, Ahmedabad, and Baroda, including missionary tracts, educational textbooks, theatre scripts, devotional literature, gazetteers, and scientific manuals.
- Records rare first editions of figures such as Vishnushastri Chiplunkar, Jyotiba Phule, Narayan Meghaji Lokhande, Narmad, and Govardhanram Tripathi.
- Notes bilingual and trilingual works, Sanskrit commentaries printed with Marathi or Gujarati annotations, and early newspapers like *Dnyanodaya* and *Mumbai Samachar*.

## Research Value

The catalogue remains a foundational reference for scholars tracking the bibliography of western Indian print culture, helping identify surviving copies, variant spellings, and publishing histories. It complements the South Asia bibliographies produced by the India Office Library and the Asiatic Society and assists libraries planning digitisation priorities.

## Public Domain Status

Published in London in 1915, this catalogue is in the public domain worldwide.
