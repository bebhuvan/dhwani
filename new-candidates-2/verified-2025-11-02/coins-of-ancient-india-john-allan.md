# Catalogue of the Coins of Ancient India

## Overview

John Allan systematises the British Museum’s collections of Indian coinage prior to the Islamic period, covering punch-marked issues, tribal republic coins, Indo-Greek and Indo-Scythian series, Satavahana, Gupta, and post-Gupta dynasties. Detailed catalogue entries describe legends, iconography, metal, weight, and provenance. Fifty-one plates reproduce obverse and reverse images of representative specimens.

## Significance

- Remains a foundational reference for numismatists studying pre-medieval Indian monetary systems.
- Allan’s typologies and cross-references to hoard finds and earlier scholarship continue to inform research on chronology and trade networks.
- Provides high-quality images invaluable for authentication and comparative analysis.

## Public Domain Status

Published in 1936, the volume is in the public domain in India (author d.1950) and the United States (pre-1964 without renewal).
