# Bobbili Yuddha Natakamu (బొబ్బిలి యుద్ధ నాటకము)

## Overview

Divided into five acts, the play dramatises the assault on the Bobbili fort by the Vizianagaram army aided by the French general Bussy. Sastry combines kavya metres with Yakshagana-style songs, staging crucial moments such as Rani Mallamma Devi’s self-sacrifice, Tandra Paparayudu’s vengeance, and the battlefield debate on dharma between commanders. The script provides cues for music and chorus, reflecting the performance conventions of coastal Andhra amateur troupes of the 1920s.

## About the Author

Sripada Krishnamurty Sastry (1866–1960) served as poet laureate of the Bobbili estate and was conferred the title “Kavi Sarvabhauma”. His historical and mythological dramas raised patriotic sentiment while enriching Telugu prosody and stagecraft. He mentored theatre companies that popularised spoken Telugu dialogue on stage.

## Historical Context

The Bobbili legend symbolised defiance against colonial and feudal domination. By retelling it during the Non-Cooperation era, Sastry encouraged nationalist pride and valorised martyrs. Because Sastry died in 1960, the play has been in the Indian public domain since 2021; its 1922 Indian publication date places it in the U.S. public domain as well.

## Literary & Cultural Significance

- **Regional memory:** Canonical source for the Bobbili story, influencing later films, novels, and school textbooks.
- **Performance template:** Offers researchers insight into how early twentieth-century Telugu theatre integrated poetry, music, and dance.
- **Patriotic pedagogy:** Reinforced ideals of courage, loyalty, and self-sacrifice for audiences engaged in anti-colonial politics.
