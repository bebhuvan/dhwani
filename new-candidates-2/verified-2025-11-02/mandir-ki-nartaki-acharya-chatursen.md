# Mandir Ki Nartaki (मन्दिर की नर्तकी)

## Overview

Set in a fictionalised medieval Rajput polity, *Mandir Ki Nartaki* follows the dancer Chandrarekha, adopted daughter of wealthy merchant Dhananjay Seth. As politics shift between Buddhist monastic orders and royal patrons, Chandrarekha navigates questions of duty, agency, and spiritual liberation. The narrative interweaves temple ceremonies, merchant guild intrigue, and the arrival of bhikkhu Bandhugupta’s Sangha.

## About the Author

Acharya Chatursen Shastri (1891–1960) was a prolific Hindi novelist known for blending archival research with dramatic storytelling. His works—*Vaishali ki Nagarvadhu*, *Someru*, *Vayam Rakshamah*—reconstructed ancient Indian history for popular readers, often foregrounding marginalised figures such as courtesans or soldiers.

## Historical Context

Written on the eve of World War II, the novel reflects nationalist interest in revisiting India’s pre-Islamic past and critiquing social hierarchies. Chatursen reimagines Buddhist decline and caste rigidity, inviting comparisons with contemporary reform debates. The author died in 1960, so the novel is public domain in India since 2021; its 1939 publication is also public domain in the United States.

## Literary & Cultural Significance

- **Gendered perspective:** Presents temple heritage through the eyes of a female performer negotiating spirituality and autonomy.
- **Historical imagination:** Combines epigraphic references with fictional episodes, influencing later adaptations in theatre and film.
- **Ethical critique:** Questions orthodoxy, materialism, and the commodification of devotion—issues resonant with modern readers.
