# Sahitya Ka Itihas-Darshan (साहित्य का इतिहास-दर्शन)

## Overview

Published by Rajkamal Prakashan in 1960, *Sahitya Ka Itihas-Darshan* lays out Sharma’s method for writing Hindi literary history. Rejecting purely chronological catalogues, he emphasises the interplay of rasa theory, linguistic change, and material conditions. Chapters analyse Bhakti, Riti, Chhayavād, and Pragativād movements, juxtaposing close readings with broader philosophical reflections on time, tradition, and the reader’s role.

## About the Author

Nalin Vilochan Sharma (1916–1961) taught at Patna University and championed the Nakenwad (“new contemplation”) approach to criticism. He advocated stylistic analysis and interdisciplinary study, influencing post-independence Hindi departments across North India.

## Historical Context

The book emerged amid debates about codifying Hindi syllabi after independence. Sharma’s arguments push back against nationalist teleologies, calling for plural histories attentive to regional and class distinctions. Sharma’s death in 1961 places the work in the Indian public domain from 2022; Uruguay Round rules keep the 1960 edition under U.S. copyright until 2055.

## Literary & Cultural Significance

- **Methodological intervention:** Provides one of the earliest Hindi-language engagements with historicism, reader-response, and comparative poetics.
- **Curricular impact:** Shaped university courses on Hindi criticism during the 1960s–70s.
- **Bridge text:** Connects classical Sanskrit aesthetics with modern literary theory, encouraging critics to read Hindi literature transhistorically.
