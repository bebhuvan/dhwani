# Catalogue of the Library of the India Office (Volume II, Part 4)

## Overview

This 1905 catalogue volume inventories the Marathi and Gujarati holdings of the India Office Library in London, covering manuscripts, printed books, periodicals, and government publications. Entries note shelfmarks, titles in original scripts with roman transliteration, authorship, physical description, and provenance. Numerous items carry administrative annotations indicating acquisition through the East India Company, private donations, or purchase from Indian booksellers.

## Scope

- **Manuscripts:** devotional literature (Abhangas, Kirtans), Peshwa correspondence, court chronicles, Jain scriptures, medical treatises, and astrological works.
- **Printed books:** early Bombay and Poona imprints, missionary translations, educational primers, dictionaries, and newspapers (*Dnyanodaya*, *Kesari*).
- **Official publications:** Bombay Presidency reports, gazetteers, revenue manuals, and vernacular acts.

## Research Utility

The catalogue provides scholars with a roadmap to western India’s literary heritage preserved in Britain. Its shelfmarks remain standard references for requesting materials in the British Library’s Asian and African Studies Reading Room, supporting studies in Marathi bhakti, Gujarati reform movements, and colonial administration.

## Public Domain Status

Published in 1905, the catalogue is in the public domain worldwide.
