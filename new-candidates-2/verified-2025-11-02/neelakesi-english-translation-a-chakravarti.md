# Neelakesi

## Overview

Professor A. Chakravarti’s translation introduces Anglophone readers to the Jain heroine Neelakesi, whose debates with Saivite ascetic Kovalan dramatise classical Tamil interfaith arguments. The bilingual edition prints romanised Tamil alongside English prose, annotating doctrinal positions, metre, and mythic geography.

## About the Translator

Chakravarti (1892–1957) served on the faculty of Madras Christian College and devoted his scholarship to Jain Tamil texts. His translations and commentaries opened a neglected corpus to universities and comparative religionists.

## Historical Context

Appearing during the Tamil renaissance of the 1930s, the book answered calls to document Jain contributions to Tamil heritage. It leverages manuscripts from Jain mutts and references to epigraphs. Chakravarti’s death in 1957 places the translation in the Indian public domain from 2018; as an Indian work published in 1936, it is also public domain in the United States.

## Literary & Cultural Significance

- **Doctrinal archive:** Captures Jain-Saivite polemics vital for understanding sectarian discourse in medieval Tamil Nadu.
- **Critical framework:** Provides introductions, glossaries, and comparative notes that aid present-day researchers.
- **Preservation:** Supports digital and philological projects by supplying a clear transliteration of a rare Tamil epic.
