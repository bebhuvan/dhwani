# A Digest of Hindu Law of Inheritance, Partition and Adoption

## Overview

This authoritative digest collects the leading precedents on Hindu inheritance, partition, and adoption decided by the High Courts (especially Bombay) and the Privy Council up to the 1880s. Sir Raymond West, Chief Justice of the Bombay High Court, and registrar J. R. Garth organise judgments thematically, summarise facts, state legal propositions, and cross-reference Sanskrit sources such as the Mitākṣarā, Dāyabhāga, and Smṛti Chandrikā. Each proposition is accompanied by case citations and notes on regional differences between the Bombay, Madras, Bengal, and North-Western Provinces schools of law.

## Structure

- **Inheritance:** legitimacy, succession of daughters, widows, and collateral heirs; stridhan categories; disqualifications (religious conversion, disability).
- **Partition:** coparcenary rights, severance procedures, allotment of shares, treatment of self-acquired versus ancestral property, and rights of illegitimate offspring.
- **Adoption:** validity of adoption ceremonies, widow’s power to adopt, dattaka versus kritrima adoption, and the legal effect on inheritance.
- **Appendices:** translations of key Sanskrit passages, tables of disputed verses, and chronological lists of reported cases.

## Historical Importance

The digest became a standard reference for colonial courts and Indian lawyers navigating the hybrid system of Anglo-Hindu law. It illustrates how judges harmonised Sanskrit commentaries with modern jurisprudence and influenced later codification efforts (e.g., the Hindu Women’s Rights to Property Act, 1937). Contemporary researchers use the work to trace doctrinal evolution before post-independence codification.

## Public Domain Status

Published in 1884, the treatise is public domain worldwide.
