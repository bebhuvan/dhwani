# War Without Violence

## Overview

Shridharani systematises Gandhian satyagraha by comparing it with conventional warfare. Drawing on his imprisonment during the Salt March and studies at Columbia University, he articulates principles of nonviolent mobilisation, leadership, discipline, propaganda, and negotiation. Case studies include the Champaran movement, Bardoli satyagraha, and the 1930 Salt March, with strategic analysis of successes and failures.

## Themes

- Nonviolence as an offensive weapon seeking to convert opponents rather than destroy them.
- Importance of organisation, training, and economic boycotts in mass movements.
- Relevance of satyagraha to global struggles (anti-colonial movements, labour strikes).

## Legacy

The book influenced American civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. and remains a key text for activists studying nonviolent strategy.

## Public Domain Status

Krishnalal Shridharani died in 1960; the book entered the Indian public domain on 1 January 2021. It is also in the public domain in the United States (pre-1964 publication without renewal).
