# Charcha Shatak (चर्चा शतक)

## Overview

*Charcha Shatak* compiles one hundred short catechetical chapters covering Jain cosmology, karma theory, monastic discipline, rituals, festivals, and the biographies of tīrthaṅkaras. Each "discussion" is framed as a question-and-answer exchange suitable for lay study circles. Premi also includes glossaries of Prakrit terms, references to canonical texts, and guidance on correct recitation.

## About the Author

Nathuram Premi (1881–1960) was a prominent Jain publisher, writer, and social reformer based in Mumbai. Through the Jain Granth Ratnakar Karyalaya he popularised accessible literature that balanced doctrinal rigor with modern scholarship. His works promoted education, temple preservation, and inter-sectarian understanding.

## Historical Context

The 1920s witnessed Jain community efforts to systematise religious education amid colonial modernity. Premi’s manual addressed urban Jain youth and newly literate devotees, providing standardised lessons for pathshalas and home study. The author’s death in 1960 makes the text public domain in India since 1 January 2021; its 1926 publication date renders it public domain in the United States.

## Literary & Cultural Significance

- **Educational toolkit:** Served as a textbook for Jain schools and community gatherings, preserving doctrinal clarity.
- **Inter-sect bridge:** Quotes Digambara and Śvetāmbara sources, reflecting Premi’s reformist emphasis on unity.
- **Historical snapshot:** Records early twentieth-century practices, including temple management and charitable initiatives, valuable to historians of modern Jainism.
