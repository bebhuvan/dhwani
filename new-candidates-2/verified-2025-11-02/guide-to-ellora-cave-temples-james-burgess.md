# Guide to the Ellora Cave Temples

## Overview

Published by the Archaeological Survey of India in 1926, Burgess’s guidebook synthesises decades of survey work at Ellora. After an introductory history of the Deccan rock-cut tradition, the guide provides detailed descriptions of each cave—numbering, orientation, measurements, iconography, and inscriptions. Plans and elevations accompany the text, helping visitors and scholars navigate the complex’s Buddhist (caves 1–12), Hindu (13–29), and Jain (30–34) phases.

## Highlights

- Discusses the construction history of Kailasa (Cave 16) with references to Rashtrakuta inscriptions, quarrying techniques, and sculptural programmes.
- Analyses stylistic influences from Ajanta, Badami, and Pallava architecture; notes cross-references to Gupta art and contemporaneous temples in central India.
- Records epigraphic data, donor names, and iconographic identifications (e.g., panels of Ravana shaking Kailasa, legends of the Mahabharata, Jain Tirthankaras).
- Provides logistical information for travellers of the era—approach routes from Aurangabad, accommodation, and guide fees.

## Significance

Burgess’s guide served as the primary English-language reference on Ellora for much of the twentieth century, informing conservation work and scholarly debate on Deccan art. Today it remains valuable for its measured drawings and transcriptions of inscriptions that have since deteriorated.

## Public Domain Status

Published in 1926, the work is in the public domain worldwide.
