# Bigyan Prabesh Prarambha (বিজ্ঞান প্রবেশ প্রারম্ভ)

## Overview

Published in September 1949 by Bangiya Bigyan Parishad, *Bigyan Prabesh Prarambha* collects seven short chapters—“Brahmanda”, “Surya o Chandra”, “Saurajagat”, “Prithibi”, “Jib”, and “Bigyan o Bigyani”—that pace out a child’s first encounter with astronomy, geology, and biology (table of contents, Archive scan, ff. 4–5). Bhattacharya balances explanatory prose with everyday analogies: eclipses are read through household shadows, planetary orbits through village fair wheels, and taxonomy through familiar flora. The book’s one-rupee price and plain typography signal its target audience of middle-school readers and rural libraries.

## About the Author

Charu Chandra Bhattacharya (1883–1961) was a teacher, editor, and science populariser closely associated with Jagadish Chandra Bose and the Bengal Science Association. He edited the children’s magazine *Sandesh* during the 1930s and wrote widely used textbooks on natural science. His prose emphasised clarity and curiosity rather than rote memorisation, making him a key figure in Bengali science communication.

## Historical Context

Bangiya Bigyan Parishad founded its publishing wing in the 1940s to supply inexpensive science readers in Bengali. *Bigyan Prabesh Prarambha* sits within that mission, appearing just two years after independence when the new state emphasised scientific temper. Bhattacharya died in 1961, so the book has been in the Indian public domain since 1 January 2022. Under United States copyright restoration rules, the 1949 edition remains protected there until 2044.

## Literary & Cultural Significance

- **Curricular bridge:** The text provided a Bengali-language stepping stone between primary readers and the English-medium science curriculum of secondary schools.
- **Scientific temper:** Emphasises observation, experiment, and scepticism, echoing the post-independence push for rational enquiry voiced by Nehru and the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research.
- **Cultural localisation:** Uses Bengali idiom and examples, reinforcing that scientific ideas are compatible with local knowledge systems rather than imposed abstractions.
