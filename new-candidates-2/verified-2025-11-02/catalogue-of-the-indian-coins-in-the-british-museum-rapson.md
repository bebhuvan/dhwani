# Catalogue of the Indian Coins in the British Museum: Indo-Greek and Indo-Scythian Series

## Overview

Rapson’s catalogue documents the British Museum’s Indo-Greek, Indo-Scythian, and early Kushan coin collections. For each ruler—from Diodotus and Euthydemus to Azes and Kanishka—it lists coin types with obverse/reverse descriptions, legends (Greek and Kharoshthi), weight, diameter, and provenance. Plates reproduce high-quality photographs of representative specimens.

## Features

- Provides historical essays on each dynasty, correlating coin imagery with political events, regnal chronology, and religious affiliations (Buddhist, Shaiva, Hellenistic).
- Includes transliterations and translations of bilingual inscriptions, contributing to the decipherment of Kharoshthi.
- Offers appendices on hoards, metrology, and die-links, enabling researchers to trace circulation networks across Gandhara, Bactria, and northwestern India.

## Significance

The catalogue remains a key reference for scholars studying Indo-Greek history, Hellenistic influence in South Asia, and the development of Kushan coinage. Its systematic organisation informed later works by Bopearachchi, Senior, and modern numismatic databases.

## Public Domain Status

Published in 1908, the catalogue is in the public domain worldwide.
