# Chalantika: Adhunik Bangabhashar Abhidhan

## Overview

First published by M. C. Sarkar & Sons in 1937, *Chalantika* standardised modern Bengali usage during a period of orthographic reform. Entries provide etymology (Sanskrit, Arabic-Persian, English), pronunciation guidance, grammatical gender, plural formation, verb conjugations, and notes on acceptable spelling variations. Basu also flags colloquial and "incorrect" forms, reflecting debates about shuddha versus chalita bhasha.

## About the Author

Rajshekhar Basu (1880–1960), famous for his Parashuram satires, was also an accomplished chemist and lexicographer. He served on the Bangiya Sahitya Parishad’s spelling reform committee and produced dictionaries and grammar manuals that influenced textbooks across Bengal.

## Historical Context

The 1930s saw intense discussion about Bengali spelling reform and language modernisation. *Chalantika* synthesised Sanskritist and colloquial perspectives, making it indispensable for writers, editors, and students. Basu’s death in 1960 places the work in the Indian public domain from 1 January 2021; its 1937 publication date means it is public domain in the United States as well.

## Literary & Cultural Significance

- **Standard reference:** Remains a go-to one-volume dictionary for Bengali writers and journalists.
- **Language reform:** Documents the shift from Sanskritised orthography to the chalita style promoted by Rabindranath Tagore and Bhasha Parishad committees.
- **Cultural record:** Contains etymological notes and sample collocations that capture the multilingual texture of early twentieth-century Bengal.
