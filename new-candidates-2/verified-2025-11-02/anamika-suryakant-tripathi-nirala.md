# Anamika

## Overview

Published by Bharati Bhavan (Allahabad) in 1948, *Anamika* represents Nirala’s late-phase poetic innovations. The collection juxtaposes free-verse meditations with lyrics grounded in urban deprivation and labour struggles, signalling his move away from purely symbolist Chhayavād motifs. Signature poems such as “Saroj Smriti”, “Saat Phool”, and “Ram ki Shakti Puja” (included in revised editions) expand Hindi poetic diction to include colloquial speech, ironic repetition, and jagged enjambment.

## About the Author

Suryakant Tripathi ‘Nirala’ (1896–1961) is one of modern Hindi literature’s canonical Chhayavād poets. Orphaned young and largely self-taught, he wrote poetry, essays, short stories, and translations. Nirala’s late work—*Anamika*, *Ardhanarishvar*, *Parimal*—foregrounds social critique, hunger, and widowhood, drawing on his experiences of poverty and the Bengal famine.

## Historical Context

Released one year after Indian independence, the collection registers the turbulence of Partition, inflation, and famine relief. Nirala invokes mythic figures but recontextualises them amid refugee camps and factory tenements. Nirala died in 1961, so *Anamika* entered the Indian public domain on 1 January 2022; Uruguay Round restoration keeps the 1948 edition under U.S. copyright until 2043.

## Literary & Cultural Significance

- **Bridge text:** Marks the transition from romantic Chhayavād to socially conscious Prayogvād/Pragativād in Hindi poetry.
- **Formal innovation:** Deploys free verse, fractured metres, and syntactic breaks that influenced later poets like Raghuvir Sahay and Kunwar Narain.
- **Personal memorial:** Poems mourning Nirala’s daughter Saroj became touchstones for elegiac writing in Hindi.
