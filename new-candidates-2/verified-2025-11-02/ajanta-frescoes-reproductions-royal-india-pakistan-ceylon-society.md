# Ajanta Frescoes: Reproductions in Colour and Monochrome

## Overview

Published in London in 1915, this lavish folio presents high-quality colour plates and monochrome illustrations of the Ajanta cave murals. The reproductions were produced by Lady Christiana Herringham and a team of Indian artists between 1909 and 1911 as part of the Royal India Society’s campaign to document the deteriorating Buddhist murals. Each plate is accompanied by descriptive text detailing the cave location, iconography, pigment analysis, and stylistic comparisons with Gupta sculpture and Central Asian painterly traditions.

## Highlights

- Features scenes from the Jataka tales, royal processions, and Bodhisattva figures (e.g., Padmapani and Vajrapani) rendered with careful attention to colour gradation.
- Includes technical notes on fresco-secco techniques, mineral pigments, and the conservation challenges posed by moisture and smoke damage.
- Provides a historical introduction discussing early surveys by James Fergusson and James Burgess and situating Ajanta within global art history debates.

## Significance

The portfolio offered Western and Indian audiences their first large-scale colour view of Ajanta and influenced modernist painters such as Nandalal Bose and Abanindranath Tagore. It also helped raise awareness for conservation, leading to the Archaeological Survey of India’s protective measures. Researchers still consult these plates to study sections of murals now lost or altered.

## Public Domain Status

Published in 1915, the volume is in the public domain worldwide.
