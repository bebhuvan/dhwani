# Indian Railway Policy

## Overview

Veteran railway engineer Guilford L. Molesworth and legal expert Faredun K. Dadachanji compiled this manual in 1920 to guide legislators, administrators, and investors through the evolving regulatory framework of Indian railways. The volume reproduces key sections of railway acts and rules, summarises Government of India resolutions from Dalhousie to Chelmsford, and analyses contemporary debates on state ownership versus private operation.

## Contents

- **Historical survey (1853–1919):** outlines policy shifts from the guaranteed-company era, through state purchase clauses in the 1860s, to the creation of the Railway Board (1905) and wartime control.
- **Finance and tariffs:** discusses capital structure, freight classification, passenger fares, and the post-war push for rate revision; includes tables comparing working expenditure and net earnings by railway system.
- **Administration:** details the powers of the Railway Board, provincial governments, and company directors; explains tendering, construction contracts, and land acquisition under the Land Acquisition Act.
- **Labour and safety:** summarises workshop regulation, locomotive inspection, accident inquiries, and emerging labour legislation.
- **Future proposals:** reviews the 1918 Committee on Indian Railways and the Acworth Committee’s blueprint for separating railway finance from general revenue.

## Historical Context

Published in the wake of World War I and the Montagu–Chelmsford reforms, the book captures a transitional moment when the colonial state was moving towards fiscal autonomy for railways while grappling with nationalist demands for Indianisation. It served as a reference text for civil servants and members of the Imperial Legislative Council.
