# Excavations at Harappa, Vol. 1

## Overview

This ASI monograph documents the stratigraphy, architecture, and material culture unearthed at Harappa during M. S. Vats’s campaigns.

- Plates and typological tables are vital references for archaeologists studying Harappan ceramics and seal iconography.
- Chronicles early conservation challenges and excavational methodologies in colonial India.

## Public Domain Status
