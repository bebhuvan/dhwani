# A Tamil Hand-Book

## Overview

First printed at Madras in 1859, Pope’s handbook provides English-speaking learners with a thorough introduction to colloquial Tamil. The volume contains phonetic guidance, graded grammar lessons, model letters, commercial documents, and thematic vocabularies (market, court, travel). Dialogues reflect everyday interactions between officials and local residents, helping civil servants and missionaries acquire idiomatic speech.

## Structure

- **Pronunciation and script:** explains Tamil letters, sandhi rules, and transliteration conventions; includes handwriting samples.
- **Grammar:** covers nouns, participles, verb conjugations, honorifics, negative forms, and compounds, illustrated with literal and idiomatic translations.
- **Exercises:** provides translation drills, comprehension passages, and proverbs; includes a section on Tamil poetry metres with examples.
- **Appendices:** commercial phrases, legal terminology, kinship terms, calendar names, and a concise English–Tamil glossary.

## Significance

Pope’s handbook influenced generations of Tamil learners and complemented his later translations of the Tirukkural and Tiruvācakam. It offers insight into mid-nineteenth-century missionary linguistics and remains useful for historical linguists studying colonial Tamil.

## Public Domain Status

Published in 1859, the handbook is in the public domain worldwide.
