# The Stupa of Bharhut

## Overview

Cunningham’s lavishly illustrated monograph records the excavation of the Bharhut stupa in central India, one of the earliest major Buddhist monuments to be scientifically documented. The volume reproduces photographs, lithographic plates, and rubbings of railing pillars, coping stones, and gateways, accompanied by transcriptions and translations of Brahmi inscriptions naming donors, vihāra locations, and scenes from the Buddha’s previous births.

## Contents

- **Historical introduction:** situates Bharhut within the Maurya–Sunga transition, summarises prior antiquarian references and the discovery of the site (1873–74).
- **Architectural analysis:** reconstructs the stupa’s plan, measurements, and construction phases; compares structural elements with Amaravati and Sanchi.
- **Iconography:** catalogues the relief panels—Jataka stories (Chhadanta, Nigrodha), Bodhisattva worship scenes, Yaksha figures, and symbolic worship of the empty throne.
- **Epigraphy:** presents Sanskrit/Prakrit inscriptions with English translations, noting donor identities and geographical references across the Gangetic plains and Deccan.

## Significance

The monograph provided foundational data for Buddhist art history, influencing later scholarship by Fergusson, Coomaraswamy, and modern archaeologists. Many reliefs documented here now reside in museums (Kolkata, Allahabad, Berlin); Cunningham’s plates remain indispensable for researchers studying the stylistic evolution of early Buddhist narrative art.

## Public Domain Status

Published in 1879, the work is in the public domain worldwide.
