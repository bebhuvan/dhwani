# Sahitya-jigyasa (সাহিত্য-জিজ্ঞাসা)

## Overview

Issued in 1958 (Bengali era 1365) by Mitra & Ghosh of Calcutta, *Sahitya-jigyasa* gathers Saralabala Sarkar’s public lectures, radio talks, and commemorative essays on Bengali literature. The preface recalls her early reading in *Dharmamangal* and Rabindranath Tagore’s lyricism, framing the volume as a dialogue between formative childhood encounters and later decades spent teaching within the Ramakrishna Mission women’s network (preface, Archive scan, ff. 3–8). Individual chapters read poets such as Rabindranath, Jibanananda Das, and contemporary dramatists alongside sketches of cultural workers, pointing to the moral imagination that sustained Bengal’s literary renaissance.

## About the Author

Saralabala Sarkar (1880–1961) was a Bengali essayist, translator, and organiser associated with the Ramakrishna Mission’s education and relief initiatives. Banglapedia notes her editorial work for journals and her collaborations with Sarada Devi’s companions. In *Sahitya-jigyasa* she writes as an elder of that circle, blending literary history with personal recollection; her essays preserve anecdotes about Tagore family salons, women’s reading circles, and the Mission’s publishing activity that would otherwise remain in oral memory.

## Historical Context

Published barely a year after India’s second general election, the book addresses readers grappling with the canonisation of Bengali modernism. Sarkar situates canonical authors in lived social settings—describing how a widow’s voice entered poetry, or how nationalist theatre evolved from club performances—thereby tying aesthetic judgement to community experience. Because Sarkar died in 1961, the work has been in the Indian public domain since 1 January 2022 (Copyright Act, 1957, s. 22). Under the United States’ Uruguay Round restoration, however, this 1958 edition remains protected there until 2053.

## Literary & Cultural Significance

- **Women’s critical voice:** The essays document how Bengali women read, taught, and sustained literature, offering a counterpoint to male-dominated criticism of the 1950s.
- **Primary testimony:** Sarkar quotes early printings, speeches, and private letters, giving future scholars firsthand evidence of performance practices and reception histories.
- **Pedagogical orientation:** Many chapters originated as talks for school and ashram audiences, making the book a guide to reading Bengali literature ethically and communally rather than through abstract theory.
