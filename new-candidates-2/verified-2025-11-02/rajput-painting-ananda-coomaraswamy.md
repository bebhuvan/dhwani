# Rajput Painting

## Overview

Coomaraswamy’s classic monograph surveys the development of Rajput painting from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries, emphasising regional schools such as Mewar, Bundi-Kota, Amber-Jaipur, Marwar, Malwa, and the Himalayan (Pahari) centres. Drawing on collections in India and Europe, he analyses iconography from the Rāgamālā, Gītāgovinda, and Bhāgavata Purāṇa series, tracing stylistic lineages and patronage networks.

## Key Themes

- **Aesthetic philosophy:** interprets Rajput painting through Indian aesthetic theory (rasa, bhāva) and the Vaishnava and Śaiva devotional currents that inspired its themes.
- **Technique:** discusses materials (wasli paper, mineral pigments, gold), brushwork, profile conventions, and differentiation between Mughal naturalism and Rajput symbolism.
- **Regional synopses:** provides historical timelines and stylistic features for each school, with tables listing dated sets and key artists (Sahibdin, Nainsukh, Manaku).
- **Plates:** includes 100+ monochrome plates and a colour frontispiece, many documenting works later dispersed across museums.

## Significance

The book established Rajput miniature painting as a serious field of Indian art history, countering colonial dismissals of “folk” art and influencing modern Indian artists. It remains a foundational reference for scholars, collectors, and curators.

## Public Domain Status

Published in 1916, the work is in the public domain worldwide.
