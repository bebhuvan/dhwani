# Medieval Mysticism of India

## Overview

Issued by Macmillan in 1935, *Medieval Mysticism of India* gathers Kshitimohan Sen’s Santiniketan lectures on Bhakti and Sufi saints. Sen organises the study into three parts—North Indian sants (Kabir, Ravidas, Dadu), Bengali Vaishnavism (Chaitanya, Narottam, Sankar Dev), and Indo-Persian Sufis (Nizamuddin Auliya, Guru Nanak, Dara Shukoh). Each chapter combines literary excerpts with historical sketches, illustrating how vernacular mystics challenged ritualism and caste barriers.

## About the Author

Kshitimohan Sen (1880–1960), scholar and professor at Visva-Bharati, specialised in medieval Bhakti poetry. He collected oral verses from sadhus across India and edited anthologies for Rabindranath Tagore’s university. His fieldwork and translations introduced Sant literature to academic audiences.

## Historical Context

Published amid debates on Hindu reform and communal harmony, the book emphasises mystical traditions as shared ethical capital. Sen draws on manuscripts from Santiniketan’s Bichitra Bhavan and conversations with living mendicants, situating Bhakti and Sufi lineages within a broader pan-Indian spirituality. Sen died in 1960, making the book public domain in India from 1 January 2021; its 1935 publication also places it in the U.S. public domain.

## Literary & Cultural Significance

- **Comparative mysticism:** Juxtaposes Hindu Bhakti, Sikh teachings, and Chishti Sufism to highlight shared metaphors of love and service.
- **Primary translations:** Provides English renderings of vernacular songs, many transcribed directly from oral recitation.
- **Visva-Bharati ethos:** Reflects Rabindranath Tagore’s call for cultural synthesis and interfaith dialogue during the late colonial period.
