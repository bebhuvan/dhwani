# The Hymns of the Rigveda

## Overview

Griffith’s translation renders the 1,028 hymns of the Rigveda into accessible English verse, accompanied by brief notes explaining deities, rituals, and key Sanskrit terms. The two volumes follow the traditional division into ten maṇḍalas and provide cross-references to Sayana’s commentary and Ludwig’s German translation. Indices list deities, metres, and key Sanskrit words.

## Significance

Griffith’s work popularised Vedic literature among Anglophone readers and influenced comparative religion studies. Despite later philological revisions, it remains widely cited for its poetic diction and served as a basis for early twentieth-century Hindu reformers and Western seekers.

## Public Domain Status

Published in 1896, the translation is in the public domain worldwide.
