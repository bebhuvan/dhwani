# Rupasi Bangla

## Overview

Written during the 1930s but published posthumously in 1957, *Rupasi Bangla* comprises sixty-two poems where Jibanananda Das renders Bengal’s rivers, forests, and rural life with sensuous imagery and melancholic cadence. The free-verse compositions juxtapose natural beauty with the pain of partition and personal exile.

## Themes

- Evocations of Bengal’s flora and fauna (shiuli, kadam, herons, tigers) interwoven with mythic references (Behula, Madhumita).
- Exploration of memory, longing, and the poet’s complex relationship with his homeland.
- Lyrical experimentation with rhythm and internal rhyme that influenced later Bengali modernism.

## Legacy

The anthology cemented Jibanananda as the “poet of Rupasi Bangla” and inspired musical adaptations, paintings, and contemporary poetry. It remains a staple in Bengali literary canon and diaspora nostalgic culture.

## Public Domain Status

Jibanananda Das died in 1954; *Rupasi Bangla* entered the Indian public domain on 1 January 2025. (The 1957 publication is also in the public domain in the United States.)
