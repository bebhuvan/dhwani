# Jayanti Utsargo (জয়ন্তী-উৎসর্গ)

## Overview

Originally released on 11 Poush 1338 BE (26 December 1931), *Jayanti Utsargo* gathers twenty-one essays, poems, and scholarly tributes offered to Rabindranath Tagore by members of the Rabindra-Parichay Sabha and Visva-Bharati’s publication wing (preface, Archive scan, ff. 3–6). Contributors include Jagadish Chandra Bose, Kamini Roy, Atul Chandra Gupta, Indira Devi Chaudhurani, Prafulla Chandra Ray, and Radhakamal Mukhopadhyay. Their pieces analyse Tagore’s role in Sanskrit learning, music, metrics, language reform, and global cultural exchange, while the opening section documents the Santiniketan community’s preparations for the poet’s birthday.

## About the Contributors

The volume reflects the breadth of Tagore’s circle: scientists such as Jagadish Chandra Bose, economists like Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis, literary critics including Naresh Chandra Sengupta, and artists such as Rajshekhar Basu. Editor Charu Chandra Bhattacharya coordinated the collection on behalf of Visva-Bharati, ensuring that voices from both Santiniketan and Calcutta’s literary world were represented.

## Historical Context

In 1931 Tagore celebrated his seventieth birthday amid debates about his legacy and Santiniketan’s future. The Rabindra-Parichay Sabha formed to study his work systematically, and *Jayanti Utsargo* documents that institutional response. Every contributor in the volume was born before 1900 and died by the early 1960s, placing the anthology in the Indian public domain (life + 60) as of 1 January 2022. Because it was first published in India in 1931, it is also in the public domain in the United States.

## Literary & Cultural Significance

- **Primary reception history:** Offers early critical appreciations of Tagore’s music, drama, educational experiments, and metrics from contemporaries who worked alongside him.
- **Santiniketan archive:** Preserves the voice of the Rabindra-Parichay Sabha and the Visva-Bharati publication programme, providing researchers with institutional memory of Tagore’s 1931 jayanti celebration.
- **Interdisciplinary snapshot:** The mix of scientific, sociological, and literary essays demonstrates how Tagore’s influence crossed disciplinary boundaries in the late colonial period.
