# The Autobiography of Maharshi Devendranath Tagore

## Overview

Macmillan’s 1914 edition translates Devendranath Tagore’s Bengali memoir into English for global readers. Devendranath recounts his youth in Jorasanko, partnership with Raja Rammohun Roy, founding of the Tattwabodhini Sabha, Himalayan retreats, and the gestation of Santiniketan. Appendices provide Brahmo hymns, family trees, and correspondence.

## About the Author and Translator

Devendranath Tagore (1817–1905) shaped the Brahmo Samaj’s second phase, emphasising Upanishadic monism and social reform. His niece Indira Devi Chaudhurani (1873–1960)—a writer, translator, and musician—converted the memoir into lucid English, supplying footnotes to explain Bengali customs, festival calendars, and religious terminology.

## Historical Context

The translation coincided with heightened British interest in Indian religious reform and prefigured Rabindranath Tagore’s Nobel Prize acclaim. It offered Anglophone audiences an insider history of Bengal’s renaissance. Devendranath’s text is long in the public domain; Indira Devi’s translation entered the Indian public domain on 1 January 2021 and has always been public domain in the United States (pre-1923 publication).

## Literary & Cultural Significance

- **Primary document:** Essential for studying Brahmo theology, Tagore family life, and 19th-century reform networks.
- **Translation milestone:** Models early twentieth-century strategies for rendering Bengali religious vocabulary into English.
- **Inspirational text:** Informed Santiniketan’s ethos and influenced subsequent autobiographical writing within the Tagore circle.
