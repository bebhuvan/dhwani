# Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum, Volume I: Inscriptions of Asoka

## Overview

This Archaeological Survey of India volume, edited by epigrapher Eugen Hultzsch, compiles all known edicts of Ashoka. Each inscription is presented with photographs, estampages, transliterations in Roman script, Sanskrit/Prakrit reconstructions, and English translations. Detailed notes address palaeography, dialectal variations, historical context, and cross-references to Greek and Aramaic versions.

## Significance

- Provides palaeographic plates crucial for deciphering regional Brahmi scripts and dating subsequent inscriptions.
- Informs scholarship on Buddhist history, political ideology, and the Mauryan empire’s communication strategies.

## Public Domain Status
