# India for Indians

## Overview

Issued by Prabasi Press in 1918 with a foreword by Motilal Ghose, *India for Indians* collects the campaign speeches that propelled C. R. Das from Calcutta barrister to national leader. Delivered in Calcutta, Mymensingh, Dacca, Barisal, and other Bengal centres, the addresses outline a road map for majority rule: repeal of repressive wartime ordinances, provincial autonomy anchored in elected assemblies, and a mass awakening that binds Hindu and Muslim constituencies into a single anti-colonial platform.

## Structure and Themes

Each chapter reproduces a specific public meeting—protests against internments, home-rule rallies, deputations to London—preserving Das’s cadence and rhetorical flourishes. He links the Bengal literary renaissance to political mobilisation, invokes Tilak and Naoroji as mentors, and argues that swadeshi industries and national schools must grow alongside constitutional agitation. The inclusion of audience responses and local resolutions turns the book into a documentary record of Bengal’s grassroots politics during the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms.

## Historical Significance

The collection illuminates how Das built the “Deshbandhu” persona before the Non-Cooperation movement: he advocates disciplined non-violence yet refuses token councils, insisting that only an Indian-controlled executive can alleviate famine, debt, and communal suspicion. The speeches seeded organisational models for the Bengal Provincial Congress and later influenced the Swaraj Party that Das co-founded in 1923.

## Public Domain Status

Chitta Ranjan Das died in 1925; under India’s life-plus-sixty term the work entered the public domain on 1 January 1986. Published in 1918, it is also in the public domain in the United States, so the linked Project Gutenberg text and Internet Archive facsimile may be reused freely.

## Research Directions

- Collate these speeches with reports in *The Bengalee* and *Amrita Bazar Patrika* to compare contemporary press framing of Das’s rhetoric.
- Analyse how Das frames provincial finance and education when responding to Muslim leaders in Mymensingh and Dacca.
- Use the transcripts to track the evolution of the Swaraj Party platform from local petitions to national legislative strategy.
