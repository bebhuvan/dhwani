# Karma-Yoga

## Overview

Based on lectures delivered in New York in 1895–1896, Vivekananda’s *Karma-Yoga* articulates how the Bhagavad Gita’s ideal of selfless work can guide modern professionals. The text reframes Hindu notions of duty (*dharma*) for an industrialising world, insisting that spiritual realisation is compatible with active civic service.

## Structure and Themes

Eight chapters examine the psychology of work, the relationship between freedom and responsibility, and the practice of detachment. Vivekananda critiques fatalism, arguing that disciplined action purified of selfish desire leads to liberation. Case studies—from nurses in hospitals to craftsmen at their benches—illustrate how ordinary labour becomes a path to self-knowledge when performed without attachment to results.

## Historical and Cultural Significance

Published by the Vedanta Society of New York in 1896, *Karma-Yoga* offered Western audiences a systematic introduction to Vedantic ethics. The lectures influenced reformers in India—particularly the Ramakrishna Mission’s philanthropic programmes—and resonated with Progressive Era social workers in the United States. Mahatma Gandhi later cited the book while elaborating his own doctrine of *seva* (service).

## Public Domain Status

Vivekananda died in 1902, placing his writings in the Indian public domain on 1 January 1963. The 1896 publication date also makes the text public domain in the United States. The Internet Archive hosts reliable scans of the first edition.

## Research Directions

- Compare the New York lectures with Vivekananda’s later Calcutta addresses to trace how he adapted *karma-yoga* for Indian political contexts.
- Analyse the book’s reception in American newspapers and magazines to map early Vedanta networks in the West.
- Investigate how Ramakrishna Mission manuals operationalised Vivekananda’s ethic of service in schools and relief efforts.
- Situate the text alongside contemporaneous Protestant social-gospel writings to explore cross-cultural convergences on labour ethics.
