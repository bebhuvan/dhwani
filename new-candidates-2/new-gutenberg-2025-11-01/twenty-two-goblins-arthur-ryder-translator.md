# Twenty-Two Goblins

## Overview

This translation of the medieval Sanskrit cycle *Vetālapañcaviṃśati* recounts how King Vikramāditya attempts to capture a corpse inhabited by a goblin who narrates riddling stories. After each tale the king must answer a moral puzzle or forfeit his life, fusing adventure with didacticism.

## Structure and Themes

Ryder presents twenty-two stories framed by the king’s repeated journeys through a cremation ground. Each tale tests judgement on loyalty, justice, and gender roles. The goblin’s puzzles force Vikrama to weigh conflicting duties—between friends and family, truth and compassion—highlighting the ethical complexity of royal decision-making.

## Historical and Cultural Significance

The Vetāla stories have circulated in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and vernacular versions for centuries. Ryder’s early twentieth-century translation introduced the cycle to Western audiences and inspired children’s adaptations and theatrical retellings. The work reveals narrative techniques that later informed detective fiction and popular Indian television series.

## Public Domain Status

Arthur W. Ryder died in 1938, placing his translation in the Indian public domain as of 1999. The 1917 publication is also public domain in the United States. Digital copies from Project Gutenberg and the Internet Archive are freely accessible.

## Research Directions

- Compare Ryder’s translation with original Sanskrit and Hindi retellings to evaluate shifts in tone and structure.
- Analyse the riddles’ ethical frameworks alongside ancient *Dharmaśāstra* literature on kingship.
- Investigate modern adaptations—from Satyajit Ray’s *Goopy Bagha* films to Doordarshan serials—to trace the cycle’s cultural persistence.
- Explore the framing narrative’s depiction of cremation grounds and tantric practices within the broader *Kathāsaritsāgara* tradition.
