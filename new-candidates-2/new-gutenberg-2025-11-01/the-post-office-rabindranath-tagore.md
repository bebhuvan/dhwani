# The Post Office

## Overview

Originally premiered in Bengali in 1912 and self-translated into English two years later, *The Post Office* follows the fevered child Amal as he watches imperial officials erect a post office outside his window. Confined to his adoptive uncle’s house, Amal imagines the postal system as a conduit to the wider world and to King’s messengers who may liberate him from quarantine. Tagore’s spare dialogue and lyrical interludes turn a small domestic setting into a meditation on the circulation of messages, the limits of medical authority, and the human appetite for transcendence.

## Structure and Themes

The one-act drama unfolds through a sequence of visitors—a wandering minstrel, a village boy, a humble watchman, a critical schoolmaster—who each articulate competing modes of knowledge. Amal’s questions reveal Tagore’s critique of rote education and colonial bureaucracy; the Headman and the Physician insist on regulation, while the Postmaster and the royal Herald eventually respond with compassion. The absence of onstage spectacle intensifies the play’s auditory motifs: conch shells, drums, the imagined hum of letters, and the drumbeat announcing the King’s arrival. The work interrogates themes of freedom, mortality, and the imagination’s capacity to resist administrative confinement.

## Historical and Cultural Significance

*The Post Office* circulated widely during the First World War, inspiring W. B. Yeats to stage it for the Irish National Theatre and later being performed in Polish ghettos during the Holocaust as a testament to spiritual resilience. In colonial Bengal, the play extended Tagore’s Swadeshi-era critique of coercive governance while also speaking to global debates about quarantine, surveillance, and the “sick” body politic. Its child protagonist enabled Tagore to fuse the sentimental language of humanitarianism with anticolonial aspirations, helping the drama become one of the first South Asian plays to enter the European repertory.

## Public Domain Status

Rabindranath Tagore died in 1941, placing his works in India’s public domain on 1 January 2002. The English translation was published in 1914, well before the United States’ 1923 cut-off, so it is also public domain in the U.S. The linked Project Gutenberg text and Internet Archive scan offer freely accessible copies for study and performance.

## Research Directions

- Compare the English translation against the 1912 Bengali original to trace Tagore’s tonal adjustments for international audiences.
- Study staging choices in early Yeats productions and later Holocaust-era performances to understand how the play’s allegory adapted to diverse political emergencies.
- Analyse the play alongside contemporary quarantine regulations in British India to explore how public-health discourse shaped Tagore’s dramaturgy.
- Investigate Tagore’s use of sound and silence by mapping references to postal technologies, music, and birdsong across the script.
