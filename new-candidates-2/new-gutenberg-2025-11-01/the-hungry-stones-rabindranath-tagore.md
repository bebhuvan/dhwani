# The Hungry Stones, and Other Stories

## Overview

The 1916 volume *The Hungry Stones, and Other Stories* assembles English translations of Tagore’s celebrated Bengali tales, including “The Hungry Stones,” “The Victory,” “Once There Was a King,” and “The Devotee.” Set amid Mughal palaces, rural courts, and riverside ferries, these stories blend allegory with psychological interiority, dramatising greed, devotion, and the lingering violence of empire. The title story follows an excise officer who grows obsessed with the spectral memories embedded in a marble palace—an emblem of how colonial administrators become captive to the past they exploit.

## Translation and Publication Context

Macmillan released the British edition in 1916 after Tagore’s Nobel Prize heightened global demand for his fiction. The translations emerged through the poet’s circle: Tagore revised drafts by his nephew Surendranath Tagore, sister-in-law Pratibha Devi, and other collaborators to retain Bengali cadences while meeting anglophone expectations. Comparing the English versions with original Bengali publications in *Sabuj Patra* reveals shifts in narrative perspective and condensation of dialogue to suit the short-story norms of Edwardian magazines.

## Themes and Influence

- **Haunting colonial spaces:** Ruined palaces and forests personify collective memory, critiquing the extractive logic of British bureaucracy.
- **Women’s agency:** Stories like “The Victory” spotlight female intellectual labour, echoing Tagore’s advocacy for women’s education.
- **Everyday mysticism:** Tagore juxtaposes devotional songs, folk rituals, and rationalist characters to interrogate the search for transcendence within domestic life.

The book travelled quickly—American editions appeared via Macmillan (New York) and the India Society—introducing Western readers to modern Bengali prose before translations of Sarat Chandra or Premchand gained traction.

## Public Domain Status

Tagore died in 1941, placing the collection in the Indian public domain on 1 January 2002. Published in 1916, it is likewise in the U.S. public domain, enabling the open-access Project Gutenberg text and Internet Archive facsimiles cited above.

## Research Suggestions

- Collate the English translations with the Bengali originals (*Kshudhita Pashan o Anyanya Galpo*) to analyse narrative omissions and tonal shifts.
- Examine period reviews in *The Times Literary Supplement* and *Modern Review* for reception history and orientalist framing.
- Use the collection in comparative studies of colonial Gothic alongside Kipling’s “The Phantom Rickshaw” or Satyajit Ray’s later adaptations.
