# The Problem of the Rupee: Its Origin and Its Solution

## Overview

Doctor B. R. Ambedkar submitted this study to the London School of Economics in 1923 after analysing half a century of currency chaos triggered by the global decline of silver prices. Working with statistical series from the Indian Finance Department and contemporary bullion markets, Ambedkar explains how the rupee’s fluctuating purchasing power undermined agrarian credit, pegged colonial taxation to unstable metal ratios, and fuelled recurrent exchange crises. The treatise situates monetary policy within the political economy of empire, arguing that British insistence on a silver standard transferred volatility to Indian peasants while shielding metropolitan investors.

## Structure and Arguments

The book unfolds across eleven chapters and an appendix of exchange tables. Ambedkar first narrates the rupee’s medieval evolution, then quantifies nineteenth-century depreciation using commodity price indices and rupee–sterling exchange rates. Turning to policy proposals, he critiques the Fowler Committee’s half-hearted gold standard and rejects currency boards that deny India autonomous control over reserves. Instead, he recommends a gold-exchange standard backed by a currency authority empowered to regulate note issuance, manage sterling balances, and defend a fixed gold parity—anticipating institutions later embedded in the Reserve Bank of India Act (1934).

## Impact and Reception

Ambedkar’s meticulous data gathering made the book a touchstone for Indian nationalists debating fiscal self-rule. The Hilton Young Commission cited his work during deliberations that created the Reserve Bank, while post-independence economists revisited his critique when India confronted balance-of-payments pressures in the 1950s. Beyond policy circles, Dalit movements highlighted the study to showcase Ambedkar’s economic acumen alongside his constitutional and social-justice writings, making the text a staple in Indian monetary history curricula.

## Public Domain Status

Ambedkar died in 1956; under India’s life-plus-sixty term, the work entered the Indian public domain on 1 January 2017. The 1923 publication date keeps it within the United States’ public domain as well, enabling open distribution via Project Gutenberg and the Internet Archive scans listed above.

## Research Pointers

- Compare Ambedkar’s exchange-rate tables with the 1927 Hilton Young Report to trace how his calculations informed subsequent policy.
- Pair the text with contemporary pamphlets by J. M. Keynes and Dadabhai Naoroji to examine competing colonial revenue models.
- Use the appendices’ wheat, cotton, and rupee price data to reconstruct long-run inflation trends with modern econometric tools.
