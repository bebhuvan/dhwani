# Songs of Kabir

## Overview

Translated by Tagore with a preface by Evelyn Underhill, *Songs of Kabir* presents one hundred hymns attributed to the fifteenth-century weaver-saint. The poems denounce ritualism and celebrate a formless divine present in both Hindu and Muslim traditions.

## Structure and Themes

Tagore arranges the songs thematically—on love, knowledge, guru devotion, and the soul’s union with the divine. The imagery of weaving, rivers, and inner music reflects Kabir’s artisan background. The poems advocate direct experience of God (*sahaj samādhi*) and critique caste and sectarian boundaries.

## Historical and Cultural Significance

The 1915 volume joined the Nobel laureate Tagore with the Bhakti poet Kabir, amplifying India’s devotional pluralism for Western readers during wartime. It influenced figures such as Thomas Merton and the Trappist contemplative movement, while in India the translation supported efforts by the Sant Mat and Sikh communities to disseminate Kabir’s message.

## Public Domain Status

Kabir’s medieval verses are long in the public domain. Tagore’s translation, published in 1915, entered the public domain in India in 2002 and is also public domain in the United States. Digital editions are freely accessible.

## Research Directions

- Compare Tagore’s renderings with earlier translations by Charlotte Vaudeville or later ones by Linda Hess to assess interpretive choices.
- Examine how the selection aligns with the *Adi Granth* and the Kabir Panth repertoire, noting omissions or rearrangements.
- Study the role of Evelyn Underhill’s preface in framing Kabir within Western mysticism discourse.
- Explore musical adaptations of Tagore’s English versions in global hymnody and fusion performances.
