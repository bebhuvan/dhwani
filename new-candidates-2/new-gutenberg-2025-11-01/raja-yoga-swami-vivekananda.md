# Raja-Yoga

## Overview

Derived from lectures given in New York and London, *Raja-Yoga* systematises Vivekananda’s understanding of classical yoga. He interprets Patanjali’s eight limbs through a modern scientific idiom, presenting yoga as a practical psychology of concentration complemented by ethical preparation.

## Structure and Themes

The book opens with lectures on the mind-body relationship before translating key sections of the *Yoga-Sutras*. Vivekananda emphasises the role of breath control, posture, and focused will in disciplining thought. He argues that Raja Yoga, when combined with Karma and Bhakti, forms a complete path to liberation suitable for householders and monks alike.

## Historical and Cultural Significance

Published in 1896, the text introduced Western readers to Patanjali’s system decades before yoga’s popularisation as physical culture. It shaped the curriculum of Vedanta societies, influenced comparative religion scholars like William James, and inspired Indian reformers to reclaim yogic traditions as rational and scientific.

## Public Domain Status

With Vivekananda’s death in 1902 and the work’s nineteenth-century publication, *Raja-Yoga* is public domain worldwide. The Internet Archive edition reproduces the first Vedanta Society printing with Vivekananda’s own notes.

## Research Directions

- Compare Vivekananda’s translation choices with Max Müller’s and later critical editions to analyse interpretive shifts.
- Map how early yoga teachers in India and abroad cited *Raja-Yoga* in manuals and lecture tours.
- Study the interplay between Raja Yoga and contemporary psychological theories, especially William James’s *Varieties of Religious Experience*.
- Investigate how Vivekananda’s framing of yoga as “science” influenced nationalist discourses on physical culture.
