# Freedom Through Disobedience

## Overview

Compiled during the Non-Cooperation Movement, this volume gathers speeches delivered by Deshbandhu Chitta Ranjan Das between 1919 and 1921. Speaking across Bengal and the United Provinces, Das elaborates a moral and constitutional case for nonviolent resistance to British rule.

## Structure and Themes

The speeches address specific campaigns—boycotts of foreign cloth, renunciation of titles, defence of political prisoners—and articulate the discipline required for civil disobedience. Das emphasises unity between Hindus and Muslims, critiques repressive legislation, and insists that freedom cannot be granted from above but must be claimed through persistent, self-sacrificing action.

## Historical and Cultural Significance

Das was a pivotal strategist of the Non-Cooperation Movement and later founder of the Swaraj Party. These speeches document his influence on Bengal politics and his disagreements with both extremist and moderate factions. The volume illuminates how legal expertise and oratory merged to inspire mass mobilisation before Gandhi’s suspension of the movement in 1922.

## Public Domain Status

Das died in 1925; his works entered the Indian public domain on 1 January 1986. Published in 1922, the book is also public domain in the United States. Digital transcriptions and scans are freely available.

## Research Directions

- Compare the speeches with contemporaneous writings by Gandhi, Motilal Nehru, and Subhas Bose to map ideological divergences within the nationalist movement.
- Analyse press coverage of Das’s rallies to understand audience reception and British surveillance responses.
- Study how the speeches shaped the organisational framework of the Swaraj Party and municipal politics in Calcutta.
- Examine references to global resistance movements to situate Das’s rhetoric within international debates on civil disobedience.
