# Lectures from Colombo to Almora

## Overview

Compiled from stenographic notes, these addresses document Vivekananda’s 1897 journey from Colombo (Sri Lanka) to Almora in the Himalayas. Speaking to thronging crowds, he synthesised Vedanta, national pride, and practical schemes for education and relief work.

## Structure and Themes

Forty-two lectures cover topics such as the ideal of service, women's education, caste reform, and the scientific spirit in Hinduism. Vivekananda urges Indians to combine spiritual heritage with modern industry, repeatedly quoting the Upanishads to inspire confidence. The text concludes with his Almora discourses on Shiva worship and Advaita insights.

## Historical and Cultural Significance

The tour marked Vivekananda’s homecoming after the 1893 Parliament of Religions and catalysed the formation of the Ramakrishna Mission. His speeches energised nationalist youth, influenced leaders like Sister Nivedita and Aurobindo, and provided a blueprint for faith-based social service in colonial India.

## Public Domain Status

Published in 1897, the collection is in the public domain worldwide. The Internet Archive offers scans of the first Indian edition authorised by Vivekananda’s disciples.

## Research Directions

- Compare regional audiences’ responses by analysing contemporary newspaper reports from Colombo, Madras, Calcutta, and Almora.
- Examine how the lectures informed the Ramakrishna Mission’s early projects in famine relief and education.
- Study Vivekananda’s rhetoric of national regeneration alongside contemporary speeches by Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Gopalkrishna Gokhale.
- Investigate how later editions edited or rearranged the lectures to align with changing organisational priorities.
