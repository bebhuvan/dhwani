# Rajmohan's Wife

## Overview

Serialised in 1864 in the *Indian Field*, Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay’s *Rajmohan's Wife* is widely regarded as the first Indian novel composed in English. It follows Matangini, a young woman trapped in an abusive marriage, who becomes embroiled in a conspiracy to steal her brother-in-law’s estate papers.

## Structure and Themes

Blending domestic melodrama with detective fiction, the novel explores female agency, the ethics of loyalty, and the corruptions of zamindari politics. Matangini’s moral courage contrasts with the fecklessness of male characters, while the plot’s legal intrigue critiques colonial revenue structures and patriarchal control over property.

## Historical and Cultural Significance

Bankim wrote the novel before turning primarily to Bengali prose; its experiment with English reveals early negotiations of colonial language by Indian authors. *Rajmohan's Wife* prefigures the themes of Bankim’s later nationalist novels and offers invaluable insight into mid-nineteenth-century social reform debates concerning women’s rights and domestic violence.

## Public Domain Status

Bankim died in 1894, placing his works in India’s public domain long before the present. Despite limited contemporary circulation, the preserved scans allow renewed scholarship on India’s first Anglophone novel.

## Research Directions

- Compare the English text with Bankim’s later Bengali novels to examine how language choice affected narrative voice and social critique.
- Analyse Matangini’s character alongside reformist writings on widow remarriage and women’s education of the 1860s.
- Study the novel’s serialization context to understand missionary readerships and the role of the *Indian Field* magazine.
- Explore adaptations or translations that reintroduce the novel to present-day Bengali and English audiences.
