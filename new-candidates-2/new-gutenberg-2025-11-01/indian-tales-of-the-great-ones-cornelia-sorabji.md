# Indian Tales of the Great Ones Among Men, Women, and Bird-People

## Overview

Issued in 1916 by Blackie & Son, Cornelia Sorabji’s collection adapts pan-Indian legends for English-speaking children. The volume moves from Vedic and Purāṇic narratives (Prahlad, Savitri, Harishchandra) to Buddhist jatakas and Zoroastrian lore, weaving explanatory glosses that demystify Sanskrit terms while highlighting ethical dilemmas. Sorabji’s framing voice—a woman advocate addressing young readers—invites comparisons with contemporaneous imperial nursery literature that often sidelined indigenous perspectives.

## Authorship and Audience

Sorabji, the first woman to earn a law degree in India, wrote the stories while campaigning for the legal rights of purdah-observing women (zenanas). Her preface explains that these retellings emerged from conversations with girls in mission schools and princely courts who lacked access to vernacular source texts. She retains regional details—festival settings, caste markers, craft techniques—yet modulates violence and ritual complexity to align with Edwardian child-rearing ideals. The inclusion of full-page colour plates by Warwick Goble situates the book within the gift-book market that circulated between Bombay and London during the First World War.

## Themes and Pedagogy

- **Women-centred heroism:** Stories like “The Queen Who Solved the Riddle” and “The Mother of the Bird People” foreground women’s intellectual agency, echoing Sorabji’s legal advocacy for widows and property rights.
- **Interreligious pluralism:** By juxtaposing Hindu, Buddhist, and Zoroastrian tales, Sorabji constructs a cosmopolitan ethical canon, framing India as a shared civilisational space rather than a sectarian patchwork.
- **Moral pedagogy through wonder:** Each narrative pairs marvellous events with practical lessons (truthfulness, hospitality, filial duty), offering teachers ready-made discussion prompts for colonial and nationalist classrooms alike.

## Public Domain Notes

Cornelia Sorabji died in 1954, placing the book in the Indian public domain on 1 January 2015. The linked Internet Archive scan preserves Warwick Goble’s illustrations, while Project Gutenberg’s text transcription facilitates keyword searches across the narrative corpus for motif indexing.

## Research Questions

- Compare Sorabji’s adaptations with their Sanskrit or Prakrit sources to trace how she simplifies metre, compresses episodic structure, or adds feminist commentary.
- Study the visual program alongside Goble’s earlier fairy-tale illustrations to analyse orientalist colour palettes and their reception in Indian periodicals.
- Situate the collection within Sorabji’s broader reform writing—especially *Between the Twilights* (1908)—to examine how children’s literature supported her legal activism.
