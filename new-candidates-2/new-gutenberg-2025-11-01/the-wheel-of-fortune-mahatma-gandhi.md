# The Wheel of Fortune

## Overview

First published by Ganesh & Co. in 1922, *The Wheel of Fortune* anthologises Gandhi’s essays on swadeshi, spinning, and economic self-reliance originally printed in *Young India*. Beginning with the manifesto “Dawn of a New Era,” Gandhi argues that the charkha is simultaneously a moral discipline and an industrial policy capable of dismantling the dependency created by Lancashire textiles.

## Structure and Themes

The book is organised into topical sections—“Swadeshi,” “The Wheel of Fortune,” and “Swaraj”—each compiling multiple editorials and public addresses. Gandhi details the first-stage non-cooperation programme, debates Kasturi Ranga Iyengar on boycott strategy, and offers practical advice for organising spinning depots, cooperative credit, and village education. Economic analysis sits alongside spiritual reflection: he contrasts Western industrial modernity with a future “civilisation of simplicity” anchored in village crafts.

## Historical Significance

Issued during the high tide of non-cooperation, the volume became a handbook for Congress volunteers and khadi workers. Gandhi’s insistence on hand-spinning as both livelihood and liturgy inspired nationwide charkha drives, the All-India Spinners’ Association (1925), and later constructive-programme initiatives. The essays also chronicle his dialogue with critics who feared economic regression, revealing how Gandhian economics attempted to reconcile self-rule with social justice.

## Public Domain Status

Gandhi died in 1948, placing the collection in the Indian public domain on 1 January 2009. Because the text was issued before 1923, it is also public domain in the United States, and both Project Gutenberg and the Internet Archive provide unrestricted access to the scans and transcriptions listed above.

## Research Directions

- Compare these essays with contemporaneous *Young India* issues to trace editorial revisions between newspaper and book form.
- Quantify Gandhi’s village-industry proposals using data from the Montagu Industrial Commission to evaluate their economic feasibility.
- Situate Gandhi’s critique of “machine civilisation” against debates with Jawaharlal Nehru and Rabindranath Tagore on technology and nationalism.
