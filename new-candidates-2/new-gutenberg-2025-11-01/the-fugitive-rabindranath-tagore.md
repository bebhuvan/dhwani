# The Fugitive

## Overview

Composed after Tagore’s Japan and United States tours during which he confronted rising nationalism and racial violence, *The Fugitive* (1921) collects prose-poems that voice the anxieties of a global pilgrim. The narrator wanders through bombed landscapes, refugee camps, and imagined sanctuaries, searching for moral ground amid the political upheavals of the early twentieth century.

## Structure and Themes

The eighty-four numbered pieces oscillate between narrative fragments and meditations. Tagore juxtaposes the fugitive’s restlessness with recurring images of water, boats, and thresholds. Major themes include hospitality, the ethics of exile, the critique of technological warfare, and the tension between cosmopolitan ideals and national borders. The work’s free-form structure allows Tagore to shift registers—from prophetic indignation to intimate confession—within a single page.

## Historical and Cultural Significance

*The Fugitive* marks a pivot in Tagore’s international reputation: once celebrated as a spiritual sage, he here voices sharp criticisms of imperial Japan, the industrial West, and narrow nationalism. Indian readers recognised the collection as an ethical response to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and the 1919–1921 Non-Cooperation Movement, even though Tagore remained sceptical of mass politics. The book influenced later diasporic writers grappling with displacement, including Sri Lankan poet Anne Ranasinghe and Bangladeshi author Syed Waliullah.

## Public Domain Status

Published in 1921 and authored by Tagore (d. 1941), the collection is in the public domain in India and the United States. The linked editions provide accessible copies for textual comparison and performance.

## Research Directions

- Compare the prose-poems with Tagore’s contemporaneous letters to trace direct responses to events such as the Washington Naval Conference or the Japanese annexation of Korea.
- Analyse the fugitive figure alongside Tagore’s essays *Crisis in Civilization* and *Nationalism* to explore his evolving political philosophy.
- Investigate translations into Bengali and other Indian languages to see how Tagore reabsorbed the English originals into domestic debates.
- Consider staging or multimedia adaptations that use *The Fugitive* to examine modern refugee crises and climate migration.
