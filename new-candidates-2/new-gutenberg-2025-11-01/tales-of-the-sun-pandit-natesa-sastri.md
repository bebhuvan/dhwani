# Tales of the Sun; or, Folklore of Southern India

## Overview

Published in 1890, this collection assembles thirty folk stories that Natesa Sastri learned from women storytellers and temple reciters across the Madras Presidency. The tales feature wily queens, talking animals, and trickster deities, offering insight into domestic entertainment and moral instruction in South Indian households.

## Structure and Themes

Organised into thematic groups, the stories draw on Tamil and Telugu oral repertoires but are adapted into idiomatic English. Sastri preserves performative elements—repetitive refrains, playful asides, and proverbial wisdom—while providing footnotes on caste customs and ritual contexts. Themes include clever brides, just rulers, and the triumph of wit over brute force.

## Historical and Cultural Significance

Natesa Sastri was among the earliest Indian folklorists to publish regional tales in English, challenging colonial anthropologists who doubted the sophistication of Indian oral literature. The volume influenced subsequent compilations by A. K. Ramanujan and enriched comparative folklore studies by documenting narratives from women’s storytelling circles rarely recorded elsewhere.

## Public Domain Status

Sastri died in 1906; his works entered India’s public domain well before the present. The 1890 edition is also public domain in the United States, with accessible digital facsimiles available.

## Research Directions

- Compare Sastri’s translations with later Tamil retellings to analyse shifts in tone and moral emphasis.
- Examine the role of women storytellers in preserving folklore by cross-referencing the narrator profiles Sastri mentions.
- Map motifs using the Aarne–Thompson–Uther index to position South Indian tales within global folklore typologies.
- Explore illustrations and marginal notes to understand colonial-era expectations about “native” storytelling.
