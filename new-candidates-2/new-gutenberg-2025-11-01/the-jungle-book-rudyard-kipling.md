# The Jungle Book

## Overview

Published in 1894, *The Jungle Book* gathers seven stories Kipling drafted while living in Vermont and draws on the wildlife of central India’s Seoni forests. The Mowgli trilogy (“Mowgli’s Brothers,” “Kaa’s Hunting,” “Tiger! Tiger!”) anchors the collection, framing a feral child’s initiation into the “Law of the Jungle,” while companion tales such as “Rikki-Tikki-Tavi,” “Toomai of the Elephants,” and “The White Seal” juxtapose animal agency with imperial anxieties about discipline, loyalty, and belonging. The prose alternates between lush ethnographic description and clipped military cadence, underscoring the book’s dual identity as animal fable and colonial adventure narrative.

## Publication and Textual History

Most stories first appeared in 1893–94 periodicals (*St. Nicholas Magazine*, *The Pall Mall Gazette*, *The Cosmopolitan*) before Macmillan issued the illustrated London edition in 1894. W. H. Drake and Kipling’s father, John Lockwood Kipling, supplied engravings that shaped readers’ imagination of the Indian jungle. Kipling’s 1895 follow-up, *The Second Jungle Book*, reorganised the Mowgli cycle and added poems that many later collected editions reprint contiguously. Tracking which magazine versions were revised for book publication is essential for scholars comparing diction, vernacular dialogue, and the ordering of the “Law of the Jungle” maxims.

## Themes and Reception

Kipling uses the jungle polity to reflect on colonial governance: the “law” codifies mutual obligation, while Shere Khan and the Bandar-log embody rule-breaking threats that British administrators associated with rebellion. Critics have long debated the work’s imperial paternalism; recent ecocritical readings foreground its catalogues of flora and fauna and the way the stories mediate between premodern oral lore and late-Victorian scientific natural history. The book’s framing poems (“Hunting-Song of the Seeonee Pack,” “Road-Song of the Bandar-Log”) contributed to its musical and theatrical afterlives, from Percy Grainger’s settings to Disney’s 1967 adaptation. Early Indian nationalists nevertheless appreciated Kipling’s acknowledgement of subcontinental landscapes, even as they rejected his politics, illustrating the text’s complex circulation within anglophone India.

## Public Domain Status

Rudyard Kipling died in 1936, placing *The Jungle Book* in the Indian public domain on 1 January 1997 under the life-plus-sixty regime. Because the 1894 edition predates the United States’ 1923 cut-off, it is also public domain in the U.S., which enables cross-hosting on Project Gutenberg and the Internet Archive. The Archive scan linked above derives from a Macmillan first edition and preserves the Drake and J. L. Kipling illustrations for bibliographic comparison.

## Research and Teaching Pointers

- Collate the Macmillan 1894 table of contents with the earlier magazine order to track narrative sequencing.
- Analyse the “Law of the Jungle” verses alongside British colonial legal manuals to explore analogies between animal and human jurisprudence.
- Compare the chapter “Rikki-Tikki-Tavi” with contemporaneous Anglo-Indian household management guides to contextualise the bungalow setting and domestic labour structures.
- Pair the text with responses by Indian writers (e.g., Dhan Gopal Mukerji’s *Kari the Elephant*, 1922) to stage a classroom debate about animal allegory and empire.
