# The Hindoos as They Are

## Overview

Published in 1881, Shib Chunder Bose’s study examines domestic rituals, social customs, and religious practices in Bengali Hindu society. As a Brahmo reformer, Bose aimed to expose social conventions to English readers while encouraging introspection among compatriots.

## Structure and Themes

Chapters address family hierarchy, marriage ceremonies, widows, caste, festivals, and women’s education. Bose combines participant observation with critique, describing both the warmth of joint-family life and the injustices of child marriage, dowry, and purdah. His narrative oscillates between affection for cultural traditions and calls for ethical reform grounded in Hindu scripture.

## Historical and Cultural Significance

The book provides a rare indigenous ethnography contemporaneous with colonial administrative reports. It influenced social reform debates within the Brahmo Samaj and offered British officials an alternative to orientalist caricatures. Modern historians use the text to reconstruct everyday life in Bengal’s urban middle class during the lead-up to the national movement.

## Public Domain Status

With an 1881 publication date and an author who died in 1897, the work is public domain globally. The sources listed provide open-access editions for citational use.

## Research Directions

- Compare Bose’s observations with those of British ethnographers like William Hunter to assess divergent portrayals of Bengali society.
- Examine how the book was received within reformist and orthodox circles through periodical reviews.
- Analyse Bose’s gendered narratives to understand evolving attitudes toward women’s education and agency.
- Use the text as a lens to study the intersection of religion, caste, and modernity in Bengal’s bhadralok class.
