# The Home and the World

## Overview

Set in 1907 at the height of the Swadeshi boycott movement, *The Home and the World* unfolds through three alternating narrators: the liberal landowner Nikhil, his sheltered wife Bimala, and the charismatic nationalist agitator Sandip. The novel examines how anti-colonial fervour transforms domestic relationships and challenges notions of duty, desire, and ethical leadership.

## Structure and Themes

Tagore structures the narrative as a series of diary entries, allowing readers to inhabit conflicting perspectives. Themes include the seductions and dangers of political charisma, the gendered boundaries between zenana and public sphere, and the moral cost of violence in nationalist struggle. Bimala’s awakening complicates binaries between tradition and modernity, while Nikhil’s principled nonviolence contrasts with Sandip’s instrumentalism.

## Historical and Cultural Significance

Written soon after Tagore’s own involvement in the Swadeshi movement, the novel critiques extremist tactics without endorsing colonial rule. It sparked controversy among contemporaries who viewed Sandip as a thinly veiled caricature of nationalist leaders. The book influenced Satyajit Ray’s 1984 film *Ghare-Baire* and remains pivotal for feminist readings of Indian nationalism, offering one of the earliest nuanced portrayals of a woman negotiating political agency.

## Public Domain Status

Published in 1916 and authored by Tagore (d. 1941), the text is in the public domain in India and the United States. The Gutenberg transcription and Archive scan provide reliable study editions.

## Research Directions

- Analyse Bimala’s narrative arc alongside early twentieth-century debates on women’s education and the zenana reform movement.
- Compare Nikhil’s political philosophy with Tagore’s essays "Constructive Swadeshi" and "Nationalism in India."
- Investigate reception in Bengali periodicals to understand how nationalist readers negotiated the novel’s critique of militant tactics.
- Explore adaptations—film, theatre, and radio—that reinterpret the triangle to reflect later political crises.
