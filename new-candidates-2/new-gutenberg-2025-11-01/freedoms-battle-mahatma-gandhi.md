# Freedom's Battle

## Overview

Published in 1922 by Navajivan, *Freedom’s Battle* gathers Gandhi’s journalism from *Young India* and speeches delivered between the Rowlatt Satyagraha (1919) and the suspension of non-cooperation in February 1922. The pieces trace the escalation from constitutional petitions to mass civil disobedience, documenting Gandhi’s insistence that Swaraj must rest on personal discipline, Hindu–Muslim unity, and rejection of British honours and goods.

## Contents and Themes

The book opens with “Satyagraha versus Duragraha,” clarifying Gandhi’s moral vocabulary, then moves through sections on the Khilafat question, Punjab repression, constructive programmes, and the ethics of taxation boycotts. Gandhi threads autobiographical reflections—his South African experiments, legal training, and responses to governmental arrests—through analyses of spinning, village uplift, and communal harmony. The compilation’s episodic structure mirrors the rhythm of weekly journalism while cumulatively articulating a philosophy of nonviolent resistance.

## Historical Significance

*Freedom’s Battle* circulated widely among Congress volunteers and foreign sympathisers, offering a concise manifesto of the movement that would culminate in the Salt March a decade later. Its translation into multiple Indian languages and reprinting in diaspora presses helped internationalise the case for India’s self-determination. Historians cite the volume to track Gandhi’s evolving stance on violence, his response to the Chauri Chaura incident, and his attempts to balance radical mobilisation with constitutional negotiation.

## Public Domain Status

Gandhi died in 1948; the work entered the Indian public domain on 1 January 2009. First published in 1922, it is also in the public domain in the United States, enabling free circulation via Project Gutenberg and the Internet Archive scan referenced above.

## Research Directions

- Compare the Gutenberg transcription with the Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi (CWMG), Volume 24, to note editorial differences in headline wording and paragraphing.
- Analyse Gandhi’s references to Islamic jurisprudence in the Khilafat essays to explore how he frames interfaith solidarity.
- Map the book’s publication history across Navajivan, G. A. Natesan & Co., and international editions to understand non-cooperation’s print networks.
