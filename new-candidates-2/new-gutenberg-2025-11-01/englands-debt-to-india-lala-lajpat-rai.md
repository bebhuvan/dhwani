# England's Debt to India

## Overview

Written in exile in the United States during World War I, Lala Lajpat Rai’s treatise quantifies the economic “drain” imposed by British rule. Drawing on official statistics, he argues that imperial policies impoverished India through revenue extraction, exchange-rate manipulation, and discriminatory tariffs.

## Structure and Themes

The book surveys land revenue, salt and opium monopolies, military expenditure, and the impact of currency reforms from the East India Company era through the early twentieth century. Rai mobilises economic data to demonstrate how colonial budgets privileged Britain, proposing restitution and fiscal autonomy as prerequisites for justice.

## Historical and Cultural Significance

Published in 1917, the study reinforced Dadabhai Naoroji’s earlier drain theory and supplied nationalists with updated evidence for economic critique. It influenced debates at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, energised Home Rule advocacy, and later informed Gandhian and socialist economic programmes.

## Public Domain Status

Rai died in 1928, so the work entered India’s public domain on 1 January 1989. Its 1917 publication places it in the U.S. public domain as well. The Internet Archive scan reproduces the original G. Bell & Sons edition.

## Research Directions

- Compare Rai’s statistical methods with Naoroji’s and R. C. Dutt’s to map evolving nationalist economic analysis.
- Analyse British parliamentary debates and press responses to gauge imperial reactions to the book.
- Study how the treatise circulated among diaspora activists in North America and influenced transnational lobbying.
- Revisit Rai’s fiscal proposals in light of contemporary scholarship on colonial extraction and reparations.
