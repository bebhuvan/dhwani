# Medieval Mysticism of India

## Overview

Published 1929 by Shantinike tan Press, 256 pages. Comparative analysis of Indian medieval mystical movements spanning 12th-17th centuries. Examines Vaishnava bhakti (Chaitanya's Bengal movement, Mirabai's Rajasthani devotionalism, Vallabhacharya's Pushti Marga), Shaiva traditions (Kashmir Shaivism's non-dualism, Virashaiva social reform in Karnataka), Sufi orders (Chishti, Suhrawardi, Qadiri adaptation to Indian context), Nath yogi synthesis of Shaiva and Buddhist Tantra, Kabir's nirguna (formless) tradition rejecting Hindu-Muslim sectarianism, Nanak's Sikh synthesis, Dadu Dayal's Rajasthani sant tradition. Argues these movements shared structural features despite doctrinal differences: emphasis on personal divine experience over scriptural authority, rejection of ritual formalism and priestly mediation, vernacular poetry making teachings accessible beyond Sanskrit-educated elite, guru-disciple transmission outside institutional control, transcendence of caste and sectarian boundaries through universal divine love. Compares with European medieval mysticism—St. Francis of Assisi's poverty and nature mysticism, Meister Eckhart's apophatic theology, Rhineland mystics' vernacular writings—arguing mystical experience produces similar expressions across cultures. Based on Sen's decades researching medieval Hindi, Bengali, Punjabi, Marathi vernacular poetry at Rabindranath Tagore's Visva-Bharati University.

## About Kshitimohan Sen

Sen (1880-1960) born in Calcutta, studied at Scottish Church College and Presidency College. Joined Rabindranath Tagore's Shantiniketan school (1908), where he established Department of Indian Studies dedicated to medieval vernacular literature and bhakti traditions. Tagore appointed him principal of Vidya-Bhavan (1918-1950s), Visva-Bharati's humanities college. Specialized in Kabir, Dadu Dayal, Guru Nanak, medieval sant poetry. Published *Kabir's Philosophy* (1910), *Medieval Mysticism of India* (1929), *Hinduism* (1961), numerous Bengali scholarly works. Father of Amartya Sen (Nobel Prize economist), who credited his father's pluralistic approach to Indian traditions with shaping his own scholarship. Kshitimohan's methodology combined textual scholarship of medieval vernacular poetry with ethnographic fieldwork among contemporary sant lineages, documenting oral transmission of mystical teachings. Close collaboration with Tagore shaped mutual influence—Sen's research informed Tagore's religious poetry, while Tagore's universalist philosophy influenced Sen's comparative approach to mysticism. Died 1960, having established academic respectability for studying vernacular bhakti traditions previously dismissed as folk religion by Sanskrit-focused Indologists.

## Historical Context

Medieval Indian mystical movements (12th-17th centuries) emerged during Islamic sultanate establishment and Mughal rule, producing Hindu-Muslim synthesis traditions. Vaishnava bhakti spread from Tamil Alvars (6th-9th centuries) northward through Ramanuja's systematization, reaching peak with Chaitanya's Bengal movement (1486-1534) and Vallabhacharya's Pushti Marga (1479-1531). Shaiva traditions included Kashmir Shaivism's non-dualistic philosophy (9th-12th centuries) and Basava's Virashaiva social reform (12th century Karnataka). Sufi orders—Chishti (Moinuddin Chishti d.1236, Nizamuddin Auliya d.1325), Suhrawardi, Qadiri—adapted Middle Eastern Islamic mysticism to Indian devotional contexts, incorporating music, poetry, shrine practices. Sant tradition synthesized these streams: Kabir (1398-1518) rejected Hindu-Muslim sectarian divisions through nirguna devotion, Nanak (1469-1539) founded Sikhism combining Hindu and Islamic elements, Dadu Dayal (1544-1603) established Rajasthani sant lineage. Sen's work (1929) appeared during nationalist movement, arguing these medieval movements demonstrated India's historical capacity for religious pluralism and social reform, countering colonial claims that Hinduism remained static until British intervention introduced progress.

## Content and Themes

**Vaishnava Bhakti**: Examines devotional traditions worshipping Vishnu/Krishna through love-focused practices. Chaitanya's Bengal movement using kirtan (devotional singing), Mirabai's transgressive renunciation defying royal family, Vallabhacharya's aesthetic devotionalism emphasizing divine play (lila). Details theological evolution from qualified non-dualism (Ramanuja) through dualistic bhakti (Madhva) to Chaitanya's inconceivable difference-and-non-difference (achintya-bheda-abheda).

**Shaiva Traditions**: Contrasts Kashmir Shaivism's sophisticated non-dualistic philosophy (Abhinavagupta's Tantraloka) with Virashaiva social radicalism rejecting Brahmin ritual authority, caste distinctions, gender segregation. Examines Basava's ishtalinga practice making every devotee temple priest.

**Sufism in India**: Traces Sufi orders' adaptation to Indian context. Chishti emphasis on music (sama) resonated with Indian devotional traditions. Examination of Nizamuddin Auliya's Delhi dargah, Moinuddin Chishti's Ajmer shrine. Documents Hindu-Muslim spiritual exchanges—Sufis adopting Hindu yogic practices, Hindus visiting Sufi shrines.

**Sant Synthesis**: Focuses on Kabir's paradoxical poetry rejecting both Hindu and Muslim orthodoxies: criticizes caste system and temple rituals while mocking mosque prayers and Quranic literalism. Argues for formless divine transcending sectarian labels. Examines transmission through oral tradition among weaver communities.

**Comparative Analysis**: Compares Indian mysticism with European medieval counterparts. St. Francis's nature mysticism and poverty vows paralleled Nath yogis' renunciation. Meister Eckhart's apophatic theology ("God beyond God") resembles Kabir's nirguna formlessness. Rhineland mystics' German vernacular writings parallel sant tradition's Hindi/Punjabi poetry democratizing religious knowledge.

**Social Reform**: Analyzes mystical movements' challenge to social hierarchies. Virashaivas' caste rejection, Mirabai's upper-caste woman renouncing palatial life for wandering bhakti, Kabir's weaver caste claiming spiritual authority over Brahmins, Nanak's langar (community kitchen) abolishing caste dining restrictions.

## Significance

**Bhakti Studies Pioneer**: Established academic framework for studying bhakti as pan-Indian phenomenon rather than isolated regional movements. Influenced subsequent scholarship on medieval devotional traditions—A.K. Ramanujan, John Stratton Hawley, Wendy Doniger, David Lorenzen built upon Sen's foundations.

**Comparative Mysticism**: Pioneered comparing Indian and European mystical traditions, arguing mystical experience produces cross-cultural structural similarities despite doctrinal differences. Influenced Mircea Eliade, Evelyn Underhill, R.C. Zaehner's comparative mysticism research.

**Vernacular Literature**: Established scholarly legitimacy for studying medieval Hindi, Bengali, Punjabi, Marathi devotional poetry previously dismissed as folk literature by Sanskrit-focused Indology. Demonstrated vernacular texts contained sophisticated theology and social commentary requiring serious academic engagement.

**Religious Pluralism**: Argued medieval mystical movements demonstrated India's historical capacity for Hindu-Muslim synthesis and religious tolerance, countering colonial narratives of inevitable religious conflict requiring British mediation. Influenced nationalist discourse emphasizing composite culture.

**Tagore Collaboration**: Mutual influence with Rabindranath Tagore shaped both figures' work. Sen's research on Kabir/Nanak informed Tagore's religious poetry collections (*Gitanjali*, *Songs of Kabir* translations). Tagore's universalist philosophy influenced Sen's comparative methodology.

**Academic Methodology**: Combined textual analysis of medieval manuscripts with ethnographic fieldwork among contemporary sant lineages, pioneering methodology later adopted by religious studies scholars. Documented oral transmission of mystical teachings alongside written texts.
