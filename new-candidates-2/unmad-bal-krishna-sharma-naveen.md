# Unmad (Frenzy)

## Overview

Published 1938 by Kashi Nagari Pracharini Sabha, Varanasi, 200+ pages containing 40 poems. Establishes Bal Krishna Sharma 'Naveen' as major Chhayavadi poet alongside Jayshankar Prasad, Sumitrananda Pant, Suryakant Tripathi Nirala, Mahadevi Verma. Title *Unmad*—divine frenzy or inspired madness—reflects Romantic aesthetic privileging passionate emotion over rational control, echoing Plato's concept of poetic inspiration and Romantic theories of imagination. Poems characterized by intense emotional expression, nature mysticism treating landscape as spiritual force, longing for transcendence beyond material existence, veiled nationalist sentiment during British colonial rule. Formal features include *chhand* (traditional Hindi meters) adapted for lyrical rather than narrative purposes, rich Sanskrit *tatsama* vocabulary creating elevated register, sound patterns (*anuprasa* alliteration, *yamaka* homophony) producing musicality. Influenced by English Romantics—Shelley's revolutionary idealism, Keats's sensuous imagery, Wordsworth's nature philosophy—and Bengali Renaissance, especially Tagore's *Gitanjali*. However, creates distinctly Hindi voice through prosody, cultural references, linguistic textures. Addresses Indian independence movement obliquely: nature imagery symbolizing freedom versus bondage, dawn/awakening metaphors suggesting national consciousness, storm/revolution motifs. Direct political statement avoided due to colonial censorship but symbolic register conveyed nationalist sentiment to contemporary readers.

## About Bal Krishna Sharma 'Naveen'

Naveen (1897-1960) born in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh. Pen name *Naveen* (new/young) signaled modernizing impulse within Hindi literature. Educated in traditional Sanskrit scholarship plus modern English literature, enabling synthesis of Indian classical poetics with Western Romantic aesthetics. Active in independence movement, participated in Non-Cooperation and Civil Disobedience campaigns. Poetry reflected nationalist commitment while maintaining artistic sophistication avoiding crude propaganda. Published multiple poetry collections: *Rashmi* (1924), *Unmad* (1938), *Kwaish* (1946), *Apara* (1957). Contemporaneous with other Chhayavad pioneers—Prasad, Pant, Nirala, Mahadevi—collectively transforming Hindi poetry from didactic, narrative *Dvivedi-yug* style (late 19th-early 20th century) to lyrical, introspective, aesthetically refined modernism. Worked as Hindi professor at Gwalior, combining creative writing with academic scholarship. Died 1960, having established Romantic lyricism as central Hindi poetic mode influencing subsequent generations.

## Historical Context

Chhayavad movement (approximately 1918-1938, though dates debated) revolutionized Hindi literature. Name derives from *chhaya* (shadow/reflection), suggesting poetry reflecting inner emotional/spiritual states versus external material reality. Emerged during pivotal period: post-WWI disillusionment, Gandhi's Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-22), growing nationalist consciousness, modernization's cultural impacts. Previous *Dvivedi-yug* poetry (named for critic Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi) emphasized social reform, moral instruction, historical narratives in relatively prosaic language. Chhayavad introduced: introspective lyric focus, mystical/spiritual themes, nature as spiritual force, refined aesthetic language, intricate prosody, women's voices (Mahadevi Verma pioneering women's literary authority). Influenced by multiple sources: English Romantics studied in colonial education system, Tagore's Bengali Romantic poetry (*Gitanjali* won Nobel Prize 1913), Sanskrit *kavya* aesthetic theories (rasa, dhvani), Hindi bhakti devotional poetry (Surdas, Tulsidas), German Romantic idealism. *Unmad's* 1938 publication came at Chhayavad's mature phase, shortly before Progressive Writers' Movement (late 1930s onward) shifted Hindi literature toward social realism and explicit political engagement. Naveen's collection represented Romantic aesthetic's full development before its partial displacement by socialist-realist imperatives.

## Content and Themes

**Nature Mysticism**: Mountains, rivers, forests, storms, dawn, stars treated not as mere scenery but spiritual forces embodying cosmic consciousness. Nature becomes vehicle for transcendental experience, pathway to divine, mirror of inner emotional states. Wordsworth's influence evident but adapted to Hindi cultural context—Himalayan rather than Lake District imagery, Indian flora/fauna, monsoon rather than English seasons.

**Spiritual Longing**: Soul's yearning for union with absolute, transcendence beyond material existence, dissolution of individual ego into universal consciousness. Combines Hindu Vedantic concepts (*atman-brahman* identity, *maya* illusion) with Romantic infinite aspiration. Neither strictly religious nor secular but occupies liminal devotional-aesthetic space.

**Romantic Love**: Beloved addressed through *nayika-bheda* classical typologies but infused with Romantic individualized passion. Love becomes path to spiritual realization, earthly beloved shadows cosmic beloved. Emotional intensity celebrating feeling's authenticity versus social convention's artificiality.

**Nationalist Symbolism**: Freedom symbolized through natural imagery—caged bird desiring sky, river breaking barriers, dawn after darkness, spring awakening after winter. Storm/thunder motifs suggest revolutionary transformation. Poems function on dual registers—surface nature mysticism, beneath political allegory comprehensible to contemporary nationalist readers.

**Temporal Consciousness**: Tension between eternal/transient, desire for permanence in impermanent world, memory's preservation versus time's destruction, historical cycles. Reflects both Hindu concepts of cyclical time and modern linear historical consciousness of progress, decline, renewal.

**Poetic Inspiration**: Metapoetic reflections on creative process—*unmad* (frenzy) as divine possession enabling poetic vision, ordinary consciousness insufficient for truth perception, imagination's power transcending empirical reality. Romantic theory of poet as prophet/visionary.

## Significance

**Chhayavad Canonization**: Established Naveen alongside Prasad, Pant, Nirala, Mahadevi as defining Chhayavad voices. *Unmad* studied in Hindi literature curricula as representative Romantic text demonstrating movement's aesthetic principles, technical innovations, thematic concerns.

**Hindi Prosodic Innovation**: Demonstrated *chhand* traditional meters' capacity for lyrical rather than narrative purposes. Complex sound patterning, enjambment breaking syntactic units across lines, caesura placement creating musical effects. Influenced subsequent Hindi prosody making lyric central rather than peripheral form.

**Nationalist Literature**: Contributed to cultural nationalism through elevated Hindi literary production. Demonstrated Hindi's capacity for aesthetically sophisticated, philosophically profound poetry comparable to Bengali or English, supporting claims for Hindi's status as national language. Symbolic register allowed nationalist sentiment expression despite colonial censorship.

**Sanskrit-Hindi Synthesis**: Integrated Sanskrit *tatsama* vocabulary, classical *kavya* aesthetic concepts, traditional *chhand* meters with modern Romantic subjectivity, individualism, nature philosophy. Created continuity with classical tradition while achieving modernity, resolving tension between traditionalism and modernization.

**Educational Canon**: Included in Hindi school/university curricula throughout North India. Generations of students memorize poems, analyze imagery, study prosody using *Unmad* as exemplary text. Shaped popular understanding of what constitutes "good poetry."

**Women Readers**: Despite male authorship, Romantic inwardness, emotional intensity, spiritual longing resonated with female readers. Mahadevi Verma cited Naveen's influence, suggesting cross-gender aesthetic appreciation within Chhayavad's valorization of traditionally "feminine" emotional interiority.

**Literary Language**: Elevated Hindi literary register through rich vocabulary, complex syntax, allusive density. Set standards for *sahityik Hindi* (literary Hindi) distinct from colloquial *boli* or administrative *raj-bhasha*, establishing hierarchy later contested by progressive realist writers advocating accessible language.

**Comparative Studies**: Enabled productive comparison with European Romanticism, Bengali Renaissance, classical Sanskrit *kavya*, medieval bhakti poetry. Scholars analyze how Naveen adapted multiple traditions creating distinctly Hindi modernism irreducible to any single influence.
