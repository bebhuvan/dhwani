# War Without Violence: A Study of Gandhi's Method and Its Accomplishments

## Overview

Published 1939 by Harcourt Brace, 342 pages. First comprehensive analysis of Gandhian non-violent resistance written for Western audiences by participant-observer. Shridharani served as Gandhi's secretary and participated in 1930 Dandi Salt March before studying at New York University (PhD, sociology). Three-part structure: Part I chronicles Gandhi's life 1869-1939, focusing on development of satyagraha through South African campaigns (1893-1914) and Indian independence movement. Part II analyzes non-violence theory—philosophical foundations, tactical principles, psychological mechanisms, organizational requirements. Part III examines practical applications to labor organizing, anti-colonial movements, international conflict resolution. Published during rising European fascism and American isolationism debates, argued non-violent resistance represented viable alternative to both military force and passive acceptance of injustice. Introduced English terms "non-violent resistance" and "civil disobedience" that became standard political vocabulary. Contrasts satyagraha with passive resistance, arguing former requires active courage and disciplined strategy rather than weakness or moral posturing.

## About Krishnalal Shridharani

Shridharani (1911-1960) born in Gujarat, participated in independence movement as teenager. Imprisoned multiple times for political activities, served as Gandhi's secretary at Sabarmati Ashram. After release, traveled to America for graduate studies—BA from NYU, MA from Columbia University in journalism, PhD from NYU in sociology. Dissertation became *War Without Violence*. Remained in America, working as journalist, lecturer, and writer. Published novels, poetry, and political analysis. Later works include *My India, My America* (1941), comparing American and Indian cultures, and *The Mahatma and the World* (1946). Returned to India 1960, died same year in Bombay at 49. Unique perspective combined insider knowledge of Gandhian methods with Western social science training, enabling translation between Indian political practice and Western academic frameworks.

## Historical Context

Gandhi developed satyagraha between 1893-1914 in South Africa resisting discriminatory laws against Indian community. Refined methods during Indian independence campaigns: 1920-22 Non-Cooperation Movement, 1930 Salt March, 1942 Quit India Movement. By late 1930s, Western intellectuals debated non-violence in context of rising fascism—whether non-violent resistance could effectively oppose totalitarian regimes employing systematic violence. Shridharani wrote as Hitler occupied Czechoslovakia and threatened Poland; American isolationists opposed intervention while interventionists argued military force represented only effective response to fascism. Book argued non-violent resistance offered third path—neither passive acceptance nor military escalation. Publication coincided with American labor movement's use of sit-down strikes, which Shridharani analyzed as non-violent direct action applying Gandhian principles to industrial conflict.

## Content and Structure

**Part I - Gandhi's Biography**: Traces development from conventional lawyer to revolutionary tactician. Chronicles Tolstoy Farm experiments (South Africa), Champaran satyagraha (1917, first Indian application), Dandi March (1930, breaking salt monopoly). Emphasizes Gandhi's pragmatism—adapting tactics to specific situations rather than applying rigid formula.

**Part II - Theory of Non-Violence**: Distinguishes satyagraha (truth-force) from passive resistance. Analyzes psychological mechanisms: moral jiu-jitsu turning opponent's violence into political liability, third-party witness effect creating public pressure, opponent humanization through suffering voluntarily accepted. Discusses organizational requirements: discipline, training, leadership, propaganda, mass participation.

**Part III - Practical Applications**: Examines labor organizing (American sit-down strikes as non-violent direct action), anti-colonial movements (Irish independence, Indian campaigns), international conflict (hypothetical applications to European situation). Analyzes successes and failures, conditions favoring non-violent methods, limitations when facing opponents willing to employ unlimited violence.

**Comparative Analysis**: Contrasts non-violence with pacifism (which accepts injustice), violent revolution (which creates new oppression), and conventional politics (which accepts systemic violence). Argues satyagraha represents active resistance requiring greater courage than armed conflict.

## Significance

**Civil Rights Movement Influence**: Martin Luther King Jr. read extensively before Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955-56), citing as major influence on his philosophy. King's application of Gandhian methods to American racial segregation demonstrated cross-cultural transferability of non-violent resistance techniques. James Farmer (CORE founder), James Lawson (Nashville sit-ins organizer), and other civil rights leaders studied Shridharani's tactical analysis.

**Political Vocabulary**: Introduced "non-violent resistance" and "civil disobedience" as standard English political terms, replacing vague "passive resistance" with precise tactical concepts. Scholarly analysis of satyagraha's mechanisms influenced social movement studies, peace research, conflict resolution fields.

**Translation Achievement**: Bridged Indian political practice and Western academic discourse by presenting satyagraha in sociological frameworks accessible to Western readers while preserving philosophical foundations rooted in Hindu concepts (ahimsa, tapasya, brahmacharya).

**Historical Documentation**: Provided contemporaneous account of Gandhian campaigns by direct participant, documenting tactical details often omitted from official histories. Chapters on Dandi March, Non-Cooperation Movement, prison experiences preserve eyewitness testimony of independence movement.

**Academic Reception**: Established satyagraha as legitimate subject for scholarly analysis in Western universities. Prior Western treatments often dismissed Gandhi's methods as exotic mysticism; Shridharani's sociological framework enabled serious academic engagement with non-violent resistance theory.
