# New History of the Marathas, Volume 1: Shivaji and His Line (1600–1707)

## Overview

Phoenix Publications issued the first edition in 1946, with a second impression in 1957 that leaves the original pagination intact (title verso, Archive scan). Sardesai organises 26 chapters that proceed from linguistic and geographic groundwork through Shahaji Bhonsle’s Bijapur service, Shivaji’s coronation, and the protracted Mughal siege warfare against Sambhaji, Rajaram, and Tarabai (table of contents, Archive scan, ff. 17–20). Each chapter interleaves narrative with translated documents from the Peshwa Daftar and Portuguese, Dutch, and English correspondence, showing how fort logistics, revenue settlements, and diplomatic envoys sustained Maratha offensives. Extensive appendices supply genealogies, maps, and documentary transcriptions that make the 489-page volume a sourcebook as much as a synthesized history.

## About the Author

Govind Sakharam Sardesai (1865–1959) managed the Baroda State Record Office, where he catalogued and published the multi-volume *Selections from the Peshwa Daftar*. His Marathi series *Marathi Riyasat* (1925–35) established him as the preeminent historian of the Maratha polity, and *New History of the Marathas* reworked that archival labour into an English-language trilogy aimed at scholars and the wider public. Sardesai’s historical method—collating Persian farmāns, Marathi letters, European travel reports, administrative orders, and family records—helped normalise document-driven regional history in late colonial India (preface, Archive scan, ff. 5–8).

## Historical Context

The trilogy appeared while nationalist and colonial narratives about the Marathas were sharply polarised. British historians such as Grant Duff had characterised the confederacy as a disruptive cavalry state, whereas nationalist biographies often imagined Shivaji as a lone heroic resistor. Sardesai spent the 1930s editing Daftar volumes expressly to correct both extremes. Volume 1 demonstrates that the Bhonsle court operated a multilingual chancery, negotiated treaty regimes, financed naval experiments, and coordinated guerrilla campaigns that frustrated Aurangzeb’s Deccan occupation between 1681 and 1707. Because Sardesai died in 1959, the Indian copyright term (life plus 60 years) expired on 1 January 2020; the book therefore sits in the public domain in India, though Uruguay Round restoration keeps the 1946 Indian edition under copyright in the United States until 2041.

## Literary & Cultural Significance

- **Documentary baseline:** Sardesai reproduces Marathi orders, Persian dispatches, and European factory letters, supplying references that later scholars (e.g., Stewart Gordon, Sumit Guha) continue to cite for campaign chronology, revenue mechanisms (*chauth*, *sardeshmukhi*), and provincial administration.
- **Reframing Shivaji:** By mapping guerrilla warfare to logistics, fort hydrology, and diplomacy, the book counters colonial caricatures of Maratha raiding and nationalist hagiography alike, presenting statecraft as a collective enterprise sustained by monarchs, regents, scribes, and district-level commanders.
- **Regional historiography template:** The narrative shows how a regional empire can be written from vernacular archives without subordinating itself to Mughal or British master narratives, making the trilogy a methodological model for subsequent subnational histories.
