# Studies in Indian Social Polity

## Overview

Purabi Publishers released the first edition in July 1944, priced at six rupees and printed by Gupta Press, Calcutta (imprint, Archive scan, ff. 1–2). Across 29 chapters and more than 550 pages, Datta surveys caste, kinship, village panchayats, guild-like organisations, urban associations, labour movements, education, law, and administrative structures. The opening chapters set out the comparative method—insisting that caste evolved internally rather than solely through Aryan–Dravidian racial conflict—while later sections juxtapose Indian institutions with European class systems, Soviet organisation, and East Asian models (preface, Archive scan, ff. 3–8). Tables and appendices collate census figures, labour data, and legal excerpts so that normative arguments rest on documentary evidence.

## About the Author

Bhupendranath Datta (1880–1961) was a revolutionary activist, sociologist, and younger brother of Swami Vivekananda. Educated at Brown University and the University of Hamburg, he blended Marxian analysis with comparative anthropology in works such as *Vivekananda: Patriot-Prophet* (1954) and *Dynamics of Indian Society* (1958). During the 1930s–40s he wrote extensively for *Man in India*, *Calcutta Review*, and nationalist dailies, arguing that nation-building required a sociological audit of caste, land tenure, industrial labour, and educational access. His academic training and radical politics converge in *Studies in Indian Social Polity*, which reworks earlier journal articles into a coherent monograph (preface, Archive scan, ff. 6–8).

## Historical Context

The book appeared during World War II, when Bengal was coping with famine, wartime inflation, and debates about post-war reconstruction. Datta critiques racialised Indology as inadequate for planning, instead situating Indian caste and class within global patterns of economic stratification. He quotes European and American sociologists (Vierkandt, Bouglé, Ward), Soviet archaeological findings, and Indian census commissioners to argue that caste stratification is neither immutable nor unique. Because Datta died in 1961, the volume entered the Indian public domain on 1 January 2022. However, Uruguay Round restoration leaves the 1944 Calcutta publication under U.S. copyright until 2039, so Dhwani should treat the work as PD only in jurisdictions following life-plus-60 or shorter terms.

## Literary & Cultural Significance

- **Comparative sociology in India:** Datta insists that caste and class be analysed through global frameworks rather than colonial race theory, helping to inaugurate an indigenous tradition of sociological comparison just before India’s independence.
- **Policy relevance:** Chapters on agrarian tenancy, labour organisation, and education translate academic findings into proposals for cooperative credit, industrial welfare, and curricular reform—linking scholarship to development planning.
- **Archival synthesis:** The work consolidates data from colonial surveys, vernacular sources, and international scholarship, giving later researchers a single reference point for debates about caste reform, rural governance, and industrial labour in late colonial Bengal.
