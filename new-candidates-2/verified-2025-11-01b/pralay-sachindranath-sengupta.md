# Pralay (প্রলয়)

## Overview

Sachindranath Sengupta finished *Pralay* twenty days after the Bihar earthquake of 15 January 1934, transforming fresh disaster reportage into a four-act relief-camp drama (author’s note, Archive scan, ff. 9–12). The play was first staged at Calcutta’s Rangmahal Theatre by The Stage Producers under Birendrakrishna Bhadra’s direction and Jamini Mitra’s production design. Its opening sequence uses sound cues behind a drop curtain to recreate tremors before the action settles inside a makeshift encampment. Refugees, volunteers, and opportunists—Susthir, Ashok, Sita, Amar, Bholanath, Nistarini, and others—debate survival, faith, property, and mutual aid while aftershocks and scarcity keep the community on edge. The script couples lyrical ensemble passages with realistic debates about food distribution, burial rites, rebuilding, and women’s labour, creating a snapshot of 1930s humanitarian theatre.

## About the Author

Sachindranath Sengupta (1891–1961) was a leading dramatist of the Bengali group-theatre movement. A founding editor of *Natya-Niketan*, he wrote plays such as *Tatinir Bichar* (1913), *Rakta Sandhya* (1933), and *Pralay* that infused melodrama with social critique. He collaborated with directors staging proscenium productions and All India Radio broadcasts, helping shape political theatre in interwar Bengal. Banglapedia notes that Sengupta’s oeuvre tracks the evolution of modern Bengali drama from mythic allegory to socially anchored realism.

## Historical Context

The 1934 Bihar–Nepal earthquake killed thousands and displaced entire districts. Relief camps run by student volunteers, nationalist organisations, and government officials became arenas for debates about charity, caste, and state responsibility. Sengupta’s preface thanks Birendrakrishna Bhadra and the Stage Producers troupe for mounting the play and offers staging advice for muktamnacha (open-air) troupes, signalling an intention that the script circulate beyond Calcutta. The publication by Gopal Das Majumdar (42 Cornwallis Street, Calcutta) and printing at Alexander Printing Works document the thriving Bengali theatre press of the 1930s (title page and colophon, Archive scan, ff. 1–4). With Sengupta’s death in 1961, the drama entered the Indian public domain on 1 January 2022, though U.S. rights remain active until 2027 under Uruguay Round restoration.

## Literary & Cultural Significance

- **Disaster realism:** *Pralay* treats the earthquake not as backdrop but as ongoing condition; sustained sound design, interrupted rituals, and improvised shelter convey collective trauma and the fragile ethics of relief work.
- **Group-theatre pedagogy:** Sengupta’s introduction explains how amateur troupes can stage tremor effects, adjust lighting, and choreograph ensemble scenes, illustrating how Bengali group theatre blended artistic ambition with practical instruction for volunteer companies.
- **Social critique:** Characters personify conflicting responses—religious fatalism, revolutionary impatience, black-market opportunism, matriarchal resilience—allowing the play to interrogate caste hierarchies, gendered care labour, and the politics of charity in crisis-era Bengal.
