description: "Kumārasambhavam (Sanskrit: कुमारसम्भवम् ) (transl. - \"The Birth of Kumāra\") is an epic poem by Kālidāsa. It is widely regarded as the finest work of Kalidasa as well as the greatest kāvya poem in Classical Sanskrit. sical Sanskrit. The style of description of spring set the standard for nature metaphors pervading many centuries of Indian literary tradition. Kumārasaṃbhavam basically talks about the birth of Kumāra (Kārtikeya), the son of Shiva (Śiva) and Pārvatī (Umā). The period of composition is uncertain, although Kalidasa is thought to have lived in the 5th century. A fierce debate has raged over the question as to whether the whole of the seventeen cantos came was penned by Kalidasa. Vitthala Śastrin, who in 1866, published Cantos VIII to XVII in The Paņdit, took them as genuine work of Kalidasa whil Despite these criticisms, many regard Canto VIII as the pinnacle of Kalidasa's poetic mastery, and it is cited more frequently in major critical works like the Alaṃkārasutra and the Sarasvatīkaṇṭhābharaṇa, than any other canto."
