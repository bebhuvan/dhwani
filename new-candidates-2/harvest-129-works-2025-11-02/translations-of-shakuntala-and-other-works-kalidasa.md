description: "Shakuntala (Sanskrit: शकुन्तला, romanized: Śakuntalā) is a heroine in ancient Indian literature, best known for her portrayal in the ancient Sanskrit play Abhijnanashakuntalam (The Recognition of Shakuntala), written by the classical poet Kalidasa in the 4th or 5th century AD. Her story, however, originates in the Hindu epic, the Mahabharata (c. 400 BC - 400 AD), where she appears in the Adi Parva (\"The Book of Beginnings\"). with poetic elegance but reimagines Shakuntala as a more passive and naive figure. In this version, her introduction to King Dushyanta is made by her friends, Priyamvada and Anasuya. After Dushyanta departs from the hermitage, Shakuntala, lost in thoughts of him, fails to greet the irascible sage Durvasa, who curses her so that Dushyanta will forget her entirely. The curse can only be lifted if he Shakuntala has long been regarded as a significant cultural figure and a symbol of Indian womanhood, inspiring numerous literary, artistic, and visual adaptations."
