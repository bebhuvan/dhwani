# Bangiya Shabdakosh (Bengali Dictionary) Volume 1

## Overview

Volume 1 published 1932 by Sahitya Akademi, Calcutta, covering অ-আ (a-ā) letters across 2,300+ pages. First of five volumes (1932-1953) containing 180,000+ total entries constituting most comprehensive Bengali dictionary. Combines dictionary (definitions), encyclopedia (biographical/geographical/conceptual entries), thesaurus (synonyms), and etymological reference functions. Each entry provides: word spelling, pronunciation guide, part of speech, etymology tracing Sanskrit/Prakrit/Pali/foreign sources, multiple definitions ordered by frequency, extensive literary quotations demonstrating usage from 10th-century Charyapada through 20th-century modern writers, variant spellings across regions/periods, related words, synonyms, encyclopedic elaboration for proper nouns and complex concepts. Includes technical terminology from traditional knowledge systems: Ayurvedic medical terms, astrological concepts, Nyaya philosophical vocabulary, music theory terminology, architectural terms, agricultural implements, ritual objects. Documents regional dialectical variants from East Bengal (now Bangladesh), West Bengal, Assam's Bengali-speaking areas, Tripura. 26-year compilation project by single author Haricharan Bandopadhyaya without institutional funding or research assistants—remarkable individual scholarly achievement. First major Bengali-Bengali dictionary produced by Bengali scholar; earlier dictionaries by European missionaries (William Carey 1825, J.J. Mendies 1829) served missionary translation needs rather than comprehensive linguistic documentation.

## About Haricharan Bandopadhyaya

Bandopadhyaya (1867-1959) born in Hooghly district, West Bengal. Educated at Hooghly College. Worked as schoolteacher while pursuing lexicographic research over decades. Began collecting Bengali vocabulary systematically in 1906, completing fifth volume 1953 age 86. Financed publication through personal funds and subscriptions, without institutional sponsorship from universities or government. Received minimal recognition during lifetime despite work's scholarly magnitude. Posthumous appreciation came with Bengali linguistic scholarship's expansion recognizing his foundational contribution. Methodology combined traditional Sanskrit lexicographic practices (*kosha* tradition) with European dictionary models. Read extensively across Bengali literature—medieval manuscripts, 19th-century novels, newspapers, folk literature, scientific texts—to document actual usage rather than prescriptive norms. Corresponded with scholars across Bengal collecting regional variants and technical terminology. Died 1959, two years before Sahitya Akademi Award establishment—would have been prime candidate. His solitary decades-long dedication without institutional support exemplifies individual scholarly commitment producing works of lasting value.

## Historical Context

Bengali lexicography began with colonialism's linguistic documentation needs. William Carey's *Dictionary of the Bengali Language* (1825) and J.J. Mendies's *English and Bengali Dictionary* (1829) served missionary Bible translation rather than Bengali linguistic development documentation. These English-Bengali dictionaries treated Bengali as object of foreign study. Late 19th-century Bengal Renaissance witnessed cultural nationalism demanding indigenous intellectual production. Haricharan conceived comprehensive Bengali-Bengali dictionary establishing Bengali's linguistic autonomy—demonstrating Bengali possessed vocabulary richness, historical depth, technical precision comparable to Sanskrit or English. Project began 1906 during Swadeshi movement (1905-1911) when cultural nationalism emphasized indigenous knowledge production. Continued through turbulent decades: World War I, Non-Cooperation Movement (1920-22), Great Depression, World War II, Bengal Famine (1943), Partition (1947), Indian independence. Haricharan persisted despite political upheavals, economic hardships, lack of institutional support. Publication of final volume (1953) came six years post-independence, contributing to newly independent India's cultural consolidation by documenting major regional language's comprehensive lexicon.

## Content and Method

**Entry Types**: (1) Common words with definitions, etymology, usage examples. (2) Biographical entries for historical figures, authors, saints, political leaders. (3) Geographical entries for regions, rivers, cities, pilgrimage sites. (4) Conceptual entries for philosophical terms, religious concepts, social institutions. (5) Technical terminology from traditional sciences.

**Literary Quotations**: Extensive quotations demonstrating usage across centuries. Charyapada (10th-century Buddhist mystical poems), Vidyapati (14th-century Maithili-Bengali devotional poetry), Chandidas (15th-century Vaishnava poetry), Krittibas (15th-century Ramayana translation), Mukundaram (16th-century Chandimangal), Bharatchandra (18th-century Annada Mangal), Ishwar Chandra Gupta (19th-century poetry), Bankim Chandra Chatterjee (19th-century novels), Rabindranath Tagore (modern literature), Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay, Nazrul Islam. Shows semantic evolution through literary history.

**Etymology**: Traces words to Sanskrit (*tatsama* direct borrowings, *tadbhava* Prakrit-transformed derivatives), Persian/Arabic (Islamic period loanwords), Portuguese (colonial trade terms), English (modern administrative/technical vocabulary), tribal languages (Austroasiatic substrate words), regional languages (Oriya, Assamese, Hindi borrowings).

**Regional Variants**: Documents East Bengal dialects (now Bangladesh), West Bengal standard Bengali, Northern Bengali variants (Rangpur, Rajshahi), Sylheti forms, Chittagonian vocabulary. Preserves dialectical diversity threatened by standardization.

**Encyclopedic Elaboration**: Entries for mythological figures include story summaries, textual references, regional variations. Geographical entries provide historical information, economic activities, demographic data. Philosophical terms explain concepts within systems (Vedanta, Nyaya, Tantra, Vaishnava theology).

**Traditional Knowledge**: Ayurvedic medical terminology with Sanskrit equivalents, astrological concepts, music theory terms (raga names, tala structures), architectural vocabulary, agricultural implements, textile types, food preparations, ritual objects, kinship terminology—documenting material culture through language.

## Significance

**Lexicographic Foundation**: Established methodological standards for Bengali lexicography. Subsequent dictionaries (Jnanendramohan Das's *Bangla Bhasha Prakash*, Rajshekhar Basu's *Chalantika*, Samsad dictionaries) built upon Haricharan's comprehensive documentation while offering different formats.

**Literary Scholarship**: Essential tool for studying Bengali literature. Scholars use for understanding archaic vocabulary in medieval texts, tracing semantic shifts, identifying literary allusions, dating manuscripts based on vocabulary. Enables modern readers to access pre-modern Bengali literature requiring glossing.

**Cultural Documentation**: Preserved knowledge of material culture, social practices, religious rituals, traditional sciences that might have been lost with modernization. Entries documenting rural agricultural implements, folk ritual objects, regional customs provide ethnographic data.

**Linguistic Nationalism**: Demonstrated Bengali's lexical richness and historical depth, countering colonial-era assumptions about "vernacular" inadequacy. Contributed to Bengali linguistic pride and standardization efforts post-Partition, serving both West Bengal and Bangladesh.

**Historical Source**: Provides historical information through biographical/geographical entries. Sometimes only accessible source for minor historical figures, forgotten localities, obsolete social practices documented through vocabulary.

**Educational Resource**: Used in Bengali language teaching, literary studies programs, translation studies. Students studying classical Bengali literature depend on Haricharan for vocabulary acquisition. Translators working between Bengali and other languages consult for finding precise equivalents.
