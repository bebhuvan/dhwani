# Indian Epigraphy

## Overview

Published in 1965, this handbook synthesizes a century of South Asian epigraphic practice into a usable method. It defines the principal scripts (early Brahmi, Kharosthi, Gupta and later regional hands), standardizes transliteration and editorial symbols, and sets out how to extract historical data—names, regnal years, titulature, donation formulas—from stone and copper-plate records.

## Edition Notes

- Reported year: 1965 (first edition)
- Medium: methodological manual with examples; includes plates and facsimiles (verify pagination and plate list from the scan)
- Scope: scripts (Brahmi, Kharosthi, Gupta), languages (Prakrit, Sanskrit, early Dravidian), genres (royal charters, donative records, land grants)
- Source: https://archive.org/details/indianepigraphy0000sirc

## About the Author

D. C. Sircar (1907–1984) worked in the Government of India's epigraphy service and later taught at the University of Calcutta. As editor of Epigraphia Indica and author of Select Inscriptions, he helped standardize dating conventions, transliteration schemes, and citation practice used across Indian historical studies.

## The Work

- Method: establishes procedures for reading, expanding, and translating damaged or formulaic texts; explains editorial signs, restorations, and abbreviations.
- Scripts and Palaeography: outlines letter-form evolution from early Brahmi and Kharosthi through Gupta and regional scripts; correlates ductus with approximate centuries.
- Formulae and Titles: catalogs standard epithets, land-measure and boundary terms, and donation clauses in Sanskrit and Prakrit; clarifies metrological and calendrical vocabulary.
- Records and Media: distinguishes stone, pillar, seal and sealing, and copper-plate charters; notes layout, seals, ring construction, and witness lists relevant to authentication.
- Use in History: demonstrates how inscriptions anchor political chronologies, administrative geographies, and social/legal practices otherwise absent from literary sources.

## Historical Context

Mid-twentieth-century epigraphy consolidated earlier corpora (Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum; Epigraphia Indica) and revised Brahmi/Gupta palaeography after new finds in central and western India. This manual reflects that consolidation: it places reading technique and material typology alongside language and script, so non-specialists can use inscriptions as historical evidence.

## Significance

A standard teaching and reference text, the book fixed classroom conventions for transcription, transliteration, and citation. It remains useful for quick identification of formulae, regnal-year dating, and plate/stone typologies before consulting editions and site reports.

## Editions & Sources

- Confirm exact edition based on imprint; add alternative scans if needed.

## Appendix: Curatorial TODOs

- Verify imprint (publisher, city, year) from title and verso pages.
- Extract table of contents and add to the tracker with page spans.
- List proper names (people/places) with brief identifiers for searchability.
- Capture one page image to assess scan quality (contrast, margins, diacritics).
- Note any missing or repeated pages; flag need for alternate scans.
- Record edition-specific features (preface, appendix, index) for citation.
- Prepare a 5–7 sentence abstract anchored in edition facts (no speculation).
- Identify two candidate excerpts (1–3 pages) suitable for teaching.
- Confirm PD status for all contributors/components (if anthology/translation).
- Add Archive identifier and direct file links to the tracker.
