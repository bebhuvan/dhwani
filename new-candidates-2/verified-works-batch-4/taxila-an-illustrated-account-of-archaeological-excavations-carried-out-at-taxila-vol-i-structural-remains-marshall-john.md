# Taxila: An Illustrated Account of Archaeological Excavations Carried Out at Taxila, Vol. I: Structural Remains

## Overview

Volume I presents the architectural record of a multi‑century urban and religious landscape on the Pothohar plateau: settlement mounds (Bhir Mound), planned Hellenistic‑influenced grids (Sirkap), Kushan‑period fortifications (Sirsukh), and Buddhist monastic/stupa complexes such as Dharmarājikā. Plans, sections, and phased descriptions tie building episodes to coinage and small finds.

## Edition Notes

- Reported year: 1951 (Volume I of a 3‑volume set; confirm imprint and plate lists)
- Coverage: Bhir Mound, Sirkap, Sirsukh, Dharmarājikā and associated monasteries; structural typologies; site‑by‑site phased accounts
- Apparatus: measured drawings, site plans, and photographic plates keyed to trench areas and features; concordance with coin and ceramic sequences
- Source: https://archive.org/details/dli.ministry.27295

## About the Author

Sir John Marshall (1876–1958) served as Director‑General of the Archaeological Survey of India (1902–1928). He initiated large‑scale excavations at Taxila and later oversaw work at Harappan sites; his Taxila trilogy became the baseline site report for Gandhāran archaeology.

## The Work

- Urban sites: describes street grids, fortifications, and house plans at Sirkap/Sirsukh and earlier Bhir Mound; notes reuse and rebuilding across periods.
- Buddhist complexes: records stupa bases, harmikā, circumambulatory paths, monastic courtyards, and votive shrines; relates construction phases to donor inscriptions and coin evidence.
- Method: integrates architectural phasing with stratigraphy and small finds; plates and plans permit independent cross‑checking of the phasing arguments.

## Historical Context

The excavations (1913–1934) reframed Gandhāra as a long‑lived contact zone linking Indo‑Greek, Indo‑Parthian, and Kushan material cultures with Buddhist monastic patronage. The report’s architecture‑first synthesis shaped subsequent regional histories and museum displays from Taxila to Peshawar.

## Significance

A foundational site monograph: the drawings and phased plans remain the starting point for research on Taxila’s urbanism and Buddhist architecture, even as later campaigns refine the ceramics and numismatics.

## Editions & Sources

- Confirm edition details (publisher, city, year); list plate counts; match plan numbers to plate captions for citation

## Rights

- India PD: No (author died 1958; India PD = 60y post‑death)
- US PD: No (publication year > 1929)

## Appendix: Curatorial TODOs

- Verify imprint (publisher, city, year) from title and verso pages.
- Extract table of contents and add to the tracker with page spans.
- List proper names (people/places) with brief identifiers for searchability.
- Capture one page image to assess scan quality (contrast, margins, diacritics).
- Note any missing or repeated pages; flag need for alternate scans.
- Record edition‑specific features (preface, appendix, index) for citation.
- Prepare a 5–7 sentence abstract anchored in edition facts (no speculation).
- Identify two candidate excerpts (1–3 pages) suitable for teaching.
- Confirm PD status for all contributors/components (if anthology/translation).
- Add Archive identifier and direct file links to the tracker.
