# Sakhi

## Overview

The collection builds lyric meditation around the vocative sakhī (confidante), a device that permits counsel, complaint, and argument within a single address. Nirālā’s flexible line and cadence allow quick turns from concrete image to ethical claim; the speaking voice tests perception against duty without didactic closure.

## Edition Notes

- Reported year: 1935 (confirm publisher and city from title/verso)
- Form: free‑verse lyric with recurrent second‑person address “sakhī”; sequence and sectioning to be verified from the scan

## About the Author

Suryakant Tripathi ‘Nirālā’ (1896–1961) is central to Hindi modernism (Chāyāvād). Across collections—Anāmikā, Parimāl, and others—he developed free‑verse prosody and an idiom of introspection and social critique; this book sits within his interwar experimentation.

## The Work

- Address and voice: sustained second‑person invocation structures argument and intimacy; oscillation between counsel and self‑reproach.
- Prosody: lineation breaks from syllabic regularity; internal rhyme and alliteration support shifts in tone.
- Image‑to‑thought: concrete sensuous detail lifts into abstract statement without prolonged exposition.

## Historical Context

Interwar Hindi poetry (c. 1918–1938) reworked romantic interiority and national time under the label Chāyāvād. Nirālā’s free verse and ethical lyric place him in a distinct register within that field alongside Prasād, Pant, and Mahādevī.
 
## Historical Context
 
Sakhi belongs to Chhayavād’s central phase, when lyric experiments reframed subjectivity as an ethical and aesthetic question for Hindi’s new readerships.
 
## The Work
 
- Address: the “sakhi” convenes intimacy and critique; the voice seeks a hearing that can respond.
- Sound: alliteration and internal rhyme remain, but line freedom often governs movement.
- Image and idea: concrete details lift into thought without discursive scaffolding.
 
## Significance
 
- Touchstone for lyric address in modern Hindi; demonstrates Nirala’s range within the movement.
 
## Editions & Sources
 
- Confirm imprint details and table of contents; extract poem list for indexing.
 
## Significance

Models a modern Hindi lyric built from address, cadence, and swift inference rather than metrical argument; often used to teach Chāyāvād technique beyond anthology pieces.
