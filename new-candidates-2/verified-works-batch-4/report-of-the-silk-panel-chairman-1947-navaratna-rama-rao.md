# Report of the Silk Panel (Chairman, 1947)

## Overview

Constituted in 1947, the Silk Panel reviewed India’s sericulture and silk manufacturing from mulberry cultivation through reeling, weaving, and trade. The Chairman’s report distills testimony and field data to identify supply‑chain bottlenecks and proposes technical standards, research capacity, and credit mechanisms to stabilize output and improve quality.

## Edition Notes

- Reported year: 1947 (confirm issuing department and city from title/verso)
- Contents (typical): summary of recommendations; sericulture and mulberry extension; reeling technology; weaving and market organization; labour and price policy; annexures with data tables and standards
- Source: https://archive.org/details/dli.ministry.21547

## About the Chair

Navaratna Rama Rao chaired the panel. His administrative background (to be verified from authority records) situates the document within late‑colonial and early post‑Independence industrial policy efforts.

## Duplicate Screening

- Run duplicate check against current catalog using title/author normalization.
- Distinguish new translations/editions from duplicates of the same edition.

## Source Integrity

- Capture the Archive identifier or stable catalog link.
- Prefer scans with complete, legible imprint pages.
- Add a direct file link (PDF/EPUB) if available for accessibility.
 
## Structure (to verify in scan)

- Executive summary and recommendations
- Sector overview with historical and international comparisons
- Technical chapters (cultivation, reeling, weaving), market structure, labour conditions
- Annexures: data tables, standards, selected transcripts
 
## Significance

Primary source for the historiography of industrial policy and agrarian extension: it records how the government conceptualized quality control, research stations, and finance for sericulture. It also anchors regional studies (e.g., Mysore and Bengal silk) with contemporaneous benchmarks.
 
## Editions & Sources
 
- Confirm imprint details (issuing department, city, year) and pagination; ensure all annexures are present.
 
## Reading Guide
 
- Extract 3–5 key recommendations and match each to the problem it addresses; assess feasibility and implied resources.

## Appendix: Curatorial TODOs

- Verify imprint (publisher, city, year) from title and verso pages.
- Extract table of contents and add to the tracker with page spans.
- List proper names (people/places) with brief identifiers for searchability.
- Capture one page image to assess scan quality (contrast, margins, diacritics).
- Note any missing or repeated pages; flag need for alternate scans.
- Record edition‑specific features (preface, appendix, index) for citation.
- Prepare a 5–7 sentence abstract anchored in edition facts (no speculation).
- Identify two candidate excerpts (1–3 pages) suitable for teaching.
- Confirm PD status for all contributors/components (if anthology/translation).
- Add Archive identifier and direct file links to the tracker.
