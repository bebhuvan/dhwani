# Pralay

## Overview

The play channels interwar anxieties—economic strain, political unrest, and changing social mores—into a plot that forces characters into difficult trade‑offs. Its rhetoric leans toward concentrated exchanges rather than lyrical monologues typical of earlier decades.

## Duplicate Screening

- Run duplicate check against current catalog using title/author normalization.
- Distinguish new translations/editions from duplicates of the same edition.

## Source Integrity

- Capture the Archive identifier or stable catalog link.
- Prefer scans with complete, legible imprint pages.
- Add a direct file link (PDF/EPUB) if available for accessibility.
 
## Historical Context
 
The early 1930s saw intensified debates about labour, nationalism, and social reform in Bengal. Theatre reflected these struggles, with companies mounting plays that engaged topical concerns while negotiating censorship and audience taste.
 
## The Work
 
- Theme: social and moral “deluge” overturning settled certainties.
- Structure: acts/scenes arranged around dilemmas that lack clean resolutions.
- Idiom: plain yet intense Bengali suited to ensemble playing.
 
## Significance
 
- A representative interwar “problem play” that anticipates post‑war progressive theatre while retaining craft learned from earlier commercial stages.
- Useful to students of modern Bengali drama as a bridge from late‑colonial to post‑colonial dramaturgy.
 
## Editions & Sources
 
- Confirm publisher, city, and year from the title/verso; note any series imprint.
- Record the Archive identifier and any additional scans for comparison.
 
## Reading Guide
 
- Chart how the play defines “pralay”: economic, ethical, or political; identify the scenes where the definition sharpens.

## Performance Notes

- Favor brisk pacing to reflect interwar urgency; avoid melodramatic elongation.
- Use sound cues sparingly to support tension without overwhelming dialogue.

## Notes for Curators

- Record any prefaces, censorship certificates, or production notes if included in the edition.

## Appendix: Curatorial TODOs

- Verify imprint (publisher, city, year) from title and verso pages.
- Extract table of contents and add to the tracker with page spans.
- List proper names (people/places) with brief identifiers for searchability.
- Capture one page image to assess scan quality (contrast, margins, diacritics).
- Note any missing or repeated pages; flag need for alternate scans.
- Record edition‑specific features (preface, appendix, index) for citation.
- Prepare a 5–7 sentence abstract anchored in edition facts (no speculation).
- Identify two candidate excerpts (1–3 pages) suitable for teaching.
- Confirm PD status for all contributors/components (if anthology/translation).
- Add Archive identifier and direct file links to the tracker.
