# Indian Architecture: Buddhist and Hindu Periods

## Overview

The volume charts two architectural lineages. The Buddhist section treats the stupa tradition and cave architecture (chaitya-grihas and viharas) at sites such as Sanchi, Bharhut, Karle, Ajanta, and Ellora, correlating form and chronology. The Hindu section analyzes structural temples by plan and superstructure—Nagara (north Indian), Dravida (south Indian), and Vesara—using measured drawings, elevations, and plate sequences.

## Edition Notes

- Reported year: 1959 (later reprint of a work first issued 1942; confirm imprint and plate list from scan)
- Organization: Part I Buddhist monuments; Part II Hindu temples; numerous site plans and plates
- Taxonomy used: Nagara/Dravida/Vesara; latitude for regional idioms (Orissan rekha, Chalukyan star-plans, Cola stone construction)
- Source: https://archive.org/details/dli.csl.8666

## About the Author

Percy Brown (1872–1955) worked in museums and art education in British India and Burma and published surveys of architecture and painting. His two-volume architecture set (this volume on Buddhist/Hindu monuments; a companion on Indo-Islamic forms) provided mid-century teaching frameworks used by museums and colleges.

## The Work

- Buddhist architecture: formal reading of stupa elements, railings, and gateways; rock-cut sequences at western Deccan sites; section drawings of chaitya vaults and vihara courts.
- Hindu temples: plan modules (square, cardinal offsets), sikhara profiles (latina, sekhari), dravida storeys with kapota cornices; regional case studies from Orissa, Deccan, and Tamil regions.
- Evidence base: plates and measured drawings keyed to ASI reports and inscriptional dates current to the 1940s–50s.

## Historical Context

The survey codifies a style-based account that shaped mid-century pedagogy and cataloguing. Later regional and patronage studies complicate its categories, but its terminology and plans remain a practical index to widely used stylistic labels.

## Significance

Useful for orientation to monuments and vocabulary (sikhara, mandapa, chaitya-griha, vihara, kapota). The illustrative apparatus supports quick cross-reference between plan-type, elevation, and site chronology.

## Editions & Sources

- Verify publisher, city, year, and plate count; reconcile figure captions with ASI site reports

## Reading Guide

- Map plan and elevation terms (sikhara, latina, kapota, sukanasa, mandapa) to one example per region
- Use the plate sequence to reconstruct the dating argument for a site; list the evidence adduced (inscriptions, motifs, construction)

## Comparative Pairings

- ASI reports for Sanchi, Karle, Ajanta, Ellora; Burgess/Fergusson for earlier survey; Michell's The Hindu Temple for later taxonomy

## Rights

- India PD: Yes (PD year: 2016)
- US PD: No (publication year > 1929)

## Appendix: Curatorial TODOs

- Verify imprint (publisher, city, year) from title and verso pages.
- Extract table of contents and add to the tracker with page spans.
- List proper names (people/places) with brief identifiers for searchability.
- Capture one page image to assess scan quality (contrast, margins, diacritics).
- Note any missing or repeated pages; flag need for alternate scans.
- Record edition-specific features (preface, appendix, index) for citation.
- Prepare a 5–7 sentence abstract anchored in edition facts (no speculation).
- Identify two candidate excerpts (1–3 pages) suitable for teaching.
- Confirm PD status for all contributors/components (if anthology/translation).
- Add Archive identifier and direct file links to the tracker.
