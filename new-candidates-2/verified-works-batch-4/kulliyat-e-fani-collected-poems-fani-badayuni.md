# Kulliyat-e-Fani (collected poems)

## Overview

The kulliyāt consolidates Fani’s ghazal‑centered oeuvre, preserving the classical apparatus—radīf and qāfiyā, matlaʿ opening, maqṭaʿ signature—while sustaining a diction attuned to ethical introspection and loss. The ordering and selection (to be confirmed from the imprint) document the poet’s trajectory across early and later registers.

## Edition Notes

- Reported year: to be verified from title/verso
- Form: ghazal predominance with nazm; internal arrangement (chronological/thematic) to be noted from the edition

## About the Author

Fani Badāyunī (1879–1961) wrote within the classical Urdu ghazal tradition while negotiating modern experience. His verse is marked by controlled idiom, rhetorical restraint, and a reflective temper; he is frequently programmed alongside Ghalib, Iqbal, and later Faiz in ghazal‑centered syllabi and mushāʿiras.

## The Work

- Technique: management of radīf/qāfiyā constraints without forcing diction; judicious takhallus usage in maqṭaʿ; balance of sanʿat (rhetorical figure) and mazmūn (topical argument).
- Themes: love’s ambiguities, time and ethical self‑scrutiny, public and private grief; occasional nazm widen topical scope beyond ghazal’s couplet logic.
- Reading practice: scan meters in selected ghazals; index radīf patterns; track semantic drift of key lemmas across the divān.

## Historical Context

Compiled in the milieu of early–mid 20th‑century North Indian Urdu publics—anthologies, periodicals, and mushāʿira performance—the kulliyāt format stabilized authorial canons for pedagogy and reprint circulation.

## Historical Context

The 20th‑century kulliyat format helped stabilize an author’s poetic identity for new publics and institutions (publishers, universities). Fani’s collected poems illustrate how ghazal tradition sustains continuity while absorbing new experience.

## The Work

- Form: canonical ghazal structure alongside nazms; verify the edition’s internal ordering.
- Themes: love and loss, ethical ambiguity, social observation; classical tropes reframed with modern tension.

## Significance

- A primary source for teaching the modern Urdu ghazal alongside Ghalib/Iqbal/Faiz.

## Editions & Sources

- Confirm publisher and year; ensure completeness (no missing pages) and legibility of diacritics.

## Significance

A compact access point to Fani’s corpus for classroom and research use: it supports metrical analysis, mazmūn‑tracking, and cross‑reference with contemporaries.

## Editions & Sources

- Verify publisher, city, and year; extract table of contents and index of opening hemistich (miṣra‑e ūlā) for searchability

## Reading Guide

- Select one ghazal; mark meter, radīf/qāfiyā, and takhallus use; paraphrase mazmūn development couplet by couplet

## Rights

- India PD: Yes (author died 1961; India PD year 2022 per CSV)
- US PD: Unknown (publication year of this compilation to be confirmed)

## Appendix: Curatorial TODOs

- Verify imprint (publisher, city, year) from title and verso pages.
- Extract table of contents and add to the tracker with page spans.
- List proper names (people/places) with brief identifiers for searchability.
- Capture one page image to assess scan quality (contrast, margins, diacritics).
- Note any missing or repeated pages; flag need for alternate scans.
- Record edition‑specific features (preface, appendix, index) for citation.
- Prepare a 5–7 sentence abstract anchored in edition facts (no speculation).
- Identify two candidate excerpts (1–3 pages) suitable for teaching.
- Confirm PD status for all contributors/components (if anthology/translation).
- Add Archive identifier and direct file links to the tracker.
