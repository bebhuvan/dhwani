# Chalantika: An Etymological Dictionary of Bengali

## Overview

Published 1937 by M.C. Sarkar & Sons, Calcutta. Single-volume etymological dictionary containing 40,000+ Bengali word entries tracing origins through Sanskrit, Prakrit, Pali, Persian, Arabic, Portuguese, English, and other source languages. Each entry provides: modern Bengali spelling, etymology with source language indicated, phonological transformations explained through linguistic principles, meanings, usage examples from Bengali literature spanning 10th-20th centuries. Distinguishes *tatsama* (Sanskrit words borrowed directly into Bengali with minimal change) from *tadbhava* (Sanskrit-derived words transformed through Prakrit/Apabhramsha phonological processes). Explains foreign loanwords: Persian/Arabic terms from Islamic period (1200-1757), Portuguese from colonial contact (1498-1961), English from British rule (1757-1947). Includes colloquial and vulgar terms typically excluded from prescriptive dictionaries, arguing complete linguistic documentation requires all registers. Compact format contrasts with Haricharan Bandopadhyaya's *Bangiya Shabdakosh* (5 volumes, 1932-1953)—Chalantika prioritizes accessibility over encyclopedic comprehensiveness. Continuously reprinted since 1937, remains standard etymological reference for Bengali linguistics, language teaching, literary scholarship.

## About Rajshekhar Basu

Basu (1880-1960), pen name *Parashuram*, achieved distinction in chemistry, lexicography, and literature. Born in Bardhaman, West Bengal. Graduated from Presidency College, Calcutta. Worked as chemist at Bengal Chemical & Pharmaceutical Works while pursuing literary activities. Published satirical short stories under *Parashuram* pen name, collected in *Gaddalika* (1924) and other volumes—sharp social satire examining Bengali middle-class pretensions, religious hypocrisy, colonial education's effects. Translated Sanskrit classics: *Mahabharata* (complete prose Bengali translation), *Ramayana*, *Srimad Bhagavatam*, *Hitopadesha*. These translations introduced classical epics to modern Bengali readers through accessible prose replacing older verse translations. Compiled *Chalantika* as single-author project over years of meticulous research. Also created *Anandabazar Patrika* Bengali spelling standardization guide influencing newspaper style across Bengal. Received Sahitya Akademi Fellowship (1956). Died 1960. Unique combination of scientific training (systematic methodology) and literary sensibility (usage sensitivity) produced lexicographic work balancing scholarly rigor with practical accessibility.

## Historical Context

Bengali lexicography began with missionary dictionaries—William Carey's *Dictionary of the Bengali Language* (1825), J.J. Mendies's *English and Bengali Dictionary* (1829)—serving missionary translation needs rather than documenting Bengali linguistic development. Haricharan Bandopadhyaya's *Bangiya Shabdakosh* (5 volumes, 1932-1953) represented first comprehensive Bengali-Bengali dictionary by Bengali scholar, encyclopedic in scope with extensive literary quotations. However, its multi-volume format limited accessibility. Basu conceived *Chalantika* as portable single-volume alternative providing essential etymological information without encyclopedic elaboration. Publication during Bengal Renaissance's late phase (1930s) reflected linguistic nationalism—establishing Bengali's historical depth, documenting indigenous linguistic development separate from Hindi/Hindustani promoted by northern Indian nationalists. Etymology demonstrated Bengali's direct descent from Sanskrit through Prakrit transformations, establishing literary prestige. Inclusion of Persian/Arabic loanwords documented Islamic period's linguistic influences, while Portuguese/English entries showed colonial contact's vocabulary expansion.

## Content and Method

**Entry Structure**: Each entry provides Bengali word in modern standard orthography, etymology in brackets indicating source language (Sanskrit, Prakrit, Pali, Persian, Arabic, Portuguese, English, Turkish, Hindi, Oriya, etc.), phonological explanation showing sound changes, current meanings ordered by frequency, literary usage examples.

**Phonological Explanation**: Systematic documentation of Sanskrit-to-Bengali sound changes following Prakrit/Apabhramsha phonological rules: consonant cluster simplification, vowel weakening, retroflex development. For example, Sanskrit *hasta* > Prakrit *hattha* > Bengali *hāt* (hand), with each transformation explained.

**Loanword Treatment**: Foreign words explained with original language indicated: Persian diplomatic/administrative terms (*daftar*, *khata*, *darbar*), Arabic religious vocabulary (*kitab*, *masjid*, *imam*), Portuguese trade/colonial terms (*almari*, *janala*, *balti*), English modern concepts (*school*, *train*, *ticket*). Shows linguistic layers reflecting historical contacts.

**Usage Examples**: Literary quotations from Charyapada (10th century Buddhist mystical poems, earliest Bengali texts), medieval poets (Chandidas, Krittibas), 18th-century court poets (Bharatchandra), 19th-century prose writers (Bankim Chandra), modern authors (Rabindranath Tagore, Sarat Chandra). Demonstrates words' literary currency across centuries.

**Prescriptive Elements**: While documenting actual usage including colloquialisms, occasionally indicates "corrupt form" for pronunciations Basu considered degraded, reflecting early 20th-century linguistic prescriptivism. Later editions softened these judgments.

**Coverage**: Includes technical terminology from traditional sciences (Ayurveda, astrology, music theory), religious vocabulary (Hindu, Muslim, Christian), kinship terms, flora/fauna names, legal/administrative language, mathematics, weights and measures.

## Significance

**Linguistic Scholarship**: Established systematic etymological methodology for Bengali lexicography. Demonstrated Bengali's historical development through regular phonological processes rather than random change. Influenced subsequent Bengali linguistic research and historical linguistics of Indo-Aryan languages.

**Educational Resource**: Used extensively in Bengali language teaching at secondary and university levels. Students studying medieval Bengali literature consult for understanding archaic vocabulary. Translators use for finding etymologically appropriate equivalents when rendering Sanskrit texts.

**Literary Analysis**: Literary scholars use for tracing semantic shifts over centuries, understanding word connotations in historical contexts, identifying foreign loanwords in texts. Essential for dating manuscripts based on vocabulary.

**Language Standardization**: Contributed to Bengali orthographic standardization by establishing preferred spellings. Basu's authority as lexicographer influenced Anandabazar Patrika and other newspapers' style guides.

**Cultural Documentation**: Inclusion of colloquial and vulgar terms preserved linguistic data typically excluded from "proper" dictionaries. Documented rural dialects, occupational jargon, caste-specific vocabulary providing sociolinguistic information.

**Comparative Philology**: Enabled comparison with other Indo-Aryan languages (Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Oriya) by showing shared Sanskrit origins and divergent phonological developments. Used by comparative linguists studying Indo-Aryan family.
