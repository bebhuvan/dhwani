# India Calling: The Memories of Cornelia Sorabji

## Overview

Published 1934 by Nisbet & Co., London. Chronicles Sorabji's life from 1866 birth in Nashik through becoming Bombay University's first female graduate, Oxford's first woman law student (1889-1892, though denied degree until post-WWI when Oxford began granting women degrees), and 1923 call to Bar at Lincoln's Inn age 55. Central focus: two-decade career as Lady Assistant to Court of Wards representing 600+ purdahnashin women—secluded women of orthodox families forbidden from communicating with unrelated men—in property disputes, inheritance cases, guardianship battles, protection from exploitation. Provides detailed ethnography of zenana (women's quarters) life, orthodox Hindu gender relations, colonial social hierarchies. Critiques missionary work, British colonialism, women's movements, and emerging Indian nationalism from unique position as Christian Parsi woman navigating elite British and Indian circles.

## About Cornelia Sorabji

Sorabji (November 15, 1866 – July 6, 1954) born in Nashik, Maharashtra. Father: Reverend Sorabji Kharshedji, Parsi Christian missionary. Mother: Francina Ford, established girls' schools in Pune. This reformist household provided education unusual for Indian women. Became Bombay University's first female graduate. With support from progressive Indians and British sympathizers—including Florence Nightingale, who contributed to Oxford scholarship—traveled to England 1889 to study law at Somerville College, Oxford. Despite brilliantly passing Bachelor of Civil Law examinations 1892, Oxford's refusal to grant women degrees meant she received BCL only 1920. From 1890s worked advocating for purdahnashin women, appointed Lady Assistant to Court of Wards in Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Assam—position created specifically to address these women's legal needs. After formal Bar admission 1923, practiced until 1929 retirement to England, where she wrote several books before 1954 death.

## Historical Context

Orthodox Hindu and Muslim elite families practiced purdah—strict female seclusion from unrelated men through physical segregation (zenanas) and veiling. System aimed to preserve family honor and female virtue but left women vulnerable to exploitation by male relatives, guardians, legal authorities controlling property and decisions. Purdahnashin women could not appear in court, consult male lawyers, or defend interests, creating conditions for systematic dispossession. British colonial administration introduced legal frameworks ostensibly protecting women's property rights and inheritance under Hindu and Muslim personal laws. However, reforms proved ineffective for purdahnashin women unable to access legal institutions designed around male participation. Sorabji's position as Lady Assistant addressed this gap, allowing women to consult female legal advocate within purdah constraints.

## Content and Perspective

**Legal Case Narratives**: Recounts dramatic cases—widows dispossessed by rapacious relatives, minors whose guardians embezzled estates, women forced into unwanted marriages. Interventions through Court of Wards produced victories but revealed legal system limitations and social prejudices constraining official advocacy.

**Zenana Ethnography**: Sorabji's access to women's quarters unavailable to male observers—British or Indian—produces detailed ethnographic documentation of zenana life, women's education, domestic arrangements, power dynamics within purdah. Descriptions illuminate aspects of elite Indian society hidden from historical record.

**Political Stance**: Unlike many Indian intellectuals, expressed skepticism toward nationalist movements, arguing Indians required extended British tutelage before independence. This controversial position reflects tensions between liberal reform and anti-colonial politics, illuminating period debates about appropriate pace and nature of political change.

**Spatial Analysis**: Memoir explores how spatial arrangements (zenanas, courts, public/private divisions) shaped women's experiences and possibilities. Sorabji's ability to traverse these spaces—entering zenanas professionally while appearing in courts—positioned her as mediator between segregated worlds.

**Missionary Critique**: Despite Christian background, critiques missionary paternalism, forced conversions, failure to understand Indian cultural contexts. Nuanced stance complicates narratives positioning Christianity as purely colonial imposition or enlightenment force.

## Significance

**Legal Advocacy Documentation**: Provides rare documented evidence of purdahnashin women's legal experiences, property struggles, court cases. Few other sources offer such detailed accounts of how elite Indian women navigated British colonial legal systems.

**Professional History**: As documented biography of India's first woman lawyer, provides essential source for studying women's entry into professions, barriers encountered, strategies for navigation, compromises required. Sorabji's 20-year wait between passing law exams and formal Bar admission exemplifies systematic discrimination even accomplished women faced.

**Colonial Feminism**: Exemplifies colonial feminism's complexity—genuine commitment to women's rights combined with acceptance of imperial rule as necessary for progress. Position challenges simplistic narratives positioning all feminism as either inherently colonial or straightforwardly liberatory.

**Ethnographic Value**: Detailed zenana observations by privileged female observer produce invaluable ethnographic data about elite Indian women's domestic lives, unavailable through male-centered historical sources.

**Historiographical Source**: Writing in volatile 1930s with rising nationalist agitation, Sorabji's recalled events shaped versions of respectable femininity and proper social change. Memoir thus functions as historical practice—constructing particular past to intervene in present debates.
