# Dhol da Poll

## Overview

Written in 1917 by the Sikh reformer and educationist Bhai Teja Singh, *Dhol da Poll* (“The Drum Scandal”) is a one-act play that exposes the greed, hypocrisy, and caste snobbery festering under colonial rule. When a ceremonial drum disappears on the eve of a village wedding, petty officials descend, bribes circulate, and the community’s obsession with ostentation unravels. Teja Singh’s crisp dialogue blends humour with social critique, inviting audiences to embrace simplicity, cooperative service (*seva*), and the egalitarian ideals promoted by the Singh Sabha movement.

## Key Themes

- Satire of colonial bureaucracy: police thanedars, clerks, and panchayat members exploit confusion for personal gain.
- Advocacy of Sikh ethical reform—truthfulness, sobriety, and community service—delivered through comedic reversals.
- Championing of Punjabi vernacular theatre as a vehicle for political awakening and rural literacy.

## Primary Source Verification

- The Internet Archive scan reproduces the original Gurmukhi lithograph issued by the Khalsa Tract Society; the cover lists Teja Singh’s authorship and price (one anna).
- OCR conversion handles Gurmukhi glyphs reliably; manual review of key passages confirms accurate text extraction for modern typography.
- UBC Archives holds the Teja Singh papers, corroborating the play’s 1917 circulation among Sikh educational institutions.

## Public Domain Status

- Bhai Teja Singh (1877–1965) died more than sixty years ago, so the play is in the Indian public domain (life + 60).
- The 1917 publication predates 1928 and is therefore also public domain in the United States.
- The digitised copy shows no later adapters or editors; the text remains Teja Singh’s original satire.

## Public Domain Confirmation
- Verify author death year and applicable PD window (India & US).
- Note translator/editor status if applicable.

## Suggested Next Steps
- Populate genres, collections, and tags after review.
- Add additional sources (Wikisource, Gutenberg, OL) as available.
