# Seepāra-e-Dil: Majmua-ye Mazameen, Jild 2

## Overview

*Seepāra-e-Dil* (“Pearls of the Heart”) gathers Khwaja Hasan Nizami’s short prose pieces written for Delhi’s reformist press during the 1910s. In this second volume he records vignettes from the city’s bazaars, shrines, and relief kitchens, urging readers toward acts of charity (*seva*), temperance, and inter-communal empathy. Essays describe Nizami’s campaigns to support war widows, his encounters with Sikh and Hindu philanthropists, and his observations on the moral dangers of ostentatious weddings. Rich with anecdotes, the collection doubles as an urban ethnography of Delhi recovering from plague, famine, and wartime anxiety.

## Key Themes

- Advocacy of social welfare through voluntary hospitals, orphanages, and communal kitchens funded by small donations.
- Defense of composite culture: Nizami celebrates shared festivals and highlights Delhi’s syncretic artistic heritage.
- Literary criticism and autobiography, including sketches of contemporary poets and reflections on the author’s own Khilafat activism.

## Primary Source Verification

- The Archive scan preserves the 1916 Matba’ Nizamiya edition with contents list, dedicatory note, and advertisements for Nizami’s other pamphlets.
- OCR capture is accurate for Urdu prose and Arabic quotations; random checks confirm fidelity.
- Rekhta’s bibliographic entry verifies publication data and positions this volume within the five-part *Seepāra-e-Dil* series.

## Public Domain Status

- Khwaja Hasan Nizami died in 1955; the collection is in the Indian public domain since 2016.
- Published before 1928, it is also in the public domain in the United States.
- The digitised file represents the author’s own compilation without later editorial changes.

## Public Domain Confirmation
- Verify author death year and applicable PD window (India & US).
- Note translator/editor status if applicable.

## Suggested Next Steps
- Populate genres, collections, and tags after review.
- Add additional sources (Wikisource, Gutenberg, OL) as available.
