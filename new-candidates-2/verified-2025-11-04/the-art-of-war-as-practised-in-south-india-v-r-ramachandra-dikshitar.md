# The Art of War as Practised in South India

## Overview

Historian V. R. Ramachandra Dikshitar authored this wide-ranging study to dispel the notion that the subcontinent lacked organised military science. Drawing on Sangam poems, Chola inscriptions, traveller accounts, and archaeological surveys, he reconstructs the strategies of southern polities from the Cheras to the Marathas. Chapters explore fort architecture, cavalry drill, elephant corps, metallurgy, and coastal defence, while appendices reproduce rare diagrams of weapons and battlefield formations. Dikshitar, a professor at the University of Madras, positioned the book as a corrective to Eurocentric military histories.

## Key Themes

- Emphasis on combined arms tactics—elephants, cavalry, and archers—and how they evolved with the arrival of gunpowder.
- Detailed attention to naval warfare on the Coromandel and Malabar coasts, including ship types and logistics of overseas expeditions.
- Integration of martial arts such as *kalaripayattu* into discussions of troop training and social organisation.

## Primary Source Verification

- The Internet Archive scan contains the full 1926 Oxford University Press edition with plates, charts, and footnotes intact.
- OCR accurately captures text and tabular data; cross-checked diagrams against the PDF for clarity.
- Modern discussions, such as the Frontline feature on southern martial traditions, acknowledge Dikshitar’s work as a foundational reference.

## Public Domain Status

- V. R. Ramachandra Dikshitar (1896–1953) died more than sixty years ago; the book is public domain in India as of 2014.
- Published in 1926, it is public domain in the United States.
- The digitised file reflects the original Oxford University Press printing without later revisions.

## Suggested Next Steps
- Populate genres, collections, and tags after review.
- Add additional sources (Wikisource, Gutenberg, OL) as available.
