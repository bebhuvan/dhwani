# Rithuvilasam (രിതുവിലാസം)

## Overview

*Rithuvilasam*—literally “Pageant of the Seasons”—is Vallathol’s poetic homage to Kerala’s landscape. Across six cantos the poet follows the cycle from *Vasantham* (spring) to *Shishiram* (winter), painting scenes of paddy transplantation, monsoon river swells, Onam festivities, and Kathakali rehearsals. Written in the aftermath of the 1921 Malabar uprising, the poem entwines sensual nature imagery with appeals for social harmony and national self-reliance. Vallathol champions the farmer and the fisherman as custodians of culture, urging elites to honour labour and protect the land.

## Key Themes

- Detailed sensory mapping of Kerala’s ecology—fragrant jackfruit blossoms, thunder over the Western Ghats, coastal breezes stirring temple lamps.
- Nationalist undertones: the poet calls on Malayalis to rejuvenate indigenous arts and institutions rather than imitate colonial habits.
- Fusion of classical metres with colloquial Malayalam, demonstrating Vallathol’s role in modernising poetic diction.
