# Hayat-e-Hafiz

## Overview

Composed a decade after *Hayat-e-Jaami*, this volume examines the life, poetry, and spiritual legacy of Hafiz of Shiraz. Jairajpuri surveys primary Persian chronicles, contextualises Hafiz’s relationship with the Muzaffarid court, and analyses representative ghazals to demonstrate the poet’s mastery of metaphor and music. A substantial section is devoted to Hafiz’s influence on the subcontinent—translations in Deccan courts, recitation in Delhi khanqahs, and the adoption of Hafiz’s verses in Urdu poetry and qawwali repertoires.

## Key Themes

- Differentiation between literal and mystical readings of Hafiz, supported by citations from classical commentators such as Sudi and Qazvini.
- Discussion of Sufi concepts (*ishq*, *tawakkul*, *khamr*) as they appear in the divan, making the text a primer on Persian symbolism.
- Consideration of Hafiz’s popularity in India, including anecdotes about Mughal emperors and Sikh savants quoting the divan.

## Primary Source Verification

- The Archive scan captures the 1921 Matba’ Mujtaba’i edition with Jairajpuri’s heartfelt dedication to Urdu readers and a chronological timeline of Hafiz’s life.
- OCR conversion handles Nastaliq diacritics and Arabic quotations reliably; cross-checked sample couplets against the printed page.
- Rekhta’s bibliographic record confirms printing details and indicates that this edition served as the source for later lithographs in Lucknow and Lahore.

## Public Domain Status

- Aslam Jairajpuri (1882–1955) died more than sixty years ago; the book entered the Indian public domain on 1 January 2016.
- The 1921 publication predates 1928, placing it in the public domain in the United States.
- The digitised copy reflects the author’s original Urdu text with no later editorial alterations.

## Suggested Next Steps
- Populate genres, collections, and tags after review.
- Add additional sources (Wikisource, Gutenberg, OL) as available.
