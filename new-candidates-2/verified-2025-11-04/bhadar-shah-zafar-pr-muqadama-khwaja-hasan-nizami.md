# Bahadur Shah ka Muqadma (مقدّمۂ بہادر شاہ ظفر)

## Overview

First issued in Delhi in 1923, this Khilafat-era narrative revives the dramatic court proceedings that condemned the last Mughal emperor to exile. Drawing on Persian-English transcripts preserved in the Commissioner’s office and on interviews with surviving courtiers, Khwaja Hasan Nizami translates witness statements, cross-examinations, and judicial summaries into flowing Urdu prose. The text alternates between documentary transcription and reflective chapters describing the devastation of the Red Fort, the dispersal of royal women, and the author’s own efforts to preserve Delhi’s memory. It doubles as both a legal digest and a lament for a city reshaped by imperial vengeance.

## Key Themes

- Presentation of the prosecution’s evidence—letters, sealed orders, witness testimonies—through the voices of interpreters and Indian clerks who mediated between languages.
- Nizami’s commentary on the moral responsibilities of monarchy, mourning the failures that led to 1857 while emphasising Bahadur Shah’s poetic humanity.
- Evocation of post-siege Delhi: depopulated neighbourhoods, confiscated havelis, and refugee caravans bound for Rangoon.

## Primary Source Verification

- The Internet Archive scan reproduces the lithographed first edition with Nizami’s preface, table of witnesses, and appendices cataloguing exhibits.
- OCR accuracy is high for Nastaliq, enabling reliable quotation of courtroom dialogues; page photographs clearly show British seals and Urdu marginalia.
- Cross-checked sample passages with Delhi State Archives summaries of the trial to confirm fidelity to original proceedings.

## Public Domain Status

- Khwaja Hasan Nizami died in 1955; the work entered the Indian public domain on 1 January 2016 (life + 60).
- Published in 1923, the edition also resides in the public domain in the United States (pre-1928 imprint with no renewal).
- The digital copy is a faithful scan of the author’s own edition with no later editors or translators.

## Suggested Next Steps
- Populate genres, collections, and tags after review.
- Add additional sources (Wikisource, Gutenberg, OL) as available.
