# Hayaat E Jaami .. Urdu حیات مولانا جامی ْْ اردو

## Overview

Written when Aslam Jairajpuri was teaching Arabic and Persian in Aligarh, *Hayat-e-Jaami* introduces Urdu readers to the fifteenth-century Persian scholar, poet, and Naqshbandi saint ‘Abd al-Rahman Jami. Jairajpuri narrates Jami’s education in Herat, his relationship with guru Sa’d al-Din Kashghari, and his contributions to genres ranging from ghazal to philosophical treatise. The book contextualises Jami’s major works—*Baharestan*, *Yusuf u Zulaikha*, *Nafahat al-Uns*—and explains how they travelled through Mughal India, shaping curricula at madrasas and Sufi khanqahs.

## Key Themes

- Exploration of Jami’s synthesis of Ibn ‘Arabi’s metaphysics with Naqshbandi spiritual discipline.
- Discussions of poetic aesthetics, including metre, symbolism, and Jami’s engagement with classical Persian predecessors.
- Attention to Indo-Persian reception history, especially translations and citations found in Delhi and Lucknow manuscripts.

## Primary Source Verification

- The Internet Archive scan reproduces the 1911 Matba’ Mujtaba’i edition with Jairajpuri’s foreword, chronological appendices, and bibliography of Jami’s Arabic and Persian works.
- OCR output for Nastaliq script is clean; sampled passages retain diacritics and footnotes, easing modern typography.
- Rekhta catalogue corroborates publication details and highlights later reprints, confirming this scan matches the first edition.

## Public Domain Status

- Aslam Jairajpuri died in 1955, so the biography entered the Indian public domain on 1 January 2016.
- Published in 1911, the work is also in the public domain in the United States.
- The digitised copy reflects the author’s own Urdu text without subsequent editors or translators.

## Suggested Next Steps
- Populate genres, collections, and tags after review.
- Add additional sources (Wikisource, Gutenberg, OL) as available.
