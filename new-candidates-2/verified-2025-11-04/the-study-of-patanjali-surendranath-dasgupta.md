# The Study of Patanjali

## Overview

Delivered at Columbia University in 1920, Dasgupta’s lectures distil the essentials of Patanjali’s Yogasutra for readers unfamiliar with Sanskrit sources. He outlines the dualistic metaphysics of Samkhya-Yoga, analyses Patanjali’s psychology of afflictions (*klesha*), and examines the eightfold path (*ashtanga*) alongside discussions of meditation, miracles, and liberation. The book also contrasts Yogic epistemology with Western philosophical debates on mind and matter, foreshadowing themes that Dasgupta would later develop in his five-volume *History of Indian Philosophy*.

## Key Themes

- Detailed exposition of Patanjali’s categories—*citta*, *vritti*, *samskara*—with references to classical commentaries by Vyasa and Vachaspati Misra.
- Comparative reflections that bridge ancient yoga practices with modern psychology and ethics.
- Emphasis on method: Dasgupta explains textual criticism, terminology, and historical context for students entering Sanskrit studies.
