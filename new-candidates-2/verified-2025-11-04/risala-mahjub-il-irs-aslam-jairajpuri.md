# Risala Mahjub al-Irs

## Overview

Aslam Jairajpuri authored *Risala Mahjub al-Irs* to simplify the complex arithmetic of Islamic inheritance for Urdu-speaking students and legal practitioners. Beginning with Qur’anic injunctions, he sets out the hierarchy of heirs, defines *asabah* (agnatic relations), and explains how blocked shares (*mahjub*) alter distributions. The treatise includes worked examples of disputed cases, tables for converting fractional shares into rupees and annas, and guidance on reconciling Hanafi rulings with customary practice in North India.

## Key Themes

- Instruction in legal mathematics, teaching readers to reconcile Quranic fractions using least common multiples and “awl” adjustments.
- Clarification of women’s inheritance rights and refutation of customs that deprive daughters and widows.
- Integration of hadith and early juristic opinions with modern administrative requirements for probate courts.

## Primary Source Verification

- The Internet Archive scan contains the complete Matba’ Mujtaba’i printing with typographic diagrams and sample estate calculations.
- OCR output is crisp for Urdu numerals and Arabic terms, facilitating reuse in modern typesetting.
- Rekhta’s bibliographic entry confirms the 1923 publication year and notes Jairajpuri’s role as sole author and instructor at Aligarh.

## Public Domain Status

- Aslam Jairajpuri died in 1955; the work is public domain in India since 2016.
- Published in 1923, it is likewise in the public domain in the United States.
- The digitised volume represents the author’s original instructional text without later revision.

## Public Domain Confirmation
- Verify author death year and applicable PD window (India & US).
- Note translator/editor status if applicable.

## Suggested Next Steps
- Populate genres, collections, and tags after review.
- Add additional sources (Wikisource, Gutenberg, OL) as available.
