# Charcha-shatak

## Overview

Premi structures *Charcha-shatak* (“One Hundred Conversations”) as dialogues between inquisitive readers and a patient teacher. Each short essay addresses questions that Jain youth posed in reading rooms across Bombay and Surat: How should a layperson reconcile business with *ahimsa*? Can women assume leadership in congregations? What role should libraries play in combating superstition? Premi interlaces scriptural references with anecdotes from contemporary reformers, producing a handbook that is at once doctrinally grounded and socially progressive.

## Key Themes

- Clarification of Jain philosophical terms—*dravya*, *guna*, *paryaya*—through practical illustrations.
- Appeals for women’s education and the abolition of dowry practices within Jain communities.
- Promotion of inter-sectarian harmony, urging Shvetambar and Digambar groups to collaborate on publishing initiatives.

## Historical Significance

The volume captures the spirit of Jain modernism during the late colonial period, when print culture, public libraries, and reform conferences reshaped religious life. Premi’s approachable prose helped standardise modern Hindi usage among Jain readers and inspired similar catechetical works in Gujarati and Marathi. For Dhwani, *Charcha-shatak* complements canonical scriptures with the lived debates of twentieth-century laypeople.
