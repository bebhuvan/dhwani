# Na-gufta: Qaisar-e-Germany ka Musalman Hona, Jild 5

## Overview

Serialised in Nizami’s Delhi-based press during the early years of World War I, *Na-gufta* spins an imaginative yarn in which Kaiser Wilhelm II embraces Islam after witnessing Ottoman bravery. Volume 5 follows the fictional Kaiser as he tours Istanbul, Mecca, and Delhi under Nizami’s guidance, praising Muslim unity and condemning British duplicity. The narrative—equal parts travelogue, sermon, and pamphlet—was designed to keep morale high among Indian Muslims, presenting the Ottoman struggle as divinely sanctioned and closely aligned with Khilafat objectives.

## Key Themes

- Political fantasy mobilising Muslim solidarity; the Kaiser’s conversion serves as allegory for Europe recognising Islam’s moral superiority.
- Calls for ethical reform—sobriety, charity, discipline—so that Indian Muslims may merit divine assistance against colonial oppression.
- Interludes featuring conversations with Ottoman, Arab, and Indian characters, showcasing Nizami’s talent for weaving contemporary geopolitics into entertaining prose.

## Primary Source Verification

- The Archive scan preserves the lithographed pamphlet with chapter headings, reader correspondence, and advertisements that tie this instalment to the broader *Na-gufta* series.
- OCR quality is strong; sampled passages confirmed accurate rendering of Ottoman names and Urdu rhetoric.
- Rekhta’s entry corroborates publication details and situates the volume within Nizami’s Khilafat-era oeuvre.

## Public Domain Status

- Khwaja Hasan Nizami died in 1955; the text entered the Indian public domain on 1 January 2016.
- Printed in 1914, it also falls into the United States public domain (publication before 1928).
- The digitised copy reflects the author’s own pamphlet without later editorial intervention.

## Public Domain Confirmation
- Verify author death year and applicable PD window (India & US).
- Note translator/editor status if applicable.

## Suggested Next Steps
