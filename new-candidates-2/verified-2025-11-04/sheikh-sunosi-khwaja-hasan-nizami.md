# Sheikh Sunosi

## Overview

In *Sheikh Sunosi*, Khwaja Hasan Nizami recounts the life of Muhammad al-Sanusi, founder of the Libyan Sanusiya order, and the order’s struggle against Italian occupation. Combining translated dispatches, traveller reports, and his own meditations, Nizami presents al-Sanusi as a model of ascetic leadership and disciplined organisation. He urges Indian Muslims to emulate the Sanusiya’s fortitude, linking North African resistance to the wider Khilafat cause and to debates on pan-Islamic unity in Delhi.

## Key Themes

- Biography of the Sanusiya order’s rise, describing its networks of zawiyas, caravan logistics, and moral training.
- Emphasis on anti-colonial solidarity: Nizami draws parallels between Libyan and Indian experiences under European rule.
- Practical lessons on community organisation, fund-raising, and maintaining morale during protracted resistance.

## Primary Source Verification

- The Archive scan preserves the Matba’ Nizamiya printing with Nizami’s preface dated 1915 and a bibliography of European sources he consulted.
- OCR captures the flowing Urdu prose accurately; spot checks confirmed names and Arabic phrases.
- Context cross-checked with the English-language summary of the Sanusi order to verify historical details about the Libyan resistance.

## Public Domain Status

- Khwaja Hasan Nizami (1873–1955) passed away more than sixty years ago; his text is public domain in India (life + 60).
- The 1915 publication predates 1928, so it is also in the public domain in the United States.
- The digitised copy reflects the original pamphlet with no later editorial revisions.

## Public Domain Confirmation
- Verify author death year and applicable PD window (India & US).
- Note translator/editor status if applicable.

## Suggested Next Steps
- Populate genres, collections, and tags after review.
- Add additional sources (Wikisource, Gutenberg, OL) as available.
