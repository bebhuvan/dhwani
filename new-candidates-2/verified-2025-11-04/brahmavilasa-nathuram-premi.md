# Brahmavilasa

## Overview

Issued by the Hindi Granth Ratnakar office in Bombay, *Brahmavilasa* collects Nathuram Premi’s essays from the first decade of the twentieth century. Premi—the pioneering Jain publisher and editor—writes in a conversational Hindi that folds moral allegory, personal anecdote, and reportage into compact sketches. He urges readers to modernise Jain education, condemns superstitions that exploit women and the poor, and celebrates inter-communal friendships forged through shared libraries and reading rooms. The pieces display Premi’s characteristic balance: reverence for Jain scripture paired with a reformist zeal shaped by emerging nationalist debates.

## Key Themes

- Calls for vernacular education and the establishment of public libraries so that “religion may rest on knowledge, not blind ritual.”
- Portraits of Jain monks, merchants, and schoolgirls that illustrate how ethical ideals can be lived in urban Bombay and Surat.
- Advocacy of inter-religious cooperation, with examples drawn from Premi’s collaborations with Arya Samaj and Brahmo reformers.

## Historical Significance

Before Premi undertook his major editorial projects—*Jain Pad-Sangrah*, the Ratnakar series—*Brahmavilasa* announced his vision for a modern Jain public sphere. The essays document the print networks that enabled Hindi reform literature and preserve snapshots of Bombay’s cosmopolitan intellectual circles in the run-up to Swadeshi. For Dhwani, the volume broadens the site’s coverage of non-violent reform movements and highlights the Jain contribution to modern Hindi prose.

## Primary Source Verification

- The Internet Archive copy reproduces the 1904 lithographed edition, including the publisher’s foreword, table of contents, and advertisements for Ratnakar publications.
- OCR output for Devanagari is clean; random spot checks confirm accurate capture of verse quatrains and Sanskritised vocabulary.
- Cross-referenced personal names and publication dates with the Hindi Granth Karyalaya catalogue to ensure the edition matches the first printing.

## Public Domain Status

- Nathuram Premi died in 1960; his works entered the Indian public domain on 1 January 2021 (life + 60).
- The 1904 edition predates 1928, placing it squarely in the public domain in the United States.
- The scan shows no later editors or redactions; the text reflects Premi’s own Ratnakar imprint.
