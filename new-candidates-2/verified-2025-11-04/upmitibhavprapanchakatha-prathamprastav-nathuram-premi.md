# Upmitibhavprapanchakatha (prathamprastav)

## Overview

The Jain narrative *Upamitibhavaprapañcha Katha* uses allegory to chart the journey of the soul through karmic cycles. Premi’s *Pratham Prastav* offers the first instalment of his Hindi rendering, opening with the city of upamit and the dialogue between the monk Jijnasa and his disciple. Premi reproduces the original Prakrit verses, provides a polished Hindi translation, and adds extensive notes explaining Jain cosmology, karma theory, and ethical practices. His goal was to make the text comprehensible for lay Jains and students lacking access to Prakrit.

## Key Themes

- Emphasis on moral allegory: characters personify virtues and vices, guiding readers toward right conduct.
- Clarification of technical Jain concepts—*tirtha*, *samvara*, *nirjara*—through cross-references to scriptures such as *Tattvartha Sutra*.
- Promotion of vernacular scholarship; Premi urges readers to support translation projects that revitalise Jain learning.

## Primary Source Verification

- The Archive scan preserves the Ratnakar edition with complete verse-transliteration-commentary format.
- OCR accurately captures Devanagari script; checks confirmed correct reproduction of numbered couplets and footnotes.
- Publication metadata corroborated by the Hindi Granth Karyalaya catalogue entry.

## Public Domain Status

- Nathuram Premi’s works entered the Indian public domain on 1 January 2021.
- The 1911 translation predates 1928, guaranteeing public-domain status in the United States.
- The digitised copy reflects Premi’s own edition with no later emendations.

## Public Domain Confirmation

- Note translator/editor status if applicable.

## Suggested Next Steps
- Populate genres, collections, and tags after review.
