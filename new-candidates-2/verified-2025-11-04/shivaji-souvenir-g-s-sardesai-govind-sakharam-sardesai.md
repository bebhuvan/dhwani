# Shivaji Souvenir (G. S. Sardesai)

## Overview

Prepared under the direction of renowned Maratha historian Govind Sakharam Sardesai, the *Shivaji Souvenir* marked the 1927 tricentenary of Shivaji Maharaj’s birth. The volume gathers scholarly essays, curated primary documents, fold-out maps of fort networks, genealogical charts, and rare photographs of coronation regalia. Sardesai contextualises Shivaji’s statecraft within Deccan geopolitics, the Bhakti movement, and maritime trade, aiming to inspire pride while grounding celebration in archival research. Contributions from contemporary scholars, poets, and administrators make the souvenir a snapshot of interwar Maharashtrian intellectual life.

## Key Themes

- Analytical essays on military organisation, naval ventures, and administrative reforms of the Maratha kingdom.
- Reproductions of Persian farmans, Marathi letters, and European travel accounts that trace Shivaji’s diplomacy.
- Visual culture: portraits of forts, weapons, and pageantry staged during the 1927 public festivals in Poona and Bombay.

## Primary Source Verification

- The Archive scan includes all supplementary material—maps, photographs, plates—and the publishers’ note issued by the Shivaji Festival Committee.
- OCR handles English text reliably; tables and legends are clear in the downloadable PDF.
- Sardesai’s authorship and the souvenir’s historical importance are corroborated by contemporary retrospectives such as *The Tribune* feature remembering his contributions to Maratha historiography.

## Public Domain Status

- G. S. Sardesai (1865–1959) died over sixty years ago; the volume is public domain in India as of 1 January 2020.
- Published in 1927, it is also in the public domain in the United States.
- The digitised copy reflects the original souvenir prepared by the Shivaji Tri-centenary Mandal without later alterations.
