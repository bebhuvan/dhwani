# Digambarjaingrantkarta Or Unke Granth

## Overview

Compiled in 1911, *Digambar Jain Granthakāra aur Unke Granth* is Nathuram Premi’s reference guide to the writers who shaped Digambara Jain literature. Organised chronologically and by monastic lineage, the book supplies short biographies, lists of extant manuscripts, publication histories, and notes on subject matter. Premi cross-references libraries in Bombay, Jaipur, and Bikaner, providing shelf marks so that researchers could consult primary sources. The catalogue closes with thematic indexes and a glossary of manuscript abbreviations, effectively serving as an early twentieth-century union catalogue for Jain studies.

## Key Features

- Biographical sketches of more than 150 Digambara monks, lay scholars, and poetesses, highlighting their regional origins.
- Detailed bibliographies indicating whether works survive in palm-leaf form, lithograph, or newly printed editions.
- Introductory essay urging Jain communities to preserve manuscripts and collaborate on critical editions—an agenda that later informed Premi’s Ratnakar publishing program.

## Historical Significance

Premi’s guide predates institutional catalogues by the Archeological Survey of India and offered scholars their first consolidated map of Digambara literature. It directly inspired projects such as the Jain Vishva Bharati bibliography and continues to be cited by editors preparing critical editions. Including it on Dhwani foregrounds the bibliographic infrastructure that underpins modern Jain scholarship.

## Public Domain Status

- Nathuram Premi died in 1960; his works entered the Indian public domain on 1 January 2021.
- Published in 1911, the volume is unquestionably in the public domain in the United States.
