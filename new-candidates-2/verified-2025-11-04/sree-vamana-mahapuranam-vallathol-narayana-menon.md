# Sree Vamana mahapuranam

## Overview

*Sree Vamana Mahapuranam* revisits the celebrated legend of Vishnu’s dwarf incarnation visiting King Mahabali. Vallathol moulds the narrative into resonant Malayalam verse, highlighting themes of self-sacrifice, egalitarianism, and the reclaiming of native traditions. The work accompanied the cultural revival of Onam festivities spearheaded by Vallathol, linking mythic time with contemporary struggles for social reform and linguistic pride.

## Key Themes

- Reinterpretation of Mahabali as an ethical ruler whose generosity becomes an inspiration for modern Kerala.
- Celebration of performing arts—Vallamkali, Pulikali, Kathakali—that keep the story alive during Onam.
- Emphasis on humility and restraint: Vamana’s three steps become metaphors for moral discipline in public life.

## Primary Source Verification

- The Archive scan reflects the Kerala Sahitya Parishad edition with Vallathol’s preface and canto divisions.
- OCR handles Malayalam text cleanly; spot checks ensure correct rendering of verse lines and punctuation.
- Context about Vallathol’s cultural leadership confirmed via The Hindu’s profile article.

## Public Domain Status

- Vallathol Narayana Menon (1878–1958) is public domain in India from 2019 onward.
- The 1924 publication predates the US 1928 cut-off, placing it in the public domain internationally.
