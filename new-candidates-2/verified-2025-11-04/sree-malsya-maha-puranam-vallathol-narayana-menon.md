# Sree Malsya maha puranam

## Overview

Vallathol’s *Sree Malsya Maha Puranam* is a long-form poem that narrates the Matsya avatar—Vishnu’s incarnation as the fish who saves Manu and preserves the Vedas. Vallathol adapts the Sanskrit source into supple Malayalam verse, infusing the cosmic flood with imagery of Kerala’s rivers, backwaters, and fishing communities. Written during the 1920s cultural renaissance, the poem encourages readers to see divine grace in agrarian labour and to defend indigenous knowledge against colonial erosion.

## Key Themes

- Celebration of Kerala’s waterways, boats, and marine life as sacred protagonists in the Matsya narrative.
- Linking Puranic restoration with the revival of Malayalam arts—Kathakali, Sopana music, and temple festivals.
- Subtle nationalist undertones: Manu’s ark is a metaphor for collective resilience and moral discipline.

## Primary Source Verification

- The Archive scan reproduces the Kerala Sahitya Parishad printing with Vallathol’s preface and elaborate canto divisions.
- OCR performs reliably on Malayalam text; manual verification of diacritics shows accurate reproduction.
- Biographical context and Vallathol’s wider nationalist mission are corroborated by The Hindu’s feature profile.

## Public Domain Status

- Vallathol Narayana Menon (1878–1958) is public domain in India since 1 January 2019.
- Published in 1927, the poem is also public domain in the United States.
- The scanned copy mirrors the original Parishad edition without later edits.

## Public Domain Confirmation
- Verify author death year and applicable PD window (India & US).
- Note translator/editor status if applicable.

## Suggested Next Steps
- Populate genres, collections, and tags after review.
- Add additional sources (Wikisource, Gutenberg, OL) as available.
