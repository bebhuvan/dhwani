# Sun-babies: Studies in the Child-life of India

## Overview

India’s first woman barrister, Cornelia Sorabji travelled extensively as a legal adviser for secluded women (*purdahnashin*) and as a reform campaigner. In *Sun-babies* she documents the children she met—Rajput princesses learning English, tribal boys mastering archery, fisherfolk toddlers playing on the Konkan coast, and street performers in Calcutta. Sorabji juxtaposes delight in folk games, lullabies, and seasonal rituals with critiques of child marriage, lack of schooling, and public health challenges. The book’s rich illustrations by British artist Warwick Goble complement Sorabji’s empathetic prose, making it accessible to Western readers while amplifying Indian voices.

## Key Themes

- Ethnographic attention to regional customs—Onam flower carpets, Holi celebrations, camel races, kite-flying—framed through children’s experiences.
- Advocacy for education and legal protection; Sorabji draws on her courtroom work to explain reforms needed for orphans and child widows.
- Cross-cultural storytelling aimed at dispelling colonial stereotypes by presenting Indian childhood as diverse, creative, and resilient.

## Primary Source Verification

- The Internet Archive scan includes the Hodder & Stoughton first edition with Warwick Goble’s colour plates and Sorabji’s preface dated 1904.
- OCR renders English text accurately; image plates are clear for reuse in educational materials.
- Biographical context on Sorabji’s reform work is corroborated by contemporary profiles such as the India Today article marking her birth anniversary.
