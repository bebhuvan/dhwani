# The Journal of the Bihar and Orissa Research Society, Vol. VII (1921)

## Overview

Founded in 1915, the Bihar and Orissa Research Society brought together historians, archaeologists, linguists, and civil servants to document the eastern provinces’ past. Volume VII (1921) features Jadunath Sarkar’s editorial guidance and includes papers on Mauryan and Gupta inscriptions, reports on Nalanda excavations, catalogues of Mithila palm-leaf manuscripts, surveys of tribal folklore, and translations of Persian farmans relating to Patna. The journal exemplifies early 20th-century collaborative scholarship that blended colonial administrative resources with Indian intellectual leadership.

## Key Themes

- Interdisciplinary research: archaeology, numismatics, ethnology, and philology coexist within the same volume.
- Publication of primary sources, such as newly discovered inscriptions and land grants, many still cited by contemporary scholars.
- Emphasis on regional historiography, encouraging local museums and archives to collaborate with the Society.

## Primary Source Verification

- The Internet Archive scan captures the Patna-printed issue with the Society’s proceedings, membership list, and tables of contents.
- OCR reproduces English text accurately; lithographed plates and fold-outs are legible in the PDF.
- Recent news coverage about efforts to revive the Society underscores its historic importance and provides contextual validation.

## Public Domain Status

- The journal issue was published in 1921 and contains contributions from authors who died well before 1964; the volume is public domain in India and the United States.
- The digitised copy reflects the original Patna publication without later redactions.

## Public Domain Confirmation
- Verify author death year and applicable PD window (India & US).
- Note translator/editor status if applicable.

## Suggested Next Steps
- Populate genres, collections, and tags after review.
- Add additional sources (Wikisource, Gutenberg, OL) as available.
