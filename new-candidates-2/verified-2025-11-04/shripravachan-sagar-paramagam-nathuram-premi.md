# Shripravachan Sagar - Paramagam

## Overview

Issued alongside Premi’s main translation of *Pravachansara*, *Shripravachan Sagar* functions as an “anubandh”—a supplementary ocean of explanations. It expands on the sutras with thematic essays on Jain cosmology, karmic theory, vow-taking, and meditation practice. Premi surveys Digambara and Shvetambara commentaries, summarises achar (conduct) codes for monks and laity, and compiles a 120-page glossary of Sanskrit-Prakrit terms. The volume also supplies a topical index and concordance linking *Pravachansara* passages to other canonical texts, allowing readers to navigate the wider Jain philosophical corpus.

## Key Features

- Comparative tables aligning Kundakunda’s doctrines with later Digambara acharyas like Samantabhadra and Pujyapada.
- Practical guidance for lay practitioners, including schedules for *samayika*, dietetics, and ethical commerce.
- Rich bibliographic notes that trace manuscript lineages and modern print efforts, underscoring the urgency of preservation.

## Primary Source Verification

- The Archive scan preserves the extensive appendices, indices, and Ratnakar press advertisements tied to Premi’s Jain reform projects.
- OCR renders Devanagari text accurately; checks confirmed clarity of dense glossary entries and numerical tables.
- Catalogue data from Hindi Granth Karyalaya verifies the title’s status as the official supplementary volume to Premi’s *Pravachansar* edition.
