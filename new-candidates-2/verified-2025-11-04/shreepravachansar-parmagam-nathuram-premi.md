# Shreepravachansar Parmagam

## Overview

Acharya Kundakunda’s *Pravachansara*—a foundational Digambara Jain treatise—was largely the preserve of Sanskrit-literate monks until reformers like Nathuram Premi produced vernacular editions. Premi’s 1908 *Shri Pravachansar Parmagam* prints the original Sanskrit couplets alongside Romanised transliteration, word-for-word glosses, and extensive Hindi commentary. He elucidates concepts such as *jiva*, *ajiva*, *lesya*, and *nirjara*, supplementing the text with parallels from other Jain scriptures and practical guidance for lay ethics. The volume was part of Premi’s broader mission to democratise access to Jain philosophy through the Hindi Granth Ratnakar press.

## Key Features

- Tripartite layout: Sanskrit sutra, literal rendering, and explanatory prose arranged for easy study circles.
- Appendices covering meters, doctrinal charts, and a glossary of technical terms bridging Prakrit, Sanskrit, and Hindi usage.
- Emphasis on ethical application—Premi relates Kundakunda’s metaphysics to issues such as business integrity, diet, and non-violence in colonial India.

## Primary Source Verification

- The Archive scan preserves the Ratnakar edition with publisher’s note, errata slip, and advertisements for allied Jain classics.
- OCR faithfully reproduces Devanagari text; manual checks confirm accurate rendering of ligatures and numerals in doctrinal tables.
- Publication data and editorial apparatus corroborated through the Hindi Granth Karyalaya catalogue entry.

## Public Domain Status

- Nathuram Premi (1881–1960) died more than sixty years ago; the edition is public domain in India (life + 60).
- Printed in 1908, it is also public domain in the United States.
- The digitised copy reflects Premi’s own translation and notes without later revisions.

## Public Domain Confirmation
- Verify author death year and applicable PD window (India & US).
- Note translator/editor status if applicable.

## Suggested Next Steps
