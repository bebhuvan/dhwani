# Islam Ka Anjam

## Overview

Delivered to packed audiences in Delhi and later printed as a pamphlet in 1912, *Islam ka Anjam* (“The Fate of Islam”) exhorts readers to reform their personal and communal conduct. Khwaja Hasan Nizami laments complacency, factionalism, and materialism among South Asian Muslims, arguing that these vices invite political subjugation. He interweaves Qur’anic verses, anecdotes of the Prophet’s companions, and examples from contemporary Delhi to show how sincerity, charity, and unity can avert decline. The sermon reflects the ferment that would soon coalesce into the Khilafat and Non-Cooperation movements.

## Key Themes

- Moral self-examination: Nizami urges listeners to replace ostentatious religiosity with humble service to neighbours irrespective of creed.
- Critique of social ills such as usury, dowry inflation, and neglect of education, linking them to economic dependency on colonial rulers.
- Call for inter-communal solidarity—particularly with Hindus—to resist imperial divide-and-rule tactics.

## Primary Source Verification

- The Internet Archive scan reproduces the original lithographed pamphlet complete with marginal notes indicating where the sermon was delivered.
- OCR quality is high for the Nastaliq text; sampled quotations align with the printed source.
- Rekhta corroborates publication information and lists subsequent reprints circulated by the Khilafat committees.

## Public Domain Status

- Khwaja Hasan Nizami (1873–1955) died over sixty years ago; the text is in the Indian public domain (life + 60).
- The 1912 imprint predates the 1928 cut-off, making it public domain in the United States.
- The digitised copy shows no editorial alterations; it is the author’s own sermon in pamphlet form.

## Suggested Next Steps
- Populate genres, collections, and tags after review.
- Add additional sources (Wikisource, Gutenberg, OL) as available.
