# Economics of British India

## Overview

Issued in 1913 as an enlarged third edition, *Economics of British India* distils Jadunath Sarkar’s Calcutta University lectures on agrarian contracts, industrial organisation, and fiscal policy. Sarkar moves from the ecological variety of the subcontinent—rice deltas, dry-crop tracts, plantation belts—to tenancy law, irrigation finance, and the village credit system. Later chapters analyse the fate of indigenous hand industries under Lancashire competition, railway-driven market integration, and the structure of foreign and indigenous capital in trade. Throughout, Sarkar annotates official statistics with field observations collected during his travels for the Bengal Civil Service examinations, aiming to furnish Indian candidates with analytic tools equal to British textbooks.

## Key Themes

- Comparative appraisal of Ryotwari, Zamindari, and Mahalwari revenue systems and their socio-economic effects.
- Case studies of cotton, jute, tea, and coal industries tracking labour mobilisation and foreign investment.
- Discussion of currency, budgetary policy, and the drain of wealth debate in the wake of the 1905–08 Swadeshi movement.

## Historical Significance

Sarkar’s manual stood alongside Romesh Chunder Dutt’s writings as a nationalist-inflected critique of colonial economics that still worked within the statistical idiom of the Raj. It became a staple reader for students preparing for the ICS and for political workers articulating economic demands before the Montagu–Chelmsford reforms. The book also demonstrates how a premier Mughal historian engaged contemporary policy questions, bridging archival erudition with current affairs. For historians today it offers a window into early twentieth-century Indian economic thought before the formalisation of development economics.

## Public Domain Status

Jadunath Sarkar (1870–1958) died more than sixty years ago, so his works entered the Indian public domain on 1 January 2019. This Calcutta edition, published in 1913 by M. C. Sarkar & Sons, was issued well before 1928 and is therefore in the public domain in the United States. The Internet Archive copy reproduces the Allahabad University library holding without later editorial interventions.
