# Ghalib ka Roz-Nama: Ghadar Dihli ke Afsane, Hissa 7

## Overview

In this instalment of his celebrated *Ghadar Dihli ke Afsane* series, Khwaja Hasan Nizami reconstructs Mirza Ghalib’s diary covering the tumultuous months of 1857. Drawing on manuscripts preserved by Ghalib’s disciples and on oral testimony from Delhi families, Nizami arranges entries that describe the scarcity of food, the shelling of the city, and the poet’s sardonic reflections on imperial justice. Each entry is followed by explanatory notes that situate names, neighbourhoods, and customs for twentieth-century readers discovering Ghalib as both poet and eyewitness.

## Key Themes

- Juxtaposition of Ghalib’s biting humour with scenes of displacement and mourning in post-siege Delhi.
- Documentation of everyday survival strategies—water rationing, neighbourhood patrols, appeals to British officers.
- Commentary on the emotional toll of exile as Ghalib’s friends are executed, imprisoned, or sent to Rangoon.

## Historical Significance

The *Ghadar Dihli ke Afsane* volumes revived 1857 memories in vernacular prose and inspired later historians such as Zahir Dehlvi and Aslam Parvez. Volume 7 is especially prized because it preserves passages of Ghalib’s prose otherwise unavailable, offering a counterpoint to the poet’s famous letters. For Dhwani, the book illustrates how Sufi chroniclers curated literary heritage to heal a city traumatized by rebellion and retribution.

## Primary Source Verification

- The Internet Archive scan includes Nizami’s introduction, the reconstructed daily entries, and appendices cataloguing witnesses consulted.
- OCR capture of Nastaliq script is serviceable, though diacritics should be checked manually for accuracy.
