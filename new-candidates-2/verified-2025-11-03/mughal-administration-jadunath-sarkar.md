# Mughal Administration

## Overview

Delivered in 1920 as the Patna University Readership Lectures, *Mughal Administration* distils Sarkar’s archival research on the inner workings of the seventeenth-century empire. Each lecture concentrates on a pillar of statecraft—land revenue, military organisation, judicial practice, intelligence, and the emperor’s household establishment. Sarkar mines the *Ain-i-Akbari*, *Dastur-al-Amal*, and Dutch factory letters to explain how mansabdars were graded, how jagirs were assigned and audited, and how the kotwal, qazi, and muhtasib balanced urban order with imperial edicts. The lectures emphasize the dynamism of the system, noting reforms under Akbar, Shah Jahan, and Aurangzeb as responses to frontier pressures.

## Key Themes

- Detailed exposition of the mansabdari hierarchy and its links to cash salaries, jagir assignments, and troop quotas.
- Analysis of revenue assessment (zabt) and collection, including the roles of qanungos, amils, and village officials.
- Discussion of policing, espionage, and postal networks as instruments of imperial surveillance and communication.

## Historical Significance

Sarkar’s lectures offered one of the earliest systematic English-language treatments of Mughal governance grounded in primary sources. They shaped generations of students and administrators, providing a counterweight to colonial stereotypes of oriental despotism by demonstrating bureaucratic sophistication. Modern historians still cite the work for its clear synthesis of Persian administrative manuals and for its insights into the fiscal-military nexus that sustained the empire.

## Public Domain Status

Jadunath Sarkar (1870–1958) died more than sixty years ago; the book is in the Indian public domain as of 1 January 2019. The original 1920 Patna University publication predates 1928, placing it in the public domain in the United States. The Internet Archive scan reproduces the Calcutta edition without later editorial additions.
