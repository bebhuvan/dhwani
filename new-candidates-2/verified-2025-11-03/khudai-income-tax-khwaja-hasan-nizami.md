# Khudai Income Tax

## Overview

In *Khudai Income Tax* (“God’s Income Tax”), Nizami deploys humour to advocate systematic charity. Framing God as the benevolent finance minister of creation, he calculates a spiritual levy of ten percent on income to be spent on feeding the poor, supporting widows, funding schools, and sustaining the Khilafat agitation. The pamphlet mimics government tax manuals, complete with sample ledgers and “penalties” for defaulters—namely, spiritual stagnation and communal decline. Nizami’s blend of wit and moral exhortation made the booklet a popular fundraising tool for relief campaigns in Delhi.

## Key Themes

- Recasting *zakat* and voluntary charity as disciplined budgeting rather than sporadic almsgiving.
- Linking personal generosity to national regeneration and inter-communal harmony.
- Using satire to critique colonial fiscal burdens while promoting an indigenous ethic of redistribution.

## Historical Significance

The pamphlet illuminates how Khilafat-era leaders mobilised religious rhetoric to sustain social welfare projects and political activism. It also showcases the creative prose strategies Nizami employed to communicate complex ideas to shopkeepers, artisans, and women’s study circles. Scholars of South Asian philanthropy cite the work as evidence of early twentieth-century experiments in Islamic economics.

## Primary Source Verification

- The Internet Archive scan preserves the original typographic playfulness, including mock tax tables and Nizami’s autograph note.
- OCR accuracy is high; numerical tables may require manual confirmation before reuse.

## Public Domain Status

Khwaja Hasan Nizami (1873–1955) died more than sixty years ago, placing this text in the Indian public domain. Published in 1924, it is likewise public domain in the United States. The digitised copy reflects the first edition without later amendments.
