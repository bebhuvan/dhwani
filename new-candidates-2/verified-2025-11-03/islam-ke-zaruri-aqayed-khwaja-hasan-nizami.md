# Islam ke Zaruri ‘Aqa’id

## Overview

Designed as a primer for madrasa beginners and family study groups, *Islam ke Zaruri ‘Aqa’id* lays out fundamental doctrines—belief in God, angels, prophets, revealed books, resurrection, and destiny—followed by concise guidance on ablution, prayer, fasting, and charity. Nizami frames each lesson as a question-answer dialogue, making it easy for teachers to prompt memorisation and discussion. The prose blends doctrinal instruction with anecdotes that demonstrate how faith should shape social conduct and civic responsibility in colonial India.

## Key Themes

- Simplified creed statements accompanied by textual proof from Qur’an and Hadith.
- Integration of Sufi ethics, urging readers to cultivate sincerity, gratitude, and service to the poor as signs of true belief.
- Encouragement of communal solidarity by emphasising shared rituals and collective supplication.

## Historical Significance

The booklet reflects Khilafat-era educational reform, when Urdu-speaking Muslims sought accessible, orthodox yet inclusive materials for youth. Nizami’s approach bridged reformist Deobandi emphasis on creed with Chishti devotional warmth. The text continued to circulate in South Asian diaspora communities, illustrating the enduring demand for concise theological manuals.

## Primary Source Verification

- The digitised edition includes structured lessons, review questions, and devotional appendices.
- OCR quality is high; minimal editing is needed to repurpose passages in teaching materials.

## Public Domain Status

Khwaja Hasan Nizami (1873–1955) died over sixty years ago; his works are in the Indian public domain. Issued in 1924, this booklet is also public domain in the United States. The scanned copy matches the original Delhi printing without later redactions.
