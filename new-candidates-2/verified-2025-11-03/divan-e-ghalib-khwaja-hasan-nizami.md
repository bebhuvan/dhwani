# Diwan-e-Ghalib (Khwaja Hasan Nizami Edition)

## Overview

Seeking to make Mirza Ghalib’s dense metaphors accessible to emerging Urdu readers, Khwaja Hasan Nizami produced this popular edition around 1920. Each ghazal appears in its classical form followed by *asar* (simple paraphrases) and short glosses that decode Persianised imagery, Qur’anic allusions, and Delhi idioms. Nizami organises the corpus thematically—love, mysticism, satire—and supplements the poems with anecdotes from disciples who had sat in Ghalib’s mehfils, thereby situating the poet within Delhi’s post-1857 cultural landscape.

## Key Features

- Explanatory footnotes clarifying obscure compound words and metaphysical conceits.
- Short biographies of Ghalib’s patrons and companions, linking individual ghazals to historical events.
- An introductory essay on prosody and pronunciation to assist students of *rekhta* in scanning classical metres.

## Historical Significance

The edition reflects the early twentieth-century revival of Ghalib spearheaded by Delhi’s Sufi networks and literary societies. By translating high Persianised diction into conversational Urdu, Nizami broadened the poet’s readership beyond aristocratic circles, paving the way for authoritative commentaries by Hafiz Mahmood Shirani and Abid Ali Khan. For Dhwani, the volume exemplifies how colonial-era editors mediated between tradition and modern readerships while preserving oral recollections of the poet’s milieu.

## Primary Source Verification

- The Internet Archive scan includes the editor’s foreword, detailed table of metres, and the complete ghazal corpus with annotations.
- OCR accuracy for Nastaliq is moderate; manual correction is recommended for scholarly reuse.

## Public Domain Status

Mirza Ghalib (1797–1869) and editor Khwaja Hasan Nizami (1873–1955) both died more than sixty years ago, placing this annotated edition in the Indian public domain. Published before 1928, it is likewise in the public domain in the United States. The scanned copy bears no later editorial interventions.
