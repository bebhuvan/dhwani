# Islami Rasool

## Overview

*Islami Rasool* forms part of Nizami’s devotional pamphlet series aimed at urban and rural audiences who lacked access to classical Arabic biographies. Written in clear Hindustani-tinged Urdu, the narrative follows Muhammad’s life from birth and the first revelation to the Constitution of Medina and the Farewell Sermon. Nizami emphasises universal values—justice, compassion for neighbours of all faiths, the dignity of labour—and concludes each chapter with practical advice for readers seeking to embody prophetic conduct in colonial India.

## Key Themes

- Stress on *akhlaq* (ethical character) as the foundation of community reform.
- Examples of interfaith camaraderie drawn from Medina to bolster Hindu–Muslim unity in contemporary politics.
- Summaries of key battles and treaties, highlighting the Prophet’s preference for negotiation and amnesty.

## Historical Significance

Nizami’s popular sirah literature reached audiences far beyond madrasa graduates, influencing Khilafat-era sermonising and Urdu didactic writing. By connecting prophetic virtues to modern nationalist struggles, he encouraged Muslims to view social service and non-violence as Islamic duties. The booklet also reveals the pedagogical strategies of Delhi Sufi leaders, who blended storytelling with concise theological exposition.
