# Jain Pad-Sangrah, Volume 1

## Overview

Premi’s *Jain Pad-Sangrah* project set out to preserve the devotional songs (*pads*) of early modern Jain poets. Volume 1 focuses on Kavivar Dolatrām (18th century), assembling 125 compositions sourced from manuscripts in Jaipur, Bikaner, and Surat. Each pad appears in Devanagari with variants noted in footnotes, followed by explanations of metaphors, metres, and doctrinal nuances. The introductory essay situates Dolatrām within the Sthanakvasi reform movement and analyses his distinctive blending of Jain ethics with Bhakti imagery.

## Key Features

- Critical apparatus comparing manuscript readings and annotating regional lexicon.
- Short biographies of gurus and disciples mentioned in the poems, aiding contextual interpretation.
- Appendices listing ragas and talas, making the collection useful for kirtan performers.

## Historical Significance

Premi’s anthology marked a turning point in Jain literary scholarship, moving from hagiographic retellings to philological editing. By publishing the pads with meticulous notes, he enabled scholars and lay devotees to reconnect with a neglected corpus and inspired subsequent editions of Jain Bhakti literature. The series also contributed to the Hindi renaissance by demonstrating the richness of Jain contributions to North Indian devotional traditions.

## Primary Source Verification

- The scanned volume includes Premi’s 70-page introduction, annotated pads, and indices correlating first lines with manuscript shelf marks.
- OCR represents Devanagari accurately, though complex ligatures should be double-checked when citing.

## Public Domain Status

Nathuram Premi (1881–1960) died more than sixty years ago; his writings entered the Indian public domain on 1 January 2021. The 1912 publication predates 1928, so it is also public domain in the United States. The Internet Archive copy mirrors the original Bombay edition issued by Hindi Granth Ratnakar.
