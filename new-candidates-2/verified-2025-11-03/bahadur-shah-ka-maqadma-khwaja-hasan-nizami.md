# Bahadur Shah Ka Maqadma

## Overview

In *Bahadur Shah Ka Maqadma* (“The Trial of Bahadur Shah”), the Delhi-based Sufi author Khwaja Hasan Nizami narrates the proceedings that followed the 1857 uprising when the British tried the last Mughal emperor within the Red Fort. Drawing on Persian and English transcripts preserved in the Commissioner’s office and on testimonies from surviving courtiers, Nizami translates depositions, cross-examinations, and verdicts into accessible Urdu prose. The book alternates between documentary extracts and the author’s reflective chapters that describe the emotional devastation of the emperor’s household and the transformation of Delhi after the siege.

## Key Themes

- Presentation of colonial legal procedure, including the framing of charges around “rebellion” and “murder,” through the voices of interpreters and Indian witnesses.
- Nizami’s parallel commentary on the moral responsibilities of the emperor, the loyalty of Delhi’s citizens, and the cruelty of exile.
- A concluding appeal for preserving Mughal monuments and for recognising Bahadur Shah Zafar as a poet-emperor wronged by imperial justice.

## Historical Significance

The work helped Urdu readers in the early twentieth century reclaim the memory of 1857 as a story of martyrdom rather than treason. It became a cornerstone for subsequent nationalist histories, influencing writers such as Abul Kalam Azad and Abdul Halim Sharar. For scholars today, Nizami’s volume is valuable for the vernacular framing of colonial legal records and for the author’s interviews with courtiers who had witnessed the trial, many of whom left no other written trace.

## Primary Source Verification

- The Internet Archive scan reproduces the 1923 Delhi printing with the author’s preface, index of witnesses, and facsimile of Zafar’s final petition.
- OCR captures Nastaliq reasonably well, though manual proofreading is recommended before reuse.

## Public Domain Status

Khwaja Hasan Nizami (1873–1955) died over sixty years ago, placing his works in the Indian public domain from 1 January 2016. The 1923 publication predates 1928, so the book is also in the public domain in the United States. No later editors amended the text in the scanned edition.
