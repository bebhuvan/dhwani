# India In World Politics

## Overview

Composed while Taraknath Das taught in the United States, *India in World Politics* surveys the reconfigured geopolitics of the 1920s. Das analyses British imperial interests, the Washington Naval Conference, Soviet policy in Asia, and the growth of Japanese and Chinese nationalisms. He contends that India’s fate is central to the balance of power: a free India would anchor Asian cooperation and undermine imperial militarism, whereas continued subjugation would fuel global instability. The book blends statistical data—trade figures, troop deployments—with rhetorical appeals grounded in Woodrow Wilson’s doctrine of self-determination.

## Key Themes

- Critique of economic exploitation via tariff policies, resource extraction, and sterling reserves held in London.
- Advocacy of pan-Asian solidarity, particularly alliances with revolutionary China and the colonised Muslim world.
- Arguments for constitutional reforms in India alongside strategies for diasporic activism in North America.

## Historical Significance

Das was among the first Indian revolutionaries to frame independence as a question of international security rather than solely moral justice. His work circulated among expatriate networks, influencing lobbying efforts in the United States and discussions within the League Against Imperialism. The book documents an early fusion of academic international-relations analysis with anti-colonial strategy, making it a vital resource for scholars of global nationalism.
