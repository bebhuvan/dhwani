# Namazon ka Bayan

## Overview

Among Nizami’s earliest publications, *Namazon ka Bayan* (“Exposition of Prayers”) guides Urdu-speaking readers through the theology and practicalities of the five daily prayers. The booklet explains ritual purity, orientation, call to prayer, and the sequence of standing, bowing, and prostration. It pairs juristic rulings from Hanafi manuals with Sufi reflections on concentrating the heart, illustrating how intention transforms routine into devotion. Marginal notes supply Arabic transliterations and vernacular translations of key supplications.

## Key Themes

- Step-by-step instructions for *wudu*, *ghusl*, and special prayers such as Jumat, Eid, and funeral rites.
- Emphasis on humility, congregation, and punctuality as pillars of communal cohesion.
- Practical advice for travellers, women, and workers balancing worship with daily responsibilities.

## Historical Significance

This manual demonstrates how Chishti teachers like Nizami responded to the need for accessible religious education in rapidly urbanising Delhi. By demystifying ritual law without sacrificing spiritual depth, the booklet supported grassroots reform movements and informed countless prayer classes, especially among newly literate women.

## Primary Source Verification

- The digitised copy includes the original lithographed layout, Arabic text, and explanatory footnotes.
- OCR quality is strong for Urdu script, enabling reuse in instructional materials.
