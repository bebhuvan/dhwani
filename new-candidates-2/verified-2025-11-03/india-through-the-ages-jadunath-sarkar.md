# India Through the Ages

## Overview

Adapted from Sarkar’s 1927 Patna University lectures, *India Through the Ages* condenses three millennia of history into accessible essays for students and general readers. Each chapter examines a formative epoch—the Vedic age, the Mauryan synthesis, classical temple cultures, the Delhi Sultanate, the Mughal zenith, and the rise of the British Raj—while emphasising how administrative structures, literary languages, and religious ideas interacted. Sarkar juxtaposes archaeological discoveries with Persian chronicles and colonial records, inviting readers to see Indian civilisation as a series of layered inheritances rather than abrupt ruptures.

## Key Themes

- Comparative portraits of imperial governance, from Ashoka’s dhamma to Akbar’s sulh-i-kul and the decentralised structures of British paramountcy.
- Discussions of intellectual life that connect Sanskrit, Persian, and vernacular literatures to broader social change.
- Reflections on nationalism and the responsibilities facing independent India, based on lectures delivered during the late colonial constitutional debates.

## Historical Significance

The volume popularised Sarkar’s archival expertise for a wider audience, becoming a favourite preparatory text for civil-service candidates and provincial colleges. It offered an alternative to Eurocentric textbooks by centring indigenous voices and by recognising Muslim and regional polities as integral to the Indian story. For Dhwani, the book illustrates how early twentieth-century Indian historians balanced scholarly rigour with the pedagogical task of nation-building.

## Public Domain Status

Jadunath Sarkar (1870–1958) died more than sixty years ago; the book is in the Indian public domain as of 1 January 2019. Issued in 1928 by M. C. Sarkar & Sons, it was published before 1929 and therefore also resides in the public domain in the United States. The Internet Archive scan reproduces the original Calcutta edition without later editorial revisions.
