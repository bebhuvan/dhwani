# Safar-Nama

## Overview

Nizami’s *Safar-Nama* records excursions undertaken between 1919 and 1922, including pilgrimages to Ajmer and Bareilly, fund-raising tours for Khilafat relief, and visits to syncretic shrines. Each chapter juxtaposes logistical detail—train timetables, lodging houses, roadside meals—with Sufi meditations on hospitality and remembrance. The author interviews fakirs, zamindars, Congress activists, and railway porters, preserving their dialects and folklore. His humour shines when he satirises bureaucratic hurdles or recounts misadventures with luggage, all while emphasising the spiritual lessons gleaned on the road.

## Key Themes

- Celebration of India’s plural sacred geography, highlighting shared rituals at Chishti, Nath, and Bhakti sites.
- Commentary on social reform, particularly the need for women’s education and hygiene in caravanserais.
- Observations on railway modernity and its impact on mobility, solidarity, and economic exchange.

## Historical Significance

The travelogue offers a rare Muslim reformist perspective on postwar northern India, complementing contemporaneous accounts by Gandhi and Mahadevi Varma. It documents organisational networks that sustained Khilafat and Non-Cooperation campaigns, while also capturing disappearing qawwali traditions. Literary historians value the text for its conversational prose and for showing how Sufi authors embraced modern transport and print culture.

## Public Domain Status

Khwaja Hasan Nizami (1873–1955) died more than sixty years ago, so his works are in the Indian public domain. Published in 1923, this travelogue is also public domain in the United States. The digitised copy reflects the first Delhi edition without later modifications.
