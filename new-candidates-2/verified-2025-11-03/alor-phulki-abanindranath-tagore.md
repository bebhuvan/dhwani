# Alor Phulki

## Overview

*Alor Phulki* ("Sparks of Light") is Abanindranath Tagore’s Bengali adaptation of Edmond Rostand’s avian drama *Chantecler*. Issued by Visva-Bharati in 1919, the volume presents Rostand’s allegory of a barnyard rooster whose crowing brings dawn as a series of lyrical dialogues and prose scenes accessible to Bengali readers while retaining the moral meditation on truth versus illusion.

Tagore situates the tale within a multilingual frame: English paratext acknowledges the French source and Florence Yates Hann’s retelling, while the Bengali narrative voices white hens, night birds, doves, and the proud rooster as they debate whether the light of the world depends on human devotion or the sun’s own fidelity. The blend of rhythmic prose and theatrical stage cues maps Rostand’s symbolist drama to the sensibilities of the Bengal School, inviting young readers into conversations about humility, service, and the pursuit of inner illumination.

For Dhwani, *Alor Phulki* documents the early twentieth-century cross-pollination between European modernist theatre and Bengali children’s literature. It showcases Abanindranath’s capacity to reinterpret world literature within the Swadeshi cultural project, sitting alongside his retellings of Persian and Rajput legends to demonstrate how translation and adaptation anchored a nascent national aesthetic.

## Primary Source Verification

- The Digital Library of India scan (Visva-Bharati, 1919) preserves the illustrated cover, English title page referencing Rostand’s *Chantecler*, and the full 104-page dramatic text in Bengali script.
- Pagination includes Abanindranath’s bibliographical note acknowledging earlier serial publication and subsequent revisions, aligning with the 1947 Visva-Bharati reprint described in contemporary catalogues.
- OCR confirmation via PDF download (`bub_man_dd1ef9fc550ab6adc767c5282b852781_text.pdf`) shows legible English paratext and Bengali body text, suitable for transcription or linguistic analysis.

## Public Domain Confirmation

- Abanindranath Tagore died on 7 December 1951; his works entered the Indian public domain on 1 January 2012 (life + 60).
- This edition was published in 1919, placing it in the United States public domain (publication prior to 1 January 1928).
- No later editors or translators are credited in the 1919 printing; the adaptation and paratext are entirely Abanindranath’s and rely on Rostand’s public-domain original.
