# Islami Tauhid

## Overview

In *Islami Tauhid*, Nizami explains the creed of divine oneness (*tauhid*) in plain Urdu, addressing questions posed by his disciples and by audiences at Delhi’s khanqahs. The booklet outlines three dimensions of monotheism—unity of lordship, worship, and attributes—and refutes folk practices that he argues dilute the centrality of God. Drawing on Qur’anic verses, Hadith, and examples from the lives of Sufi saints, Nizami encourages believers to combine correct belief with compassion, service, and remembrance of God in daily routines.

## Key Themes

- Clarification of theological terminology such as *shirk*, *tawakkul*, and *ihsan* with relatable parables.
- Emphasis on ethical comportment—honesty, humility, and social justice—as evidence of genuine belief.
- Advice for inter-communal harmony, stressing that recognising one God should inspire respect for all creation.

## Historical Significance

The tract reflects efforts by early twentieth-century Sufi leaders to counter both colonial polemics and sectarian disputes within South Asian Islam. By making doctrinal instruction accessible to artisans and merchants, Nizami helped democratise theological knowledge and reinforced reformist currents aligned with the Khilafat movement’s moral appeals.

## Primary Source Verification

- The digitised copy includes the author’s foreword, topical chapters, and a glossary tailored for students.
- OCR of the Nastaliq text is clear, enabling excerpting for study circles or translation projects.

## Public Domain Status

Khwaja Hasan Nizami (1873–1955) died more than sixty years ago; his works are in the Indian public domain. This 1924 publication predates 1928 and is therefore also in the public domain in the United States. The scan reflects the original edition without later emendations.
