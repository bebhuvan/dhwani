# Pathe Bipathe

## Overview

Serialised in *Sabuj Patra* and gathered into book form by Visva-Bharati in 1918, *Pathe Bipathe* (“Along the Way, Against the Way”) records Abanindranath Tagore’s excursions along the Hooghly, Padma, and smaller distributaries. The author narrates his voyages to child companions, encouraging them to observe colours on the river, the rhythm of boatmen’s songs, and the quiet industry of ferries and ghats. Each sketch slides effortlessly from firsthand description to fairy-tale digression, showing how Bengali rural life could be rendered through the sensory vocabulary of the Bengal School of painting. The later English adaptation *Ways and Wanderings* (1919) would popularise these vignettes with anglophone readers, but the original Bengali retains the conversational intimacy of Tagore’s family storytelling.

## Key Themes

- Observations of seasonal river ecology, from monsoon swells to winter sandbanks, tied to reflections on livelihood and craft.
- Dialogues about humility, curiosity, and compassion as essential virtues for artists travelling through unfamiliar villages.
- Allusions to folk songs, Vaishnava lore, and Mughal pictorial motifs that braid together multiple cultural lineages.

## Historical Significance

*Pathe Bipathe* extends the Swadeshi aesthetic into travel writing, demonstrating how attentive seeing and listening could nurture civic responsibility. The sketches informed Abanindranath’s pedagogy at Kala Bhavana, where students practised drawing from barges and documenting itinerant performers. Scholars today read the book alongside his paintings to trace how narrative prose, illustration, and national sentiment intertwined in the decades before independence.

## Public Domain Status

Abanindranath Tagore (1871–1951) died more than sixty years ago; his works entered the Indian public domain on 1 January 2012. This 1918 Bengali edition also predates the US copyright cut-off of 1928 and is therefore in the public domain in the United States. The Internet Archive scan reproduces a Digital Library of India copy without later editorial additions.
