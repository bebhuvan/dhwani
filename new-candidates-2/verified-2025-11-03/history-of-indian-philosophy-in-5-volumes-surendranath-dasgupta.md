# A History of Indian Philosophy, Volume I

## Overview

Cambridge University Press issued Volume I of Dasgupta’s *History of Indian Philosophy* in 1922 as part of a projected five-volume series. In nearly 600 pages, Dasgupta covers the Vedic hymns, the Upanishads, early Buddhist and Jaina thought, and the rise of classical systems such as Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya-Vaisheshika, and Mimamsa. Each chapter summarises primary Sanskrit and Pali texts, discusses key debates (e.g., the nature of perception, causality, liberation), and compares Indian arguments with contemporary Western philosophy, underscoring the sophistication of indigenous logical traditions.

## Key Themes

- Emphasis on textual sources: the author quotes original Sanskrit passages and provides transliterations and cross-references to critical editions.
- Chronological mapping of schools, highlighting inter-school dialogues and doctrinal borrowings.
- Analytical sections on epistemology and metaphysics that situate Indian systems within global philosophical discourse.

## Historical Significance

Dasgupta’s project was the first comprehensive survey of Indian philosophy written by an Indian scholar for an international audience. It countered colonial narratives that dismissed Indian thought as mystical by demonstrating rigorous argumentation across traditions. Volume I remains a foundational reference for students of South Asian philosophy and has influenced generations of scholars including B. K. Matilal and Wilhelm Halbfass.

## Primary Source Verification

- The Internet Archive scan reproduces the 1922 Cambridge edition with the publisher’s preface, extensive bibliography, and index.
- OCR accuracy is high for the English text; Sanskrit diacritics appear correctly in the PDF though manual checking is advised before reuse.

## Public Domain Status

Surendranath Dasgupta (1887–1952) died more than sixty years ago, placing his works in the Indian public domain as of 1 January 2013. This 1922 publication predates 1928 and therefore also lies in the public domain in the United States. The scanned volume shows no later editorial alterations.
