# Krishna Beeti Krishna Jeevan

## Overview

In *Krishna Beeti Krishna Jeevan*, Nizami narrates the childhood exploits, pastoral romances, and philosophical teachings of Krishna for Urdu readers. He adapts episodes from the *Bhagavata Purana* and Surdas’s poetry, presenting Krishna as an exemplar of divine love whose attributes resonate with Sufi ideas of *ishq-e-haqiqi* (true love). Nizami highlights moments of compassion—lifting Govardhan, protecting Draupadi—to illustrate virtues that Muslims and Hindus alike should emulate in everyday life.

## Key Themes

- Parallelism between Bhakti devotion and Sufi mysticism, especially in the symbolism of the flute and the beloved.
- Calls for communal harmony grounded in shared reverence for saintly figures and moral storytelling.
- Emphasis on social justice, as Krishna defends peasants against oppressive taxation and champions the dignity of women.

## Historical Significance

The book exemplifies how early twentieth-century Sufi writers engaged Hindu narratives to foster interreligious understanding. Circulating during the fraught years after the Khilafat movement, Nizami’s retelling reinforced the idea that spiritual kinship could counter communal tensions. It influenced subsequent Urdu renditions of Hindu epics by authors such as Pandit Brij Narayan Chakbast.

## Primary Source Verification

- The digitised copy contains Nizami’s preface, twenty-eight chapters, and concluding prayers for harmony.
- OCR faithfully captures the Nastaliq script, facilitating quotation for research or translation.
