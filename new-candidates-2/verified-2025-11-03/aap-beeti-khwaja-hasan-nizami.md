# Aap Beeti

## Overview

Volume one of *Aap Beeti* (“My Own Story”) opens Khwaja Hasan Nizami’s twelve-part autobiography. Written in the wake of the Great War and the Delhi Darbar of 1911, it sketches the author’s upbringing within the Chishti khanqah of Nizamuddin, his apprenticeship under his father Khwaja Fazl-ud-Din, and the emergence of his voice as an Urdu journalist. Nizami records oral memories of 1857 survivors, pilgrim encounters in Ajmer, and the moral dilemmas he faced while fundraising for famine relief and Turkic war victims. His prose alternates between diary entries, character sketches, and interludes of devotional instruction, giving readers a grounded sense of Delhi’s neighbourhoods after the capital shifted from Calcutta.

## Key Themes

- Portraits of Delhi’s Sufi networks, their charitable kitchens, and their relationship with the colonial bureaucracy.
- Reflections on Urdu print culture, including the founding of *Mushir* and campaigns to protect Old Delhi monuments.
- Personal narratives of migration, poverty, and spiritual discipline that shaped Nizami’s later political interventions.

## Historical Significance

Unlike later nationalist memoirs, *Aap Beeti* preserves a Sufi scholar’s vantage on everyday governance during the transition to the imperial capital at Delhi. Historians of the 1910s and 1920s rely on Nizami’s recollections to reconstruct popular responses to the Balkan Wars, the Khilafat movement, and the preservation of Mughal heritage. The text also illustrates how Urdu autobiographical writing blended humour, sermon, and reportage to build a mass readership, influencing contemporaries such as Hasrat Mohani and Abdul Majid Daryabadi.

## Public Domain Status

Khwaja Hasan Nizami (1873–1955) died more than sixty years ago, which places his writings in the Indian public domain from 1 January 2016. This 1922 Delhi printing predates the 1928 US cut-off, so it is also in the public domain in the United States. The Internet Archive copy reproduces the Maulana Azad Library (AMU) scan without later editorial restrictions.

## Suggested Next Steps
- Populate genres, collections, and tags after review.
- Add additional sources (Wikisource, Gutenberg, OL) as available.
