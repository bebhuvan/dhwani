# Anecdotes of Aurangzeb

## Overview

Historian Jadunath Sarkar issued *Anecdotes of Aurangzeb* as the revised standalone English rendering of the seventeenth-century Persian compilation *Ahkam-i-Alamgir*, a dossier of imperial rescripts and court anecdotes gathered by Hamid-ud-din Khan, a high-ranking Mughal official. Sarkar pairs the translated orders with a compact narrative life of Aurangzeb, tracing the emperor’s rise from daring prince to battle-worn sovereign, and interleaves explanatory notes that map each document to events across the Deccan wars, the war of succession, and late-Mughal administration.

The 1925 second edition tightens Sarkar’s earlier 1912 translation by collating fresh manuscript readings, expanding annotations with findings from his five-volume *History of Aurangzib*, and disentangling the biography, essays, and Persian text that had previously appeared together. The result is a reference-ready dossier in which each anecdote or decree is footnoted with source manuscripts and cross-references to Persian chronicles, giving researchers a bilingual entry point into Islamic jurisprudence, fiscal governance, and moral rhetoric under Aurangzeb.

For Dhwani readers, Sarkar’s edition illuminates both the Mughal court’s internal dynamics—rivalries among Shah Jahan’s sons, petitions from frontier commanders, debates over religious policy—and the historiographical labour of early twentieth-century Indian scholars who sought to publish Persian archives in accessible English. The work complements the site’s Mughal holdings by offering primary materials that scholars still cite when reconstructing Aurangzeb’s household expenditures, diplomacy, and disciplinary style.

## Primary Source Verification

- Digital copy: Verified the 1925 “Second Edition, Revised” issued by M. C. Sarkar & Sons, Calcutta, via the Digital Library of India scan (133 pages) with cover, title page, bibliographical note, and advertisements intact.
- Contents: Volume opens with Sarkar’s bibliographical note detailing earlier printings (1912, 1915) before presenting the biography, followed by the translated orders with interleaved historical commentary and manuscript citations.
- Text quality: OCR confirms legible English prose; footnotes and Persian transliterations appear in roman type and remain readable in the downloadable PDF (`2015.102994.Anecdotes-Of-Aurangzeb_text.pdf`).

## Public Domain Confirmation
