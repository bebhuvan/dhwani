# India of Aurangzeb

## Overview

Published in 1901, *India of Aurangzeb* translates and annotates sections of the *Khulasat-ut-Tawarikh* and *Chahar Gulshan*—seventeenth-century Persian gazetteers that charted the Mughal Empire’s provinces and postal routes. Sarkar tabulates subahs, sarkars, and parganas; converts Persian itineraries into modern mileage; and supplements each route with notes drawn from the *Ain-i-Akbari*, European travelogues, and Survey of India maps. The book doubles as a handbook to Mughal administrative vocabulary, explaining the offices of mir-i-bahar, faujdar, and qanungo while tracing the flow of revenue and goods along imperial highways.

## Key Themes

- Stage-by-stage reconstructions of five major trunk roads linking Delhi to Kabul, Bengal, Gujarat, the Deccan, and the deep south.
- Provincial profiles that collate population estimates, principal towns, and strategic forts from Persian manuscripts and early colonial records.
- Glossaries and appendices that align Mughal territorial divisions with modern districts, aiding cartographic comparison.

## Historical Significance

Before the Archaeological Survey published facsimiles of the Persian texts, Sarkar’s volume offered historians a practical bridge to Mughal geography. It became indispensable to researchers studying the logistics of Aurangzeb’s Deccan campaigns, the growth of urban centres such as Ahmadnagar and Burhanpur, and the restructuring of postal networks after Shah Jahan. The work also demonstrates an early Indian effort to treat Persian administrative writing as data that could be plotted against contemporary cartography, anticipating later projects like Irfan Habib’s *Atlas of the Mughal Empire*.

## Public Domain Status

Jadunath Sarkar (1870–1958) died in 1958, placing his writings in the Indian public domain as of 1 January 2019. This Calcutta-issued 1901 volume predates 1928, and thus is also in the public domain in the United States. The Internet Archive scan reproduces a community-uploaded copy of the original edition without later editorial contributions.
