# History of Aurangzib: Based on Original Sources

## Overview

The opening volume of Sarkar’s five-part *History of Aurangzib* follows Prince Muhi-ud-din from his apprenticeship under Shah Jahan to the eve of the 1657–58 war of succession. Drawing on Persian narratives such as the *Ma’asir-i-Alamgiri*, Dutch and English factory diaries, and newly transcribed letters from the Rajasthan State Archives, Sarkar pieces together campaigns in the Deccan, the sieges of Bijapur and Golconda, and the imperial politics that set Aurangzeb against his brothers Dara Shikoh, Shah Shuja, and Murad. His prose—scholarly yet vivid—integrates battlefield logistics, revenue settlements, and court ceremonial, demonstrating how the prince balanced pietistic rhetoric with ruthless statecraft.

## Key Themes

- Strategic analysis of Aurangzeb’s Deccan expeditions, including sources on Maratha and Qutb Shahi diplomacy.
- Close reading of royal farmans, nobles’ correspondence, and Jesuit mission reports to reconstruct decision making.
- Assessment of Mughal fiscal reforms and military recruitment as drivers of imperial expansion.

## Historical Significance

Sarkar’s history anchored Mughal studies in document-based research, directly influencing later historians such as Satish Chandra and Muzaffar Alam. It provided Indian scholars with a counterpoint to colonial narratives that treated Aurangzeb solely through religious policy, demonstrating instead how political economy and personal ambition shaped the late seventeenth century. Volume I remains indispensable for understanding why Aurangzeb ultimately seized the Peacock Throne and how the empire’s administrative commitments in the Deccan set the stage for its eighteenth-century strains.

## Public Domain Status

Jadunath Sarkar (1870–1958) died more than sixty years ago; his works entered the Indian public domain on 1 January 2019. This London-issued volume predates 1928, placing it in the public domain in the United States as well. The Internet Archive scan reproduces a Google-digitised copy held by the University of Michigan without later editorial interventions.
