# Later Mughals, Volume I

## Overview

Originally serialized in the *Calcutta Review*, William Irvine’s *Later Mughals* charts the half-century of turmoil that followed Aurangzeb’s death. Jadunath Sarkar’s 1921 edition refines the text with fresh archival citations, glossaries of Persian terminology, and corrections drawn from the *Bahadur Shah Nama*, *Tarikh-i-Muhammadi*, and newly available Maratha records. Volume I narrates the reigns of Bahadur Shah I, Jahandar Shah, Farrukhsiyar, the Sayyid Brothers’ regency, and the catastrophe of Nadir Shah’s sack of Delhi in 1739, weaving diplomatic correspondence together with eyewitness memoirs to show how imperial authority fractured.

## Key Themes

- Detailed portraits of Delhi factional politics: the Qasuri nobles, the Sayyid Brothers, and the rise of Nizam-ul-Mulk.
- Accounts of provincial secessions in Awadh, Bengal, and the Deccan, incorporating Persian revenue documents and European factory reports.
- Military narratives covering the Persian invasion, the emergence of Maratha raiding networks, and shifts in artillery and cavalry tactics.

## Historical Significance

Sarkar’s editorial apparatus turned Irvine’s pioneering history into a reference work for twentieth-century scholars, supplying citations that tied narrative episodes to specific Persian manuscripts and European dispatches. The edition shaped modern understandings of Mughal decline, illustrating how court intrigue, fiscal decentralisation, and global trade pressures destabilised the empire long before 1857. For Dhwani, the volume complements earlier Mughal materials by documenting the empire’s twilight through multi-archival evidence.

## Public Domain Status

William Irvine (1840–1911) died well before 1964, and Jadunath Sarkar (1870–1958) passed away more than sixty years ago. Consequently, this 1921 Calcutta reissue is in the public domain in India (life + 60) and, being published before 1928, in the United States as well. The Internet Archive scan reproduces the edited volume with Sarkar’s introduction, footnotes, and folded maps intact.
