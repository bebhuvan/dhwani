# Life and Labour of the People of India

## Overview

Based on a series of lectures delivered at the Passmore Edwards Institute in London during 1905–06, *Life and Labour of the People of India* explains how India’s agrarian economy, artisanal industries, and urban professions functioned under the British Raj. Abdullah Yusuf Ali guides British audiences through village revenue structures, caste-based craft guilds, and the growing municipal workforce, arguing that Indian society possessed reservoirs of self-organisation often overlooked in imperial policy debates. The chapters move from rice fields and irrigation tanks to Calcutta’s dock labour and Bombay’s textile mills, using statistics drawn from provincial reports alongside impressions from Ali’s own ICS service. The book closes with reflections on education and political awakening, offering recommendations for administrative reform responsive to Indian aspirations.

## Key Themes

- Comparative portraits of rural tenancy systems and village institutions across Bengal, Bombay, and the Punjab.
- Analyses of handicraft decline and industrial labour migration in response to railway expansion and global markets.
- Commentary on education, civic life, and the early Swadeshi movement as engines of socio-economic change.

## Historical Significance

Published at the height of the Swadeshi agitation, Ali’s volume helped anglophone readers understand the political stakes of everyday labour conditions. It blended insider administrative knowledge with sympathy for Indian self-government, anticipating his later translations and public diplomacy. The book stands alongside William Digby’s and Romesh Chunder Dutt’s social surveys as a key primary source for historians tracing the transition from colonial welfare rhetoric to demands for responsible government. Its lecture-derived prose also preserves how Indian civil servants framed the “Indian problem” for sympathetic British audiences before the Morley–Minto reforms.

## Public Domain Status

Abdullah Yusuf Ali (1872–1953) died more than sixty years ago, placing this 1907 publication in the Indian public domain as of 1 January 2014. First issued by John Murray in London before 1928, the work is also in the public domain in the United States. The Internet Archive scan derives from a Google-digitised University of Michigan copy without later editorial restrictions.
