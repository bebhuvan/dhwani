# Dunya-e-Islam aur Masla-e-Khilafat

## Overview

Published in 1921 at the height of the Khilafat agitation, this treatise brings together historian Syed Sulaiman Nadvi’s speeches and articles on the future of the Ottoman Caliphate. Nadvi reviews the institution’s evolution from the Rashidun era to the Committee of Union and Progress, evaluates British wartime diplomacy, and interprets Qur’anic and Hadith precedents for Muslim political authority. He urges Indian Muslims to support diplomatic and economic pressure on Britain, arguing that safeguarding the Caliphate is essential for maintaining the moral unity of the *ummah* and strengthening Hindu–Muslim cooperation at home.

## Key Themes

- Detailed chronology of Ottoman constitutional reforms and their implications for Islamic governance.
- Juridical discussion of *ijma*, *bay‘at*, and delegated sovereignty, countering colonial narratives that dismissed the Caliphate as obsolete.
- Appeals for non-violent resistance—boycott, fundraising, and public education—as tools to influence imperial policy.

## Historical Significance

Nadvi, a disciple of Shibli Nomani and co-author of *Sirat-un-Nabi*, brought scholarly authority to the Khilafat movement’s demands. His text circulated in madrasas and Congress–Khilafat committees, shaping political sermons and pamphlets across North India. For Dhwani, the book exemplifies how historians engaged contemporary crises, translating archival knowledge into actionable guidance for mass movements.

## Primary Source Verification

- The scanned edition preserves Nadvi’s preface, appendices of telegrams, and references to Ottoman and British Government communiqués.
- OCR output is serviceable for Nastaliq, with minimal manual correction required.

## Public Domain Status

Syed Sulaiman Nadvi (1884–1953) died more than sixty years ago; his works entered the Indian public domain on 1 January 2014. First printed in 1921, the book is also in the public domain in the United States. No later editors altered the text in the extant scan.
