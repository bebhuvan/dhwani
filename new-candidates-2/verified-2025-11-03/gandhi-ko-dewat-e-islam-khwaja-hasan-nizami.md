# Gandhi ko Da‘wat-e-Islam (گاندھی کو اسلام کی دعوت)

## Overview

Written amid the Khilafat–Non-Cooperation alliance, Nizami’s pamphlet addresses Gandhi directly, praising his commitment to non-violence while introducing Islamic concepts of *tawhid*, *zuhd*, and *mujahada*. The author argues that Gandhi’s ethical programme resonates with Sufi ideals and urges him to recognise Islam as a partner in India’s moral regeneration. Through parables and Qur’anic citations, Nizami frames conversion not as a demand but as an invitation to mutual understanding, seeking to cement Hindu–Muslim solidarity against colonial rule.

## Key Themes

- Comparative exploration of Islamic ascetic practices and Gandhian vows of poverty, celibacy, and truthfulness.
- Historical references to earlier interfaith alliances in Delhi, reinforcing the city’s shared heritage.
- A concluding plea for cooperative nation-building grounded in spiritual humility rather than communal rivalry.

## Historical Significance

The pamphlet epitomises the optimism of 1920–22, when Khilafat committees and Congress worked in tandem. It also reveals anxieties about communal fissures, as Nizami uses devotional rhetoric to reinforce political unity. Scholars of interreligious dialogue cite the text to illustrate how Urdu prose engaged Gandhian thought and how Sufi leaders sought common ground with nationalist figures.

## Primary Source Verification

- The archived edition preserves Nizami’s preface, the full letter to Gandhi, and appendices containing telegrams exchanged during the Khilafat agitation.
- OCR accuracy is high, with minimal correction needed for Urdu diacritics.

## Public Domain Status

Khwaja Hasan Nizami (1873–1955) died more than sixty years ago; his writings are in the Indian public domain. Printed in 1922, the pamphlet is likewise public domain in the United States. The scanned copy shows no later editorial changes.
