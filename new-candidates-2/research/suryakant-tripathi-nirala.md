# Suryakant Tripathi "Nirala"

## Discovery Targets
- Digital Library of India (multiple pre-1948 editions)
- Hindi Sahitya Sammelan / Bharati Bhandar publications
- Archive.org community uploads (ensure provenance) and Indian university archives

## To-Do
- [x] Confirm authoritative name variants and scripts
- [x] Locate public-domain editions (<= 1961) with accessible scans
- [x] Capture IA identifiers, publication year, scan quality notes
- [ ] Collect secondary references (Wikipedia/Wikisource/Open Library)

## Findings Log
- Name: Suryakant Tripathi Nirala (Hindi: सूर्यकांत त्रिपाठी निराला). Wikidata Q3522878 ⇒ 1896-02-21 – 1961-10-15.
- Located works:
  - *Anamika* (Bharati Bhandar, Allahabad, 1948). IA id: `in.ernet.dli.2015.345935`; Hindi poetry collection; 210 pp; scanned by Banasthali University. Rights flagged PD.
  - *Sakhi* (likely Saraswati Press, 1935). IA id: `dli.ernet.522400`; Hindi prose-poetry volume; scan via C-DAC Noida.
- PD check: death 1961 ⇒ PD in India from 2022. Need to monitor later omnibus editions (e.g., *Rachanavali* 1960) for posthumous edits.
- Duplicate review: `rg` indicates no Nirala titles in current Dhwani catalog.
- Additional candidates: *Shukla Ki Biwi* (1941), *Kulli Bhat* (1958), *Geetika* (1945) – queue for subsequent passes.
- Next steps: extract poem lists (OCR absent in IA scan → requires manual review of PDF images), identify hallmark pieces, compile criticism (Chhayavad studies, Nirala scholarship) for references.

## Questions / Follow-ups
- Determine the exact imprint and edition statement for *Sakhi*; confirm if 1935 first edition is captured.
