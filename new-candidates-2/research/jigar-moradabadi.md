# Jigar Moradabadi

## Discovery Targets
- Urdu digital libraries (Rekhta, Urdu Adab, Anjuman Taraqqi-e-Urdu)
- Archive.org for authorized scans (DLI, Pakistani digital repositories)
- Audio archives (for performance context) – secondary priority

## To-Do
- [x] Confirm authoritative name variants and scripts
- [ ] Locate public-domain editions (<= 1960) with accessible scans
- [ ] Capture IA identifiers, publication year, scan quality notes
- [ ] Collect secondary references (Wikipedia/Wikisource/Open Library)

## Findings Log
- Name variants: "شجاعت علی خان جگر مرادآبادی" (Shujaat Ali Khan Jigar Moradabadi). Wikidata Q5809331 ⇒ 1890-04-06 – 1960-09-09.
- Archive.org currently yields mainly audio content (Radio Ceylon programs, music releases) but no verified text scans. Need to locate digitized divan editions—check Rekhta PDF downloads, Jamia Millia libraries, or DLI via alternate transliterations (e.g., "Jigar Muradabadi", "जिगर मुरादाबादी").
- Next steps: expand search to HathiTrust (public domain in US may be limited), consider contacting Rekhta for permissible PD downloads, probe Urdu e-mags.

## Questions / Follow-ups
- Determine which of Jigar’s diwans entered PD earliest (e.g., *Aatish-e-Gul*, *Shola-e-Toor*); confirm 1960 cutoff.
