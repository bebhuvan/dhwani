# Fani Badayuni

## Discovery Targets
- Archive.org Urdu poetry collections (DLI mirrors, Rekhta uploads)
- Other leads: HathiTrust (check PD in India vs US), Urdu Academy digital libraries

## To-Do
- [x] Confirm authoritative name variants and scripts
- [x] Locate candidate scans
- [ ] Capture publication year and edition provenance
- [ ] Collect secondary references (Wikipedia/Wikisource/Open Library)

## Findings Log
- Name variants: "Shaukat Ali Khan", pen name *Fani Badayuni* (Urdu: فانی بدایونی). Wikidata Q5433865 ⇒ 1879-09-13 – 1961-08-27.
- Located work: *Kulliyat-e-Fani* (collected poetry). IA id: `KulliyatEFani`; Urdu text; metadata lacks publication year/publisher. Needs inspection of scan (preface imprint) to ensure edition ≤ 1961 or confirm PD status via publisher info.
- PD implications: As author died 1961, Indian PD from 2022 onward for his own writings. Must verify that the collected edition is not a posthumous compilation with editorial contributions beyond PD range.
- Duplicate review: No Dhwani entry for Fani Badayuni or *Kulliyat-e-Fani*.
- Next steps: Download/open PDF to capture imprint details; identify table of contents, highlight notable ghazals, gather secondary references (Rekhta author page, Urdu literary histories).

## Questions / Follow-ups
- Determine publication location/year for the available IA scan; if post-1961 compilation with new editorial content, identify earlier editions (individual diwans) instead.
