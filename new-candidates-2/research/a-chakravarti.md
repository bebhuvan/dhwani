## Discovery Targets
- Digital Library of India scans (Tamil Jain literature translations)
- Madras Presidency / University of Madras archives
- Jain literature repositories (Acharya Kundakunda commentaries)

## To-Do
- [x] Confirm authoritative name variants and scripts
- [x] Locate public-domain editions (<= 1961) with accessible scans
- [ ] Capture IA identifiers, publication year, scan quality notes
- [ ] Collect secondary references (Wikipedia/Wikisource/Open Library)

## Findings Log
- Full name: Prof. A. Chakravarti (A. stands for “Annamalai”), philosophy professor at Presidency College, Madras; translator of Tirukkural and Jain texts. Wikidata Q42395199 ⇒ 1880-05-17 – 1960-02-12.
- Located work: *Neelakesi* (English translation), 1936. IA ids: `in.ernet.dli.2015.31742` / `in.ernet.dli.2015.504912`; 842 pp; English; DLI scan from Vir Seva Mandir collection. Requires verification of completeness (multiple volumes?).
- PD check: death 1960 ⇒ PD from 2021. Ensure commentary does not include later editors.
- Duplicate review: no Dhwani entries referencing A. Chakravarti or *Neelakesi*.
- Next steps: confirm whether translation includes foreword/preface with historical analysis, extract TOC, gather secondary references (Jain literature scholarship, Presidency College records).

## Questions / Follow-ups
- Determine if Chakravarti’s Tirukkural translation (possibly 1942) has a digitized edition; include in subsequent searches.
