# Sripada Krishnamurty Sastry

## Discovery Targets
- Archive.org (Telugu script searches)
- Digital Repositories: Andhra Pradesh State Archives, Telugu Virtual Library
- Sarada Niketanam Library uploads

## To-Do
- [x] Confirm authoritative name variants and scripts
- [x] Locate public-domain editions (<= 1961) with accessible scans
- [x] Capture IA identifiers, publication year, scan quality notes
- [ ] Collect secondary references (Wikipedia/Wikisource/Open Library)

## Findings Log
- Name variants: "శ్రీపాద కృష్ణమూర్తి శాస్త్రి" (Telugu). Wikidata Q7586468 ⇒ 1866 – 1960.
- Located work: *బొబ్బిలి యుద్ధ నాటకము (Bobbili Yuddha Natakamu)* (1922). IA id: `bd64e376cb94f5aef639a29c9ebcfd2175e65283`; Telugu historical drama; scan lacks descriptive metadata—need to extract imprint from front matter.
- PD check: death 1960 ⇒ PD since 2021; 1922 publication safely within window.
- Duplicate review: Dhwani catalog shows no Telugu entries for this title.
- Additional leads: Search for *Krishnasweeyacharitam* (autobiography) and poetic works within Sarada Niketanam collections.
- Next steps: download PDF for table of contents, capture historical context on Bobbili battle portrayals, gather critical reception references (Andhra Sahitya Parishat proceedings, Telugu theatre histories).

## Questions / Follow-ups
- Confirm whether the archive entry includes translator / stage direction notes requiring translation for metadata.
