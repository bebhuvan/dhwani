# Vattikota Alwar Swamy

## Discovery Targets
- Telugu Virtual Library (Government of Andhra Pradesh)
- Gowthami Grandhalayam digital repository
- Archive.org community uploads (check transliteration variants)
- University libraries (Osmania, Telangana State Central Library) for 1940s-50s political novels

## To-Do
- [x] Confirm authoritative name variants and scripts
- [ ] Locate public-domain editions (<= 1961) with accessible scans
- [ ] Capture IA identifiers, publication year, scan quality notes
- [ ] Collect secondary references (Wikipedia/Wikisource/Open Library)

## Findings Log
- Name variants: "Vattikota Alwar Swamy", "Vatikota Alwar Swamy" (Telugu: వట్టికోట ఆళ్వార్ స్వామి). Revolutionary writer, printer, publisher.
- Archive.org queries (romanized and Telugu script) currently return no matches. Need to search Telugu-centric portals and older catalogues for works like *Jailu* (జైలు), *Rakta Kanneeru*, *Telangana Swatantra Samaram*.
- Potential lead: check for magazines/newspapers printed by Vattikota (e.g., *Telangana* weekly) in digital news archives.

## Questions / Follow-ups
