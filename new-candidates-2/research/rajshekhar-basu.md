# Rajshekhar Basu (Parashuram)

## Discovery Targets
- Archive.org (M.C. Sarkar editions, Parashuram story collections)
- Indian language digital libraries (Bangla texts)
- Visva-Bharati / Calcutta University catalogues for authoritative editions

## To-Do
- [x] Confirm authoritative name variants and scripts
- [x] Locate public-domain editions (<= 1961) with accessible scans
- [ ] Capture IA identifiers, publication year, scan quality notes
- [ ] Collect secondary references (Wikipedia/Wikisource/Open Library)

## Findings Log
- Name variants: "পরশুরাম" (pen name). Wikidata Q6266938 ⇒ 1880-03-16 – 1960-04-27.
- Located work: *Chalantika: Adhunik Bangabhashar Abhidhan* (1937). IA id: `Chalantika_Adhunik_Bongovashar_Obhidhan_by_Rajshekhar_Basu_1937`; Bengali dictionary, M.C. Sarkar & Sons; scan missing pp. 504-505 and 560-561 requiring supplemental source.
- Additional leads: Parashuram’s short story collections (*Chamatkar*, etc.) exist on DLI but metadata inconsistent—need validation against authentic publication dates.
- PD check: death 1960 ⇒ works PD in India since 2021.
- Duplicate review: none in Dhwani catalog.
- Next steps: locate cleaner scan (possibly from DLI) or plan to note missing pages; gather secondary references (Bengali lexicography histories, Parashuram’s literary contributions).

## Questions / Follow-ups
