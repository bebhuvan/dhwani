description: "A 1932 Bengali play whose title (“Deluge”, “Upheaval”) signals crisis at the level of family and society.

# Pralay

## Overview

The play channels interwar anxieties—economic strain, political unrest, and changing social mores—into a plot that forces characters into difficult trade‑offs. Its rhetoric leans toward concentrated exchanges rather than lyrical monologues typical of earlier decades.

- Tasks: verify title page and verso for publication facts; note translator/editor if applicable.

## About the Author

Sengupta (1891–1961) helped consolidate a style of socially attentive dramaturgy. His interwar plays often juxtapose institutional duty with personal obligation, highlighting the costs of transition.

## Rights Checklist

- India PD: 60 years after author’s death (literary/dramatic/musical/artistic works).
- If translation: translator’s death year governs translation rights.
- Record evidence links for death year(s) and apply rule explicitly in the final entry.

## Duplicate Screening

- Run duplicate check against current catalog using title/author normalization.
- Distinguish new translations/editions from duplicates of the same edition.

## Source Integrity

- Capture the Archive identifier or stable catalog link.
- Prefer scans with complete, legible imprint pages.
- Add a direct file link (PDF/EPUB) if available for accessibility.
 
## Historical Context
 
The early 1930s saw intensified debates about labour, nationalism, and social reform in Bengal. Theatre reflected these struggles, with companies mounting plays that engaged topical concerns while negotiating censorship and audience taste.
 
## The Work
 
- Theme: social and moral “deluge” overturning settled certainties.
- Structure: acts/scenes arranged around dilemmas that lack clean resolutions.
- Idiom: plain yet intense Bengali suited to ensemble playing.
 
## Significance
 
- A representative interwar “problem play” that anticipates post‑war progressive theatre while retaining craft learned from earlier commercial stages.
- Useful to students of modern Bengali drama as a bridge from late‑colonial to post‑colonial dramaturgy.
 
## Editions & Sources
 
- Confirm publisher, city, and year from the title/verso; note any series imprint.
- Record the Archive identifier and any additional scans for comparison.
 
## Reading Guide
 
- Chart how the play defines “pralay”: economic, ethical, or political; identify the scenes where the definition sharpens.

## Performance Notes

- Favor brisk pacing to reflect interwar urgency; avoid melodramatic elongation.
- Use sound cues sparingly to support tension without overwhelming dialogue.

## Notes for Curators

- Record any prefaces, censorship certificates, or production notes if included in the edition.

## Analytical Questions

- What problem of interpretation does the text ask the reader to solve?
- How does diction (plain, elevated, technical) serve the argument or mood?
- Where does form (meter, prose cadence, scene structure) direct attention?
- What transitions mark shifts in time, perspective, or method?
- Which images or examples bear the argumentative or emotional load?
- How does the work balance tradition and innovation in its genre?
- What ethical claims are explicit, and which are implied by selection or framing?
- How are audience and purpose signaled in openings, prefaces, or asides?
- Where does the text resist paraphrase; what is gained or lost by summary?
- How do closing gestures (moral, question, silence) shape the after‑sense?

## Comparative Pairings

- Pair with one earlier and one later work in the same genre; track continuity and change.
- Compare with a vernacular/English translation to study choices of equivalence.
- Read alongside one critical essay; test its method against this text.
- Contrast with a work from a different region treating a similar theme.
- Examine how editorial apparatus (preface, notes) mediates reading across editions.
- Compare prose and verse treatments (if applicable) of a shared motif.
- Place beside a visual or performance representation; map gains/losses across media.
- Pair with one contemporary review (if findable) to recover reception context.
- Cross‑read with a policy or pedagogical document to see institutional echoes.
- Align with a dictionary/lexicon entry for key terms to fix technical nuance.

## Key Terms for Notes

- Define 8–12 terms that recur (technical, stylistic, thematic) using the edition’s spelling.
- Track aliases and transliteration variants to aid search across catalogs.
- Distinguish authorial coinages from inherited technical vocabulary.
- Record names and places with brief identifiers (person, movement, institution).
- Note recurring metaphors and their literal domains (nature, craft, law, devotion).
- Map one concept’s semantic field as used here vs. elsewhere in the tradition.

## Study Assignments

- Produce a 300‑word close reading of one paragraph/stanza/scene.
- Outline the table of contents and propose a two‑lecture plan.
- Prepare a glossary with 15 entries and two usage examples each.
- Compile a timeline linking text events to historical dates where relevant.
- Draft three examination questions targeting (a) recall, (b) analysis, (c) synthesis.
- Prepare a 5‑slide teaching deck with images/tables cited from the edition.
- Annotate one page facsimile with seals, marginalia, or typographic features.
- Propose an excerpt (1–3 pages) suitable for undergraduate syllabi with rationale.

## Appendix: Curatorial TODOs

- Verify imprint (publisher, city, year) from title and verso pages.
- Extract table of contents and add to the tracker with page spans.
- List proper names (people/places) with brief identifiers for searchability.
- Capture one page image to assess scan quality (contrast, margins, diacritics).
- Note any missing or repeated pages; flag need for alternate scans.
- Record edition‑specific features (preface, appendix, index) for citation.
- Prepare a 5–7 sentence abstract anchored in edition facts (no speculation).
- Identify two candidate excerpts (1–3 pages) suitable for teaching.
- Confirm PD status for all contributors/components (if anthology/translation).
- Add Archive identifier and direct file links to the tracker.
