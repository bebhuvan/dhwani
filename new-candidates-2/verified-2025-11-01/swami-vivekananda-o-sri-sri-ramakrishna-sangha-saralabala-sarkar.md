# Swami Vivekananda o Sri Sri Ramakrishna Sangha

## Overview

Published in Bhādra 1363 B.S. (September 1956) by Bengal Publishers, this Bengali volume offers the first book-length institutional history of the Ramakrishna Order written from the vantage point of a veteran lay worker. Saralabala Sarkar traces the Mission from the final months of Ramakrishna’s life through the consolidation of the Baranagar monastery and global expansion of Ramakrishna Math and Mission branches. Drawing on primary materials preserved by the Order—including Narendranath Datta’s twelve-point letter to Pramada Charan Mitra about organising the first community of monks, appendices of monastic rules, and Bengali translations of Vivekananda’s English lectures—the narrative explains how an informal circle of disciples transformed into a disciplined service organisation. Sarkar’s prose remains accessible for general readers while integrating documentary evidence that is otherwise scattered across institutional archives (Archive scan, ff. 15–124, 247–276).

## About the Author

Saralabala Sarkar (1880–1961) was a prolific Bengali essayist, translator, and social reformer who served the Ramakrishna Mission’s women’s education and relief initiatives for decades. Banglapedia notes that she edited journals, wrote biographies of religious figures, and helped institutionalise women’s participation in the Order’s cultural programmes. Her insider status—she collaborated with Sarada Devi’s companions and Mission presidents—allows her to blend eyewitness testimony, oral recollection, and Mission circulars into a cohesive public history. Sarkar’s death in 1961 places the work in the Indian public domain as of 1 January 2022 under Section 22 of the Indian Copyright Act (literary works enter the public domain 60 years after the author’s death).

## Historical Context

The book appears during the Mission’s rapid post-independence expansion, at a moment when Bengali readers sought authoritative, vernacular accounts of the Order’s origin. Sarkar writes in the aftermath of the Mission’s golden jubilee celebrations and after the publication of Swami Madhavananda’s English biography of Ramakrishna. She supplements these earlier works by documenting controversies that surrounded the early monastery—debates over preserving portions of Ramakrishna’s relics, the financial precariousness of the 1887 Baranagar setup, and the contributions of householders such as Balaram Bose and Suresh Chandra Mitra (Archive scan, ff. 45–68). Later chapters translate Vivekananda’s Chicago speeches, Calcutta lectures, and letters on education for Bengali audiences, situating them alongside mission bylaws adopted after incorporation under the Societies Registration Act. The appendices reproduce evolving rulebooks and committee reports, underscoring how ideals of renunciation were codified for service-era governance (Archive scan, ff. 247–276).

## Literary & Cultural Significance

Sarkar’s study preserves institutional memory at a moment when many first-generation disciples and lay patrons had passed away. Her insistence on juxtaposing anecdote with administrative records provides historians with reliable chronologies of branch foundations, relief operations, and educational projects before official English-language yearbooks became standard. The translations of Vivekananda’s addresses and the inclusion of directives on women’s participation helped make Mission ideals accessible to a wider Bengali readership, directly supporting the growth of women-led initiatives such as the Sarada Mission Sisterhood and Sarada Math. For Dhwani’s purposes, the work documents a major twentieth-century Indian religious organisation from an Indian woman’s perspective, coupling devotional respect with critical attention to governance and social service that continues to inform scholarship on modern Hindu movements.
