# Swami Vivekananda: Patriot-Prophet

## Overview

First issued by Nababharat Publishers in 1954, *Swami Vivekananda: Patriot-Prophet* reworks Bhupendranath Datta’s earlier youth-movement pamphlet *Vivekananda the Socialist* into a full-scale biography suited to post-Independence readers. Datta organises fourteen chapters that move from nineteenth-century Bengal’s intellectual milieu to Vivekananda’s public itineraries, institutional experiments, and sustained reflections on education, women, nationhood, and religious practice. The closing third of the volume anthologises key sayings—anthropological, sociological, national, educational, and gender-focused—with Datta’s commentaries that tie Vivekananda’s exhortations to contemporary reconstruction (pp. 345–417, Archive scan). The volume’s narrative spine therefore balances chronological storytelling with thematic dossiers designed to be used by civic activists, teachers, and Ramakrishna Order workers.

## About the Author

Bhupendranath Datta (1880–1961) trained in Calcutta, joined the revolutionary Jugantar circle, and later completed doctoral work in sociology at the University of Hamburg. He wrote widely on Indian social polity, tribal history, and nationalist thought, while serving as a public intellectual within the Ramakrishna-Vivekananda movement. His proximity to Vivekananda as younger brother, editor of *Jugantar*, and later as scholar gives the book both archival depth and interpretive distance; he quotes private correspondence preserved by the Order while cross-checking these sources against nationalist debates of the 1940s and 1950s.

## Historical Context

Datta’s introduction stresses that he is revising material first circulated to socialist youth workers in 1928–29 so that Vivekananda’s programme can address dilemmas of the sovereign republic (Introduction, Archive scan). He frames the biography against the confusion of goals he observed in 1950s India—Gandhian village utopias, Soviet models, and capitalist plutocracy—and argues that Vivekananda’s synthesis of “practical Vedānta” and service offers a stabilising national ideal. Each chapter sets Vivekananda’s speeches and letters alongside the Ramakrishna Mission’s institutional growth (schools, famine relief, women’s education), documenting how monastic regulations, service routines, and fund-raising adapted to independence-era demands. Because Datta died in 1961, the work has been in the public domain in India since 1 January 2022 (Indian Copyright Act, 1957, s. 22), and the first-edition imprint confirms a 1954 publication year well before the 1964 U.S. renewal threshold.

## Literary & Cultural Significance

The book remains one of the rare insider histories that combines family narrative, sociological analysis, and curated primary sources. Datta’s thematic chapters on Vivekananda as a thinker on nationhood, literature, and art (chs. XIII–XIV) foreground lesser-cited lectures, offering context for phrases that became mantras of the Ramakrishna Order’s service ethic. His commentated “Sayings” section supplied training materials for Ramakrishna Mission centres as they expanded adult education, refugee relief, and women’s programmes after 1947. Scholars of modern Hindu intellectual history still cite Datta for his mapping of Vivekananda’s engagements with labour politics and anti-colonial socialism, while historians of the Ramakrishna Mission value the documentation of internal regulations, ledger practices, and governance debates contained in appendices (pp. 418–422). The work therefore bridges hagiography and critical history, anchoring Vivekananda’s charisma in administrative, pedagogical, and social contexts that shaped the mission’s national role.
