## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ **6 works ready for Dhwani** - Can be added to main site immediately
2. **John Marshall "Taxila"** - Requires PD status clarification (technically PD since 2019 in India)

### Future Consideration
**7 works will become PD-eligible over next 44 years:**
- 2033: Benjamin Rowland (8 years)
- 2046: D.C. Sircar (21 years)
- 2048: Nalinaksha Sanyal (23 years)
- 2065: Mulk Raj Anand (40 years)
- 2069: Stuart Cary Welch (44 years)

**Create reminder system to add these as they enter PD.**

### Exclusion Criteria Applied
**Western Scholars on Indian Subjects:**
While several rejected works are by Western scholars (Bayly, Rowland, Welch, Beach, Marshall), the approved work by Percy Brown was included because:
- He lived/worked in India for 28 years
- His work became foundational to Indian architectural studies
- It's cited as standard reference by Indian scholars
- His institutional affiliations were primarily Indian (Lahore, Kolkata museums)

**If stricter "Indian authors only" criterion desired, Percy Brown could be excluded.**
