# Kulliyat-e-Fani (Collected Poems)

## Overview

The kulliyat (collected works) consolidates Fani Badayuni's poetic output across six decades, preserving classical ghazal apparatus—radif and qafiya constraints, matla opening couplets, maqta signature verses—while sustaining a diction attuned to ethical introspection, romantic ambiguity, and social observation. Published posthumously in complete form (1992), it documents the poet's evolution from early twentieth-century romantic idiom through later reflective registers.

## About the Author

Fani Badayuni (born Shaukat Ali Khan, 1879–1961) began composing poetry at age eleven in Badaun, North-Western Provinces. After earning an L.L.B. from Aligarh Muslim University (1906), he practiced law while maintaining an active literary career. The Nizam of Hyderabad's diwan appointed him to the education department, facilitating his dual professional and poetic pursuits. His work spans both ghazal (lyric couplet form) and nazm (thematic poem), representing continuity with classical Urdu tradition while engaging modern experience.

## The Work

The kulliyat preserves Fani's ghazal-centered corpus within traditional formal constraints:

**Prosodic Technique:**
- Mastery of radif (refrain) and qafiya (rhyme) without forced diction
- Strategic use of takhallus (pen-name signature) in maqta verses
- Balance of rhetorical figure (san'at) and thematic development (mazmun)

**Thematic Range:**
- Classical love's ambiguities and paradoxes
- Time, memory, and ethical self-scrutiny
- Public and private grief
- Social observation within ghazal's couplet logic
- Nazms extending beyond ghazal's formal constraints

**Literary Context:**
Fani wrote within the post-Ghalib Urdu ghazal tradition, maintaining classical prosody while absorbing early twentieth-century North Indian Muslim cultural anxieties. His work is frequently programmed alongside Ghalib, Iqbal, and later Faiz in ghazal-centered syllabi and mushaira (poetry gathering) traditions.

## Publication History

- First poetry collection: 1917
- Baqiyat-e-Fani: 1926
- Irfaniyat-e-Fani: 1938–1939
- Kulliyat-i Fani: 1992 (posthumous complete edition)

## Significance

The collected poems provide comprehensive access to Fani's corpus for:
- Metrical and prosodic analysis of classical Urdu verse forms
- Tracking semantic development of key lemmas across the diwan
- Understanding early twentieth-century Urdu poetic practice
- Teaching classical ghazal technique alongside modern masters

The work documents how traditional ghazal forms sustained relevance through colonial and post-colonial transitions in North Indian literary culture.
