# New History of the Marathas, Volume 1: Shivaji and His Line (1600-1707)

## Overview

Published 1946 by Phoenix Publications, Bombay. First of three volumes covering 1600-1818 Maratha history. Volume 1 spans 1600-1707: Shahaji Bhonsle's Bijapur service, Shivaji's 1674 coronation and kingdom consolidation, Sambhaji's reign (1680-89), Rajaram's resistance, Tarabai's regency during Aurangzeb's 27-year Deccan campaign ending with Mughal emperor's 1707 death. Based on Sardesai's 40-year career managing Baroda State archives and editing Peshwa Daftar documents—Persian farmans, Marathi administrative orders, Portuguese Estado da Índia records, English East India Company correspondence, Dutch VOC reports. 489 pages with maps, genealogical tables, appendices of key documents. Corrects Grant Duff's *History of the Mahrattas* (1826) and colonial-era histories portraying Marathas as decentralized raiders. Argues Shivaji created centralized administration with revenue systems (chauth, sardeshmukhi), diplomatic protocols, multilingual chancellery, and Hindu nationalist ideology enabling territorial empire rather than plunder-based confederacy.

## About Govind Sakharam Sardesai

Sardesai (1865-1958) born in Ratnagiri, Maharashtra. Graduated from Elphinstone College, Bombay. Appointed manager of Baroda State Records (1900), where he catalogued and published Peshwa Daftar—administrative archive of Maratha Peshwa government containing 18th-century Persian and Marathi documents seized by British after 1818 conquest. Edited *Selections from the Peshwa Daftar* (45 volumes, 1930-1934), making primary sources accessible. Published *Marathi Riyasat* (7 volumes in Marathi, 1925-1935), comprehensive Maratha history. *New History of the Marathas* represented English synthesis of lifetime's archival research. Served as member of Bombay Legislative Council. Received Sahitya Akademi Award (1955). Died 1958 age 93. Pioneer of modern Indian historiography using systematic archival methods rather than relying on British administrative histories or nationalist hagiography.

## Historical Context

British colonial histories of Marathas (Grant Duff 1826, Kincaid 1918, Duff 1921) depicted them as light cavalry raiders disrupting Mughal order without constructive state-building. These accounts served colonial ideological function by portraying British rule as bringing order to anarchic India. Nationalist historiography responded by celebrating Shivaji as Hindu resistance hero against Muslim oppression, often romanticizing rather than analyzing. Sardesai's work, written during late colonial period (1940s), combined nationalist pride in Maratha achievement with rigorous archival methodology. Demonstrated Shivaji built functioning state apparatus—land revenue systems, naval forces, diplomatic chancellery conducting correspondence in Persian, Marathi, Sanskrit—rather than temporary warlord coalition. Publication during 1946 (year before independence) contributed to constructing historical narrative of indigenous state-building capacity, countering colonial claims that Indians lacked administrative sophistication requiring British supervision.

## Content and Structure

**Part I - Origins (1600-1647)**: Traces Bhonsle family rise through service to Bijapur Sultanate. Details Shahaji's military career, jagir acquisitions, positioning son Shivaji in Pune region hills providing defensive terrain.

**Part II - Shivaji's Kingdom (1647-1680)**: Chronicles fort captures beginning with Torna (1646), Bijapur conflicts, confrontations with Mughals (Afzal Khan encounter 1659, Purandar Treaty 1665, Agra escape 1666), 1674 coronation establishing Hindu kingship with Brahmin legitimation. Analyzes administrative innovations: *Ashtapradhan* (eight-minister council), revenue settlements, fort command structures, naval development combating Portuguese and English, religious policies (Brahmin privileges, Muslim official employment, temple endowments).

**Part III - Succession Crisis (1680-1689)**: Examines Sambhaji's contested succession, conflicts with brother Rajaram, confrontation with Aurangzeb culminating in 1689 capture and execution. Details psychological portrait of Sambhaji's volatile personality affecting governance.

**Part IV - Survival (1689-1707)**: Chronicles Rajaram's flight to Jinji fort, continuation of resistance from southern stronghold while Aurangzeb besieged Maratha forts. Details Tarabai's regency after Rajaram's 1700 death, her leadership during final Aurangzeb campaign years. Argues Maratha survival against overwhelming Mughal military force demonstrated state's institutional resilience beyond individual leaders.

**Military Analysis**: Detailed examination of guerrilla tactics (*ganimi kava*)—fort networks controlling passes, light cavalry mobility, monsoon campaign advantages, avoiding pitched battles. Contrasts with Mughal siege warfare requiring massive logistics.

**Administrative Detail**: Revenue collection methods, fort command appointments, diplomatic correspondence protocols, mint operations, judicial systems. Documentary evidence of functioning bureaucracy rather than improvised warlord organization.

## Significance

**Historiographical Shift**: Established Marathas as sophisticated state-builders rather than raiders. Influenced subsequent scholarship on regional Indian states, demonstrating indigenous political formations possessed administrative complexity comparable to Mughal or European systems.

**Primary Source Access**: Made Persian and Marathi documents accessible to English-reading scholars. Appendices included translations of key farmans, letters, administrative orders previously unavailable, enabling verification of historical claims.

**Nationalist Historiography**: Contributed to post-independence Indian historical narrative emphasizing indigenous state-building traditions. Countered colonial-era claims that only British provided modern administration to India lacking governance capacity.

**Regional History Model**: Pioneered regional history methodology focusing on specific political formations rather than all-India narratives dominated by Mughal or British perspectives. Influenced Maharashtra regional historical scholarship.

**Academic Standard**: Remains standard academic reference for Maratha history. Later scholars (Stewart Gordon, André Wink, Sumit Guha) build upon Sardesai's archival foundations while revising interpretations. Volume 2 covers 1707-1772 (Peshwa dominance), Volume 3 covers 1772-1818 (decline and British conquest).
