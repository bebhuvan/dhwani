## Overview

Comprehensive survey of Jain literature spanning 2,500 years from Mahavira's teachings (6th century BCE) through 20th-century Hindi Jain writing. Two-part structure: Part I covers Jain historical development—Mahavira's life and teachings, canonical text formation, Digambara-Shvetambara schism (1st-2nd century CE), medieval patronage under Chalukyas/Rashtrakutas/Solankis, geographic spread from Bihar/UP through Gujarat/Rajasthan to Karnataka. Part II surveys literary production by language: Prakrit canonical texts (*Agamas*, *Angas*, *Upangas*), Sanskrit philosophical treatises (Umasvati's *Tattvarthasutra*, Haribhadra's works, Hemachandra's grammar/poetics), Apabhramsha narrative poems (Swayambhu's *Pauma Chariya*, Pushpadanta's *Mahapurana*), medieval Gujarati literature (Hemachandra's *Dvi-Ashraya-Kavya*, Yashovijaya's devotional works), Rajasthani hagiographies and pilgrimage texts, modern Hindi Jain poetry and prose. Provides bibliographic detail: manuscript locations in bhandaras (Jain libraries), published editions, scholarly controversies over authorship/dating, textual transmission history. First systematic Hindi-language treatment making Jain literary scholarship accessible beyond Prakrit/Sanskrit specialists. Premi's position as insider (Jain layperson) with scholarly training enabled authoritative treatment combining religious knowledge with critical methodology.

## About Nathuram Premi

Premi (1881-1960) born in Manda, Madhya Pradesh, into Digambara Jain family. Moved to Bombay for education and business. Became Hindi literary figure while maintaining Jain religious commitment. Founded Hindi Granth Ratnakar Karyalaya publishing house (1911) promoting Hindi literature, including Jain texts. Edited *Jaina Siddhanta Bhaskar* magazine (1904-1914) disseminating Jain philosophy in accessible Hindi. Published editions of medieval Jain texts with Hindi translations and commentaries, making canonical literature available to modern readers. Wrote extensively: hagiographies of Jain saints, introductions to Jain philosophy, literary histories, bibliographic catalogs. *Jain Sahitya Aur Itihas* represented lifetime's scholarship synthesizing historical research, literary analysis, religious knowledge. Active in Jain community organization, balancing traditional religious identity with modern scholarly methodology. Died 1960, having established Hindi as legitimate language for Jain scholarship alongside traditional Prakrit/Sanskrit.

## Historical Context

Jainism, founded by Mahavira (6th century BCE contemporary of Buddha), developed extensive literary tradition in multiple languages. Early canonical texts composed in Ardha-Magadhi Prakrit, oral transmission for centuries before manuscript fixation (3rd-5th century CE). Digambara-Shvetambara schism produced different canons—Shvetambaras preserve larger textual corpus, Digambaras claim original canon lost. Medieval period (6th-14th centuries) saw flowering of Jain Sanskrit philosophical literature engaging Buddhist and Hindu schools in sophisticated debates. Apabhramsha, transitional language between Prakrit and modern vernaculars, became Jain literary language (7th-14th centuries) for narrative poetry retelling Jain versions of epics—Jain Ramayana, Jain Mahabharata. Regional vernaculars (Gujarati, Rajasthani, Kannada) developed Jain literature from 12th century onward. Modern period witnessed Jain community anxiety about declining religious knowledge—manuscript traditions restricted to monks, laypeople increasingly Westernized and Hindi-educated but unable to read Prakrit/Sanskrit texts. Premi's project addressed this crisis by producing accessible Hindi scholarship enabling educated laypeople to understand their literary heritage.

## Content and Structure

**Part I - Historical Development**: Traces Jainism from Mahavira's 6th-century BCE teachings through ancient Magadha kingdom, spread to Western India under Mauryan patronage, southern expansion into Karnataka (Digambara stronghold), medieval Gujarat-Rajasthan prosperity under Solanki/Guhila dynasties. Discusses doctrinal development: karma theory systematization, universe cosmology, logic and epistemology (Jain saptabhangi seven-fold predication, syadvada conditional assertion), ethics (ahimsa non-violence, anekantavada multiple-viewpoint pluralism). Chronicles Digambara-Shvetambara schism's historical development and doctrinal differences: monk nudity, women's spiritual capacity, canonical text authority, idol worship practices.

**Part II - Literary Survey by Language**:

**Prakrit Literature**: Describes Shvetambara canon's structure (12 Angas, 12 Upangas, 10 Painnas, 6 Chheda Sutras, 4 Mula Sutras, 2 Culikas). Explains each text's content, attributed authorship, manuscript tradition, scholarly debates over authenticity. Discusses Digambara claim that original canon lost, their substitute texts.

**Sanskrit Philosophical Works**: Analyzes Umasvati's *Tattvarthasutra* (c. 2nd century CE), foundational text accepted by both sects. Examines Haribhadra's (8th century) philosophical works engaging Buddhist logic. Details Hemachandra's (12th century) massive scholarly production: *Siddha-Hema-Shabdanushasana* (Sanskrit grammar), *Kavyanushasana* (poetics), *Abhidhana-Chintamani* (lexicon), *Yogashastra* (Jain yoga system), *Trishashti-Shalaka-Purusha-Charitra* (hagiographies).

**Apabhramsha Poetry**: Discusses Swayambhu's *Pauma Chariya* (Jain Ramayana), Pushpadanta's *Mahapurana* (Jain universal history), narrative techniques adapting epic stories to Jain ethics—Rama becomes ideal Jain layman observing ahimsa.

**Regional Vernacular Literature**: Surveys Gujarati Jain texts (hagiographies, pilgrimage guides, devotional poetry), Rajasthani *rasau* poetry and *prabandha* prose narratives, Kannada Digambara literature from Karnataka.

**Bibliographic Information**: Each text discussed with manuscript locations (Jess alma Bhandar, Patan Bhandar, other Jain libraries), published editions, scholarly work, textual variants.

## Significance

**Jain Studies Foundation**: Established comprehensive framework for Jain literary history, organizing vast corpus chronologically and linguistically. Subsequent Jain scholarship built upon Premi's organizational structure. Influenced academic Jain studies programs at Indian universities.

**Hindi Language Legitimation**: Demonstrated Hindi's capacity for rigorous religious scholarship, countering assumptions that Jain studies required Prakrit/Sanskrit. Made Jain literary heritage accessible to modern Hindi-educated Jains, addressing community's language transition crisis.

**Insider-Scholar Model**: Combined religious commitment with critical methodology—neither apologetics nor hostile outsider analysis. Balanced faith-based understanding with scholarly rigor, model later adopted by religious studies scholars studying traditions from within.

**Manuscript Documentation**: Catalogued manuscript locations in Jain bhandaras, facilitating later scholarly access. Many manuscripts mentioned remain primary sources for Jain textual studies.

**Literary Recovery**: Drew attention to Apabhramsha Jain poetry, relatively neglected transitional literature. Premi's discussion stimulated subsequent scholarly interest in Apabhramsha as important phase in Indo-Aryan literary development.

**Comparative Literature**: Examined Jain literary techniques adapting mainstream narratives (Ramayana, Mahabharata) to Jain ethics, demonstrating sophisticated narrative strategies for competing within pluralistic literary culture while maintaining doctrinal distinctiveness.

**Community Impact**: Educated Jain laypeople about their literary heritage, strengthening community identity during modern period's challenges. Used in Jain educational institutions teaching religious knowledge to youth increasingly distant from traditional Prakrit learning.
