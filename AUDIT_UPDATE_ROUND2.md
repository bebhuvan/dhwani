**Date:** November 15, 2025
**Update Type:** Corrections & Additional Discoveries

---

## Summary of Changes

### 1. False Negatives Corrected (2 works)
Works I incorrectly identified as missing that are **already in repository**:

| eBook ID | Title | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| 44250 | Der König der dunklen Kammer (Tagore - German) | ✅ Already in repo |
| 65541 | Gitanjali (Sangesopfer) (Tagore - German) | ✅ Already in repo |

**Revised Count:** 53 truly missing from original audit (not 55)

### 2. Newly Discovered Missing Works (12 works)

#### A. H.P. Blavatsky - Theosophical Works (9 works)

| eBook ID | Title | Priority | Relevance to India |
|----------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| 68705 | Isis Unveiled, Volume 1 - Science | Medium | References to Indian philosophy, Vedas |
| 75871 | Isis Unveiled, Volume 2 - Theology | Medium | Buddhist/Hindu philosophy comparisons |
| 54824 | The Secret Doctrine, Vol. 1 of 4 | Low-Medium | Theosophical cosmology, Indian references |
| 54488 | The Secret Doctrine, Vol. 2 of 4 | Low-Medium | Continuation of Vol. 1 |
| 56880 | The Secret Doctrine, Vol. 3 of 4 | Low | Theosophical teachings |
| 61626 | The Secret Doctrine, Vol. 4 of 4 | Low | Theosophical teachings |
| 55618 | The Key to Theosophy | Low-Medium | Explanatory work on theosophy |
| 17009 | Studies in Occultism | Low | Occult philosophy |
| 44559 | Nightmare Tales | Low | Fiction |

**Note:** Repository already has "From the Caves and Jungles of Hindostan" (6687) by Blavatsky.

**Recommendation:** Add Isis Unveiled (both volumes) as MEDIUM priority - these works engage substantively with Indian philosophy. The Secret Doctrine volumes are more purely theosophical and have lower relevance to Indian cultural heritage.

#### B. Jiddu Krishnamurti (1 work)

| eBook ID | Title | Priority | Relevance to India |
|----------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| 11345 | Education As Service | Medium | Indian philosopher, discusses Benares, Hindu College, Indian education |

**Recommendation:** MEDIUM priority - Krishnamurti is an important 20th-century Indian philosopher associated with theosophy and later independent spiritual teaching.

#### C. Sufi/Islamic Mysticism (2 works)

| eBook ID | Title | Author | Priority | Relevance to India |
|----------|-------|--------|----------|-------------------|
| 24314 | Mystics and Saints of Islam | Claud Field | Medium | Islamic mysticism with Indian Sufi connections |
| 67388 | The Mystics of Islam | Reynold A. Nicholson | Medium | Sufi philosophy, Persian-Indian connections |

**Recommendation:** MEDIUM priority - Sufism had profound influence on Indian culture, especially in poetry (Iqbal, Rumi) and devotional traditions. These provide context for Indian Sufi works already in repository.
