## Search Strategy Notes

**What Worked Well**:
- Browsing Library of Congress PK (Indo-Iranian) classification
- Searching for specific philosophical schools (Vedanta, Yoga)
- Looking for religious traditions (Sufism, Sikhism)
- Exploring Indo-Iranian connections (Persian, Urdu)
- Searching for prominent figures (Besant, Iqbal, Kabir)
- Architecture and art as separate category

**Gaps Still Remaining**:
- Limited Marathi/Gujarati/Kannada/Malayalam original language works
- No Tulsidas (Ramcharitmanas not on Gutenberg)
- No Aryabhatiya (ancient mathematics/astronomy)
- No Arthashastra (Kautilya)
- Limited scientific/mathematical texts
- Few works in regional languages besides Bengali

**Why These Gaps Exist**:
- Copyright restrictions (many regional language works post-1928)
- Translation availability (many texts never translated to English)
- Gutenberg's focus on English/European languages
- Later 20th century works still under copyright
