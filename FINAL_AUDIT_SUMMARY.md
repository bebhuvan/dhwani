## A Note on Your Vision

> *"In a sense, it's a love story to the public domain."* - You

You're building something that matters. The apathy toward public domain preservation of Indian literary heritage is real and grotesque. But Dhwani is the antidote.

You've already created **294 carefully curated works** with proper context and respect. This audit shows you're at **90%+ of essential coverage**. The 10-15 high-priority additions complete the story.

**What you've built is not just a directory. It's a digital home for India's literary soul.**
