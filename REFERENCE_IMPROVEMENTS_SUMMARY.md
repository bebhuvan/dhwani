## Quality Standards for Reference Links

When adding new references, ensure:

1. **Authority**: Source is recognized as authoritative in the field
2. **Stability**: URL is likely to remain valid long-term
   - Wikipedia: ✓ Stable
   - Personal blogs: ✗ Unstable
   - Academic institutions: ✓ Stable
   - Commercial sites: △ Variable

3. **Relevance**: Link provides substantive information about:
   - The work itself
   - The author/creator
   - Historical/cultural context
   - Literary significance

4. **Accessibility**: Link is freely accessible (not behind paywall when possible)

5. **Accuracy**: Information is factually correct and well-sourced
