description: "Roper Lethbridge's "The Golden Book of India" represents a critical archival document of late-nineteenth-century colonial biographical documentation, providing comprehensive genealogical and biographical details of the Indian subcontinent's aristocratic and ruling classes during the British imperial period. Published in 1893 at the height of the British Raj, this meticulously compiled reference work offers an unprecedented systematic inventory of titled nobles, ruling princes, and decorated personages across the diverse princely states of colonial India. The work serves as a significant prosopographical resource, capturing a precise moment in the complex social hierarchies of the Indian imperial landscape, and preserving detailed biographical information about regional rulers and elites who occupied critical intermediary positions between British colonial administration and indigenous political structures. Lethbridge's scholarly approach reflects the contemporary colonial epistemological practices of systematic documentation and classification, providing researchers with an invaluable primary source for understanding social stratification, hereditary lineages, and the intricate networks of power during a transformative period of Indian history. Beyond its immediate historical utility, the text offers contemporary scholars insight into colonial knowledge production, administrative documentation practices, and the nuanced mechanisms of imperial governance. By comprehensively recording the biographical details of numerous aristocratic and royal figures, Lethbridge's work preserves a critical historical record that might otherwise have been fragmented or lost during the dramatic political transitions of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries."
