description: "Douglas Craven Phillott's "Colloquial English-Persian Dictionary" represents a significant linguistic endeavor during the late colonial period, offering a comprehensive lexicographic resource that bridges English and Persian linguistic domains. Published in 1914 in Calcutta, the dictionary emerges from the rich scholarly and administrative context of British India, where multilingual competence was crucial for colonial governance and intercultural communication. By presenting English words in Roman characters alongside their modern Persian equivalents and providing numerous contextual examples, Phillott's work facilitates linguistic translation and cultural understanding during a period of intense colonial linguistic documentation and exchange. The dictionary's methodological approach reflects the emerging discipline of comparative linguistics and the British imperial project of systematically cataloging and standardizing linguistic knowledge in the Indian subcontinent. Its particular significance lies in preserving colloquial language usage, moving beyond formal literary representations to capture the dynamic, everyday linguistic interactions between English and Persian speakers. For scholars of linguistic history, colonial studies, and South Asian intellectual heritage, this dictionary offers invaluable insights into the linguistic landscape of early 20th-century India, demonstrating the complex linguistic negotiations and transformations occurring during the late colonial period. Phillott's meticulous compilation not only serves as a practical reference tool but also functions as a critical historical document illuminating the intricate linguistic and cultural exchanges that characterized British imperial interactions in the region."
