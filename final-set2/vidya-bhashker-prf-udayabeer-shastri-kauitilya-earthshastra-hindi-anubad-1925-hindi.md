description: "Vidya Bhashker and Udayabeer Shastri's 1925 Hindi translation of the Arthashastra represents a critical scholarly intervention in making Kautilya's seminal treatise on statecraft, economic policy, and governance accessible to a broader Hindi-speaking readership. Produced during the late colonial period, this translation emerges at a crucial moment of Indian intellectual renaissance, when scholars were systematically recovering and reinterpreting classical Sanskrit texts to reconstruct indigenous knowledge systems. The Arthashastra, traditionally attributed to Chanakya (Kautilya), the chief minister of the Mauryan Emperor Chandragupta (c. 321-297 BCE), is a comprehensive administrative manual that offers sophisticated insights into ancient Indian political administration, economic strategy, diplomatic protocols, and military organization. Bhashker and Shastri's translation contributes significantly to the scholarly discourse by rendering this complex philosophical and administrative text into a vernacular language, thereby bridging classical Sanskrit scholarship with modern Hindi intellectual traditions. Their work not only facilitates wider scholarly engagement but also participates in the broader nationalist project of cultural retrieval and intellectual self-understanding during the early 20th century. By meticulously translating this foundational text, the authors provide researchers, historians, and cultural scholars with an important interpretive resource for understanding the depth and complexity of ancient Indian political thought, administrative technologies, and socio-economic organizational principles."
