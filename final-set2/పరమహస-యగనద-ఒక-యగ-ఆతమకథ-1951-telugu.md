description: "Paramahansa Yogananda's "Autobiography of a Yogi" represents a pivotal text in transnational spiritual literature, bridging Hindu philosophical traditions with Western metaphysical discourse during the mid-20th century. Originally published in English in 1946 and subsequently translated into multiple languages, the work offers a nuanced autobiographical account that explores the intersections of mystical experience, yogic philosophy, and personal spiritual transformation. By presenting his life narrative through a lens of philosophical introspection, Yogananda systematically introduces Western readers to complex Hindu contemplative practices, particularly Kriya Yoga, while simultaneously demystifying esoteric spiritual concepts. The text is significant not merely as a personal memoir but as a critical document of cultural translation, illustrating how traditional Indian spiritual knowledge could be comprehensively articulated for a global audience. Yogananda's methodical exposition of yogic principles, interwoven with personal experiences and encounters with spiritual masters, provides a sophisticated hermeneutic framework for understanding meditation, consciousness, and metaphysical phenomena. Importantly, the work emerges during a transformative period of global intellectual exchange, when India's spiritual traditions were increasingly engaging with Western philosophical and psychological paradigms. As a literary artifact, the autobiography contributes substantially to understanding 20th-century cross-cultural spiritual discourse, demonstrating how individual narrative could serve as a powerful medium for philosophical and cultural communication."
