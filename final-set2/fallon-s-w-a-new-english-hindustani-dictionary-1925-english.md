description: "Fallon's A New English Hindustani Dictionary represents a critical lexicographic intervention in early 20th-century linguistic documentation of the Indian subcontinent's complex linguistic landscape. Published in 1925, the dictionary emerges during a pivotal period of colonial linguistic scholarship, offering a comprehensive bilingual lexical resource that bridges English and Hindustani—a linguistic designation encompassing Urdu and Hindi variants. Fallon's work is significant not merely as a linguistic tool but as a scholarly document reflecting the intricate linguistic negotiations of colonial India, capturing the nuanced lexical exchanges between metropolitan and indigenous language systems. The dictionary provides extensive semantic mappings that reveal contemporary linguistic practices, cultural terminology, and the semantic boundaries of linguistic communication during a transformative period of South Asian intellectual history. By meticulously documenting lexical equivalences, Fallon contributes to the broader colonial-era linguistic projects of documentation, translation, and cultural mediation. The dictionary serves as a critical resource for contemporary scholars of historical linguistics, colonial studies, and South Asian intellectual history, offering insights into the complex linguistic taxonomies and communicative practices of early 20th-century India. Beyond its immediate lexicographic function, the work represents an important scholarly artifact that illuminates the intellectual methodologies of linguistic documentation during a period of profound cultural and political transformation in the Indian subcontinent."
