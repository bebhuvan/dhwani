description: "The Yajnavalkya Smriti represents a seminal text in classical Hindu jurisprudence, offering comprehensive insights into the normative legal and social frameworks of medieval India. Compiled in the early medieval period, likely between the 6th and 8th centuries CE, this dharmaśāstra (normative legal text) provides intricate guidelines on social conduct, ritual obligations, inheritance, and judicial procedures. Translated by Rai Bahadur Srisa Chandra Vidyarnava with the authoritative commentaries of Vijnanevara's Mitaksara and Balambhatta's extensive glosses, this work illuminates the sophisticated legal reasoning and ethical principles underlying traditional Indian societal governance. The text is particularly significant for its nuanced discussions of familial law, property rights, and the hierarchical structures that defined social interactions during this historical period. Vijnanevara's Mitaksara commentary, which became foundational to Brahminical legal interpretation across the Indian subcontinent, transforms the Yajnavalkya Smriti from a mere prescriptive text into a complex hermeneutical system of legal philosophy. By systematically elaborating on inheritance protocols, judicial processes, and ritual obligations, the text provides scholars with an unparalleled window into the intellectual and normative frameworks that structured medieval Indian society. Vidyarnava's English translation makes this critical scholarly resource accessible to a broader international audience, facilitating comparative legal and anthropological research into traditional Indian normative systems."
