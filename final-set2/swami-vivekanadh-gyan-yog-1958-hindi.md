description: "Swami Vivekananda's Gyan-yog (1958) represents a critical philosophical exploration of knowledge acquisition and spiritual understanding within the Vedantic philosophical tradition. This seminal text examines the path of intellectual and spiritual enlightenment through systematic philosophical inquiry, drawing upon classical Indian epistemological frameworks and metaphysical concepts. Vivekananda, a pivotal figure in late 19th and early 20th-century Indian philosophical discourse, articulates a nuanced approach to transcendental knowledge that bridges traditional Vedantic thought with emerging modern intellectual paradigms. The work elaborates on the philosophical concept of Jnana Yoga—the yoga of knowledge—as a transformative intellectual and spiritual discipline, emphasizing rational contemplation, self-realization, and the systematic deconstruction of phenomenological experience. By synthesizing complex metaphysical concepts with accessible philosophical language, Vivekananda contributes significantly to the intellectual migration of Indian philosophical thought into global philosophical conversations. The text is particularly notable for its sophisticated analysis of consciousness, epistemological boundaries, and the relationship between empirical perception and transcendental awareness. As a foundational work in modern Indian philosophy, Gyan-yog exemplifies Vivekananda's broader project of reinterpreting classical Vedantic principles for a contemporary intellectual audience, demonstrating the dynamic and adaptive nature of Indian philosophical traditions in the mid-20th century."
