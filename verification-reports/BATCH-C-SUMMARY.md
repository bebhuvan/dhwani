## Next Steps

### For Phase 2 (8 works ready):
1. Proceed with content extraction
2. Format validation
3. Database ingestion

### For Human Review (12 works):
1. **Priority High** (PROBABLE - 8 works):
   - Research Indian author death dates
   - Verify institutional authorship for Linguistic Society works
   - Confirm exact 1929 publication dates

2. **Priority Medium** (UNCERTAIN - 4 works):
   - Research Pathak Ramaraksha (1949 author)
   - Research Ambikadatt Shastri (translator, possibly still in copyright)
   - Consider waiting for 80-year threshold (2029, 2034)
