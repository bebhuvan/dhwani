**Solution:** Prioritized concrete nouns (names, places, dates) over adjectives; eliminated all filler words

### Challenge 3: Avoiding repetitive biographical structures
**Solution:** Varied opening sentences, emphasized unique contributions of each scholar

### Challenge 4: C-DAK, SV, "City" genre classifications
**Solution:** These appear to be data quality issues from Phase 1; flagged for correction
