- **Usage:** Will be used in Phase 2 to write high-quality author biographies

---

## API Query Strategy

Each work went through a systematic 7-step query process:

1. **Wikipedia: Work** - Search for the work title
2. **Wikipedia: Author(s)** - Search for up to 2 authors
3. **Wikidata: Work** - Search for work entity and Q-number
4. **Wikidata: Author(s)** - Search for author entities, extract birth/death dates
5. **OpenLibrary: Work** - Search for work and work key
6. **OpenLibrary: Author** - Search for first author
7. **Wikisource: Work** - Check if work is available on Wikisource

### Rate Limiting:
- 1-second delay between each API call
- Respectful of API usage guidelines
- Total processing time: ~3-4 minutes for 20 works

## Quality Assessment

### Strengths:
- ✓ 80% of works met the 3+ reference minimum
- ✓ Average of 5.05 references per work (exceeds target)
- ✓ Good diversity of reference sources (4 different APIs)
- ✓ Comprehensive author biographical data collected
- ✓ All API calls rate-limited appropriately

### Areas for Improvement:
- 4 works (20%) fell below the 3-reference minimum
- Some author searches matched generic terms (e.g., "Gupta" → surname page)
- Hindi/Bengali works have less English API coverage
- Some Wikidata searches didn't find specific work entities

### Recommendations:
1. For works below minimum: Manual curation recommended
2. Consider adding language-specific Wikipedia API queries (hi.wikipedia, bn.wikipedia)
3. For well-known classical works: Add JSTOR, WorldCat, or academic database links manually
4. Validate author biographical data before using in Phase 2

## Technical Notes

### YAML Parsing Challenges:
- Initial issues with nested quotes in description fields
- Solution: Implemented ruamel.yaml with quote preservation
- Handled edge case where frontmatter delimiter was concatenated with body text

### API Response Handling:
- Graceful fallback for failed API calls
- Extracted structured data from Wikidata claims (P569/P570 for dates)
- Normalized URLs across different API response formats

### Processing Pipeline:
```
Read File → Parse YAML → Extract Metadata →
Query 4 APIs (7 steps) → Build References Array →
Update Frontmatter → Save File → Collect Author Bio Data
```
