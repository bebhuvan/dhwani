## ⚠️ Known Limitations

What these works **DON'T** have (yet):

1. **Multiple Archive.org editions** - Most have only 1 source
   - Could manually search for more editions later

2. **OpenLibrary work links** - Not included
   - Most have OpenLibrary search URLs that need to be verified manually

3. **Wikisource links** - Not systematically added
   - Could be added manually for works available on Wikisource

These are **enhancements** that can be done later if needed. The works are ready to publish as-is.
